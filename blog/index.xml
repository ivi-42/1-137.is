      <description>PPO I am doing the hugging face Reinforcement Learning Course. It is quite nice, and I though I was going to put some thoughts.
The first corse parameters is about PPO.
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is an algorithm for training reinforcement learning (RL) agents. RL is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal.
The goal of PPO is to improve the performance of an RL agent by making small, incremental updates to its policy (the strategy the agent uses to choose actions).</description>

      <description>What 137.is? It is a tool that experiment in how a company can work, and see how much a fully distributed system is able to solve problems efficently. This project uses soft computing, on the opposite of hard computing, the terms &amp;ldquo;soft computing&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;hard computing&amp;rdquo; refer to two different approaches to problem solving. Hard computing, also known as &amp;ldquo;classical computing,&amp;rdquo; refers to the use of traditional, precise algorithms to solve problems.</description>
