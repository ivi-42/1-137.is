<h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>
<p>This introduction story is way more complex and nice than what’s written here, but I went towards a simple beginning. The different beginnings cointans: J. might have not said those words, I might have not said those words, or this never happened.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I was walking in circles and writing poems in the corner of my jeans, when someone approached me, half way from the chair to another circle. I stopped the song (intp leya) to be questioned from the voice of this new soul, called J. and hear one of the 7 cardinal sins:</p>
<p>-Do you know about Sudoku? (or something about it)</p>
<p>With thousands of answers floating in my brain, one comes out from my mount though, and is “yes” (hopefully I said that instead of “i know everything”).</p>
<p>I approached and got shown a weirdly shaped sudoku, written and printed for mass-production of errors and broken hopes. J. wanted to learn how to pay attention (and have fun with Sudokus, but I didn’t really care about that part). And she wanted that 9x9 solved. I immediately understood the importance of the ink printed in those pale flat trees, and I did the thing that I do best. I politely explained:</p>
<p>-J. Do something else, that’s crazy, learn to play an instrument if you want to pay attention, or play being a shepherd dog for chairs.</p>
<p>After explaining my fractured theory of how music can help with logical reasoning, showed a cool musician that I know,  J. was still convinced that Sudoku is the perfect training tool for her needs, or maybe not, I don’t know exactly what was in her head. I was not convinced, and I wanted to argue with her. So I started to think about it, and I come with the idea of writing something about it.</p>
<p>The  interest from J. about Sudokus, how she envisioned it, motivated me more to find a solution to her struggle and why I don’t consider them the best result to learn how to pay attention. I thought to approach the Sudoku that she showed me, and try to find a solution to it, and then, try to find a solution to the problem of Sudoku, and then, try to find a solution to the problem of logic, and then, probably going crazy.</p>
<h1 id="ill-try-to-write-about-it-and-ill-try-to-write-about-it-in-a-way-that-i-can-understand-it-and-maybe-if-im-lucky-someone-else-can-understand-it-too">I’ll try to write about it, and I’ll try to write about it in a way that I can understand it, and maybe, if I’m lucky, someone else can understand it too.</h1>
<p>This is my attempt to solve something without actually solving it, so to later confront J.&rsquo;s way vs my way. One seems to be learning and finding new paths, the other (mine) seems to be analyzing, creating and distructing systems.</p>
<h1 id="sudoku-an-illogic-approach">Sudoku, an illogic approach</h1>
<p>Here I criticize the notion of “logic” or “systematic process” and i’ll attempt to deglorificate it. I’ll analyze the meaning of attention, power of probability, and the stupid thought that it’s better to know than to guess (this, for example comes because J. wanted to know how to solve sudoku, cause she thinks knowing stuff is cool, well, if knowing stuff was cool, J., now I would have been way more famous)</p>
<p>I’ll start from the wikipedia definition of Sudoku, which is referenced as a “logic-based” game.</p>
<p>What is Logic?</p>
<p>Logic it’s a complex word that captures many different meanings depending on who you ask. It is heavily encompassed in some types of philosophy, and for some it’s what distinguishes Humans from other Animals. Thanks to logic, some people could see themselves as more intelligent than a pig as they are not eating whatever someone is throwing at them. Others, can see themselves as more intelligent than poor people, simply thanks to the overcomplex amount of social rules that they need to follow in a dîner de gala. Logic seems used, sometimes, as a way to divide weirdly haired beings from animals, and people from other people.
But let’s put a definition on it, just to agree on common ground, we can’t speak about how it is misused without understanding what’s the scope of it.
Logic is a systematic process that can be expressed in booleans. Pretty stupid, if you think about it, everything answers to logic (or not) even the pig that you throw something at.</p>
<p>I use the pigs, as when I was little I threw a rock.</p>
<p>This rock, to my surprise, was eaten and puked back from a pig, and for each time that it was puked away, another pig approached to do the same thing. It was my first ouroboros. If you think about it, I can express in a “logical” way what the pigs did:</p>
<ol>
<li>-&gt; Is that an object that flies from a person that usually throws food at us? If yes, eat. If not, keep asking yourself why you are there (I guess)</li>
</ol>
<p>So we can see, pigs are logical, but when you think about logic, most of the people don’t think about pigs or animals, they think about humans, or “rationality”.</p>
<p>Wait a second, did I say that everything answers to logic? It is actually “kindish doesish”. Everything answers to logic before, and after. Not in the moment, in the moment logic is, by definition of its systematic approach, not existent. Logic is a process. When it becomes a result, it’s due to it being calculated. Is the calculation always logical? Not really, calculation needs to have a probability for it to be real (and in some cases, effective), less probability you insert in the calculation, harder (or impossible) might become the result. Yes, you can say that for each time I calculate 2 + 2, it will come to 4. But this is not the case, there will always be a probability of it having another number, independently for how little it will be. This notion doesn’t get pushed enough, as it might confuse people, but reality is pretty confusing for Sapiens Sapiens.</p>
<p>My thought is to consider the universe in which I am writing these words, a semi-probabilistic one at its core, or, extremely hard to compute with current technologies. I choose a semi-probabilistic approach, because I do believe probability and determinism exist only where an outcome is uncertain or certain, and as we explore the subatomic world, we are believing that it’s compromised by some probabilistic interest.
This, though, doesn’t neglect another layer of determinism behind this, and even though its existence challenges our notions, it should not be out of the equation.
In other words, logic breaks. And it breaks really often. It breaks in the subatomic world, it breaks in the creation of Strange Matter and it breaks in black holes. But it also breaks into how the universe started. Logic is a constraint, it’s a mere playground of thoughts, and it should not be the final ending (even if, it might be easier to accept logic reasoning, than illogic reasoning, this it’s very easily shown by the amount of people having weird sensations when explaining quantum physics, or when I approach to them).</p>
<h1 id="logic-is-not-a-building-block-of-our-universe">Logic is not a building block of our Universe.</h1>
<p>Okay, now that I barely explained that logic is not the core of this world, let’s imagine that in the sudoku example, the systematic approach is what makes it seductive for some, and  the ability of solving an incognito x with a bunch of triangular lines is cool and makes someone more “observant”.</p>
<h1 id="lets-discuss-the-algorithmic-process-of-solving-a-sudoku">Let’s discuss the algorithmic process of solving a Sudoku.</h1>
<p>A Sudoku puzzle is created, first, by creating the result. Then, the result is broken into 9x9 squares, and then, the squares are broken into 3x3 squares. Then, the 3x3 squares are filled with numbers, and then, the numbers are removed, and then, the numbers are removed in a way that the puzzle can be solved.</p>
<p>There are then, some Sudokus that accepts one and only one solution, and other that have multiple solutions. The first ones are called “unique” and the second ones are called “ambiguous”. Creating an algorithm that never guesses, is not possible in the case of ambiguous puzzles. Considering the Sudoku that I received, it was ambiguous, and it was necessary to guess, even though some guesses are more probable than other, the risk is still there.
Here we can see how the “logic” of the Sudoku (ambiguos) is not really a logic, but a probability. The probability of a number being in a square is not 100%, but it’s not 0% either. It’s a probability, and it’s a probability that can be calculated.</p>
<p>Now, that we divided Sudokus solutions in 2 group, let&rsquo;s see different alghoritms to solve Sudokus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general problem of solving Sudoku puzzles on n2×n2 grids of n×n blocks is known to be NP-complete. Many computer algorithms, such as backtracking and dancing links can solve most 9×9 puzzles efficiently, but combinatorial explosion occurs as n increases, creating limits to the properties of Sudokus that can be constructed, analyzed, and solved as n increases. A Sudoku puzzle can be expressed as a graph coloring problem. The aim is to construct a 9-coloring of a particular graph, given a partial 9-coloring.&rdquo; (from wikipedia)</p>
<p>One is by using Graph Theory, another with backtracking, and another with Dancing Links. There are still many other ways, more or less efficent.</p>
<h1 id="with-graph-theory">With Graph Theory:</h1>
<p>Graph theory concepts can be applied to Sudoku by representing the puzzle as a graph where the vertices are the cells and the edges connect cells in the same row, column, or subgrid.</p>
<p>Here are some specific ways that graph theory concepts can be applied to Sudoku:</p>
<p>Degree of vertices: The degree of a vertex in a Sudoku graph is the number of edges that connect it to other vertices. In a Sudoku graph, each vertex has degree 20, representing the fact that each cell is connected to 20 other cells in the same row, column, and subgrid. By analyzing the degrees of vertices, it is possible to identify cells that have more or fewer possibilities than others, which can help to eliminate possibilities and narrow down the options.</p>
<p>Cliques and independent sets: A clique in a Sudoku graph is a set of vertices that are all connected to each other by edges. An independent set is a set of vertices that are not connected by any edges. By analyzing cliques and independent sets, it is possible to identify cells that must contain certain values or cells that cannot contain certain values.</p>
<p>Coloring: Graph coloring can be used to represent the possible values for each cell in a Sudoku puzzle. Each vertex in the Sudoku graph can be assigned a color that represents a possible value for that cell. If two adjacent vertices have the same color, it means that they cannot both be assigned that value in the solution. By applying graph coloring techniques, it is possible to eliminate possibilities and identify cells that must contain certain values.</p>
<p>Paths and cycles: Paths and cycles in a Sudoku graph can be used to identify cells that must contain certain values or cells that cannot contain certain values. For example, a cycle of length 3 in a row or column indicates that three cells in that row or column must contain three distinct values. By analyzing paths and cycles in the Sudoku graph, it is possible to eliminate possibilities and make progress towards finding the solution.</p>
<p>Graph theory to Sudoku help to identify patterns and relationships between cells that can be used to eliminate possibilities and narrow down the options. However, these techniques may not always be enough to solve a Sudoku puzzle without additional strategies and techniques.</p>
<p>Here a code that uses Graph Theory to visualize the Sudoku:</p>

<h1 id="with-backtracking">With Backtracking:</h1>
<p>Let’s speak about computational complexity:</p>
<p>Computational complexity, can be seen as measure of resources than an alghoritm needs to use in order to solve a problem. The most common measure is time, but it can also be memory, disk space, etc.
Humans, are good in solving computational complexity problems that are extremely hard for computers, such as running, speaking, etc. But, humans are not good in solving computational complexity problems that are extremely easy for computers, such as multiplying 4.2137 at -42.</p>
<p>Another example of an area where humans are really good at, it&rsquo;s protein foldings. In the website fold.it, you can play with proteins, and try to fold them in the best way possible. The problem is that it&rsquo;s a NP-Hard problem, and it&rsquo;s really hard to solve. But, humans are really good at solving NP-Hard problems, and they can solve it better than computers.
<a href="https://fold.it/">https://fold.it/</a> -&gt; NP-Hard problem that humans can solve better than computers. While humans might struggle to multiply 4.2137 at -42.</p>
<h1 id="np-hard-problems">NP-Hard problems:</h1>
<p>When people describe the P vs. NP problem, they often compare the class NP to creativity. They note that composing a Mozart-quality symphony (analogous to an NP task) seems much harder than verifying that an already-composed symphony is Mozart-quality (which is analogous to a P task).</p>
<p>Indeed, NP reminds me more of logic and left-brained thinking than creativity. Proofs, engineering problems, Sudoku puzzles, and other stereotypically &ldquo;left-brained problems&rdquo; are more NP and easy to verify from a quality standpoint than than poetry or music.</p>
<p>NP roughly corresponds to &ldquo;puzzles&rdquo; (viz. the NP-completeness of Sudoku, Minesweeper, Free Cell, etc., when these puzzles are suitably generalized to allow n→∞
). PSPACE corresponds to &ldquo;2-player games&rdquo; (viz. the PSPACE-completeness of chess, go, etc.). This is not news.</p>
<p>People generally seem to do alright with finite instances of NP-complete puzzles, and yet find them non-trivial enough to be entertaining. The finite instances of PSPACE-complete games that we play are considered some of the more difficult intellectual tasks of this type. This at least suggests that PSPACE is &ldquo;hitting the upper limits&rdquo; of our abilities. (Yet our opponents in these PSPACE-complete games are generally other people. Even when the opponents are computers, the computers aren&rsquo;t perfect opponents. This heads towards the question of the power of interactive proofs when the players are computationally limited. There is also the technicality that some generalizations of these games are EXP-complete instead of PSPACE-complete.)</p>
<p>To an extent, the problem sizes that arise in actual puzzles/games have been calibrated to our abilities. 4x4 Sudoku would be too easy, hence boring. 16x16 Sudoku would take too much time (not more than the lifetime of the universe, but more than people are generally willing to sit to solve a Sudoku puzzle). 9x9 seems to be the &ldquo;Goldilocks&rdquo; size for people solving Sudoku. Similarly, playing Free Cell with a deck of 4 suits of 13 cards each and 4 free cells seems to be about the right difficulty to be solvable yet challenging for most people. (On the other hand, one of the smartest people I know is able to solve Free Cell games as though she were just counting natural numbers &ldquo;1,2,3,4,&hellip;&rdquo;) Similarly for the size of Go and Chess boards.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried to compute a 6x6 permanent by hand?</p>
<p>I suppose the point is that if you take natural problems in classes significantly above PSPACE (or EXP), then the only finite instances that people are capable of solving seem to be so small as to be un-interesting. Part of the reason &ldquo;natural&rdquo; is necessary here is that one can take a natural problem, then &ldquo;unnaturally&rdquo; modify all instances of size &lt;1010
so that for all instances a human would ever try the problem becomes totally intractible, regardless of its asymptotic complexity.</p>
<p>Conversely, for problems in EXP, any problem size below the &ldquo;heel of the exponential&rdquo; has a chance of being solvable by most people in reasonable amounts of time.</p>
<p>As to the rest of PH, there aren&rsquo;t many (any?) natural games people play with a fixed number of rounds. This is also somehow related to the fact that we don&rsquo;t know of many natural problems complete for levels of PH above the third.</p>
<p>As mentioned by Serge, FPT has a role to play here, but (I think) mostly in the fact that some problems naturally have more than one &ldquo;input size&rdquo; associated with them.</p>
<p>Use of randomness in Polynomial-time approximation scheme. There are 2 type of approximation scheme for NP hard problems, deterministic and randomized</p>
<p>Let’s dig into the math a bit more. “Hardness” is a family of ideas about comparisons between problems based on reusability of algorithmic solutions. Loosely speaking, a problem  is hard with respect to a class of problems  if an algorithm solving  can be easily transformed into an algorithm solving any problem in . You have to say what kinds of transformations are allowed, and the transformation can be different for different target problems in , but that’s the basic idea.In the Super Mario example, if you want to solve logical formulas, you can transform a hypothetically perfect mario-level-playing algorithm into a logic solver by encoding the formula as a level and running the mario-level-playing algorithm on it as a black box. Add an if statement to the end to translate “level can/can’t be finished” to “formula can/can’t be satisfied,” and the transformation is complete. It’s important for NP-hardness that the transformation only takes polynomial time. Other kinds of hardness might admit more or restrict to fewer resources.
And so this is what makes Mario NP-hard, because boolean logic satisfiability is NP-hard. Any problem in NP can be solved by a boolean logic solver, and hence also by a mario-level-player. The fact that boolean logic solving is NP-hard is a difficult theorem to prove. But if we assume it’s true, you can compose the transformations to get from any NP problem to Super Mario.
Sudoku is another example of a problem that can be related to computational complexity. It has been shown that solving a Sudoku puzzle is an NP-complete problem. This means that it is at least as hard as the hardest problems in the class NP, and if a polynomial-time algorithm for solving Sudoku were found, it would imply that P = NP. However, just like with the Super Mario example, the general hardness of Sudoku doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate to the difficulty of solving individual puzzles. Sudoku puzzles come in various sizes and difficulty levels. The most common Sudoku puzzles have a 9x9 grid and are designed to be solvable by humans using logical deduction. There are efficient algorithms and heuristics that can solve these puzzles quickly, as well as more complex ones. In practice, the difficulty of Sudoku puzzles for humans and the complexity of solving them algorithmically are not directly correlated. Humans are generally good at pattern recognition and can apply logical reasoning to solve moderately difficult Sudoku puzzles, whereas computers can solve even the most complex Sudoku puzzles efficiently through brute-force search or other algorithmic techniques. So, while Sudoku is an NP-complete problem in its general form, this complexity does not prevent humans or algorithms from solving real-world instances of the problem. This demonstrates that the theoretical complexity of a problem does not always dictate its difficulty in practice, and that heuristic or specialized approaches can be effective for solving instances of hard problems.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For linear systems of equations there is Gaussian elimination which transforms a system of linear equations into a standard representation. In the case of linear equations, this normal form is a triangular matrix. For systems of polynomial equations there is also a normal form, called the Gröbner basis. And there is Buchberger’s algorithm which can compute a Gröbner basis. In a very real sense Buchberger’s algorithm is a generalization of Gaussian elimination and in the case of linear equations those two algorithms are equal. So, in summary we can use Buchberger’s algorithm to compute a Gröbner basis of the equations and then read off the solution to the sudoku.</p>

<p>Abstraction as a form of attention:</p>
<p>How abstraction, and solve one for many relation, could create a formula for a better attention. Solving sudokus is learning how to solve one to one, and later one to more, and endly, one to many. This progress is what makes someone a “champion”. The ability to solve multiple problems with one formula.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s not a rule. Some Sudokus can indeed be solved using only deterministic methods, while others require some degree of guessing and backtracking. In general, the harder the Sudoku is, the more likely it is that guessing and backtracking will be necessary to find the solution. There are some advanced solving techniques that involve more complex logical deductions than the basic ones we mentioned earlier. For example, one such technique is called &ldquo;XY-wing&rdquo; and involves looking for certain patterns of numbers that can only appear in a specific way, which can lead to the deduction of new values for other cells. However, these advanced techniques can be quite difficult to apply and may not be enough to solve the most challenging Sudokus without resorting to guessing and backtracking.</p>
