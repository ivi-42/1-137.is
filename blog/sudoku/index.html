    <h1 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h1>
<p>This introduction story is way more complex and nice than what’s written here, but I went towards a simple beginning. The different beginnings cointans: J. might have not said those words, I might have not said those words, or this never happened.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I was walking in circles and writing poems in the corner of my jeans, when someone approached me, half way from the chair to another circle. I stopped the song (intp leya) to be questioned from the voice of this new soul, called J. and hear one of the 7 cardinal sins:</p>
<p>-Do you know about Sudoku? (or something about it)</p>
<p>With thousands of answers floating in my brain, one comes out from my mount though, and is “yes” (hopefully I said that instead of “i know everything”).</p>
<p>I approached and got shown a weirdly shaped sudoku, written and printed for mass-production of errors and broken hopes. J. wanted to learn how to pay attention (and have fun with Sudokus, but I didn’t really care about that part). And she wanted that 9x9 solved. I immediately understood the importance of the ink printed in those pale flat trees, and I did the thing that I do best. I politely explained:</p>
<p>-J. Do something else, that’s crazy, learn to play an instrument if you want to pay attention, or play being a shepherd dog for chairs.</p>
<p>After explaining my fractured theory of how music can help with logical reasoning, showed a cool musician that I know,  J. was still convinced that Sudoku is the perfect training tool for her needs, or maybe not, I don’t know exactly what was in her head. I was not convinced, and I wanted to argue with her. So I started to think about it, and I come with the idea of writing something about it.</p>
<p>The  interest from J. about Sudokus, how she envisioned it, motivated me more to find a solution to her struggle and why I don’t consider them the best result to learn how to pay attention. I thought to approach the Sudoku that she showed me, and try to find a solution to it, and then, try to find a solution to the problem of Sudoku, and then, try to find a solution to the problem of logic, and then, probably going crazy.</p>
<h1 id="ill-try-to-write-about-it-and-ill-try-to-write-about-it-in-a-way-that-i-can-understand-it-and-maybe-if-im-lucky-someone-else-can-understand-it-too">I’ll try to write about it, and I’ll try to write about it in a way that I can understand it, and maybe, if I’m lucky, someone else can understand it too.</h1>
<p>This is my attempt to solve something without actually solving it, so to later confront J.&rsquo;s way vs my way. One seems to be learning and finding new paths, the other (mine) seems to be analyzing, creating and distructing systems.</p>
<h1 id="sudoku-an-illogic-approach">Sudoku, an illogic approach</h1>
<p>Here I criticize the notion of “logic” or “systematic process” and i’ll attempt to deglorificate it. I’ll analyze the meaning of attention, power of probability, and the stupid thought that it’s better to know than to guess (this, for example comes because J. wanted to know how to solve sudoku, cause she thinks knowing stuff is cool, well, if knowing stuff was cool, J., now I would have been way more famous)</p>
<p>I’ll start from the wikipedia definition of Sudoku, which is referenced as a “logic-based” game.</p>
<p>What is Logic?</p>
<p>Logic it’s a complex word that captures many different meanings depending on who you ask. It is heavily encompassed in some types of philosophy, and for some it’s what distinguishes Humans from other Animals. Thanks to logic, some people could see themselves as more intelligent than a pig as they are not eating whatever someone is throwing at them. Others, can see themselves as more intelligent than poor people, simply thanks to the overcomplex amount of social rules that they need to follow in a dîner de gala. Logic seems used, sometimes, as a way to divide weirdly haired beings from animals, and people from other people.
But let’s put a definition on it, just to agree on common ground, we can’t speak about how it is misused without understanding what’s the scope of it.
Logic is a systematic process that can be expressed in booleans. Pretty stupid, if you think about it, everything answers to logic (or not) even the pig that you throw something at.</p>
<p>I use the pigs, as when I was little I threw a rock.</p>
<p>This rock, to my surprise, was eaten and puked back from a pig, and for each time that it was puked away, another pig approached to do the same thing. It was my first ouroboros. If you think about it, I can express in a “logical” way what the pigs did:</p>
<ol>
<li>-&gt; Is that an object that flies from a person that usually throws food at us? If yes, eat. If not, keep asking yourself why you are there (I guess)</li>
</ol>
<p>So we can see, pigs are logical, but when you think about logic, most of the people don’t think about pigs or animals, they think about humans, or “rationality”.</p>
<p>Wait a second, did I say that everything answers to logic? It is actually “kindish doesish”. Everything answers to logic before, and after. Not in the moment, in the moment logic is, by definition of its systematic approach, not existent. Logic is a process. When it becomes a result, it’s due to it being calculated. Is the calculation always logical? Not really, calculation needs to have a probability for it to be real (and in some cases, effective), less probability you insert in the calculation, harder (or impossible) might become the result. Yes, you can say that for each time I calculate 2 + 2, it will come to 4. But this is not the case, there will always be a probability of it having another number, independently for how little it will be. This notion doesn’t get pushed enough, as it might confuse people, but reality is pretty confusing for Sapiens Sapiens.</p>
<p>My thought is to consider the universe in which I am writing these words, a semi-probabilistic one at its core, or, extremely hard to compute with current technologies. I choose a semi-probabilistic approach, because I do believe probability and determinism exist only where an outcome is uncertain or certain, and as we explore the subatomic world, we are believing that it’s compromised by some probabilistic interest.
This, though, doesn’t neglect another layer of determinism behind this, and even though its existence challenges our notions, it should not be out of the equation.
In other words, logic breaks. And it breaks really often. It breaks in the subatomic world, it breaks in the creation of Strange Matter and it breaks in black holes. But it also breaks into how the universe started. Logic is a constraint, it’s a mere playground of thoughts, and it should not be the final ending (even if, it might be easier to accept logic reasoning, than illogic reasoning, this it’s very easily shown by the amount of people having weird sensations when explaining quantum physics, or when I approach to them).</p>
<p>Ending: Logic is not a building block of our Universe.</p>
<p>Okay, now that I barely explained that logic is not the core of this world, let’s imagine that in the sudoku example, the systematic approach is what makes it seductive for some, and  the ability of solving an incognito x with a bunch of triangular lines is cool and makes someone more “observant”.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss the algorithmic process of solving a Sudoku.</p>
<p>A Sudoku puzzle is created, first, by creating the result, this will .
Having a deterministic approach where algorithms never guess, is not always possible in the case where a puzzle has multiple solutions.</p>
<p>In sudoku, logic formulas are linked to the problem, and finding those logical formulas is more similar to travel back in time, or finding conditions to make the logic that was established true.</p>
<p>Let’s speak about computational complexity:</p>
<p><a href="https://fold.it/">https://fold.it/</a> -&gt; NP-Hard problem that humans can solve better than computers. While humans might struggle to multiply 4.2137 at -42</p>
<p>Use of randomness in Polynomial-time approximation scheme. There are 2 type of approximation scheme for NP hard problems, deterministic and randomized</p>
<p>Let’s dig into the math a bit more. “Hardness” is a family of ideas about comparisons between problems based on reusability of algorithmic solutions. Loosely speaking, a problem  is hard with respect to a class of problems  if an algorithm solving  can be easily transformed into an algorithm solving any problem in . You have to say what kinds of transformations are allowed, and the transformation can be different for different target problems in , but that’s the basic idea.In the Super Mario example, if you want to solve logical formulas, you can transform a hypothetically perfect mario-level-playing algorithm into a logic solver by encoding the formula as a level and running the mario-level-playing algorithm on it as a black box. Add an if statement to the end to translate “level can/can’t be finished” to “formula can/can’t be satisfied,” and the transformation is complete. It’s important for NP-hardness that the transformation only takes polynomial time. Other kinds of hardness might admit more or restrict to fewer resources.
And so this is what makes Mario NP-hard, because boolean logic satisfiability is NP-hard. Any problem in NP can be solved by a boolean logic solver, and hence also by a mario-level-player. The fact that boolean logic solving is NP-hard is a difficult theorem to prove. But if we assume it’s true, you can compose the transformations to get from any NP problem to Super Mario.
Sudoku is another example of a problem that can be related to computational complexity. It has been shown that solving a Sudoku puzzle is an NP-complete problem. This means that it is at least as hard as the hardest problems in the class NP, and if a polynomial-time algorithm for solving Sudoku were found, it would imply that P = NP. However, just like with the Super Mario example, the general hardness of Sudoku doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate to the difficulty of solving individual puzzles. Sudoku puzzles come in various sizes and difficulty levels. The most common Sudoku puzzles have a 9x9 grid and are designed to be solvable by humans using logical deduction. There are efficient algorithms and heuristics that can solve these puzzles quickly, as well as more complex ones. In practice, the difficulty of Sudoku puzzles for humans and the complexity of solving them algorithmically are not directly correlated. Humans are generally good at pattern recognition and can apply logical reasoning to solve moderately difficult Sudoku puzzles, whereas computers can solve even the most complex Sudoku puzzles efficiently through brute-force search or other algorithmic techniques. So, while Sudoku is an NP-complete problem in its general form, this complexity does not prevent humans or algorithms from solving real-world instances of the problem. This demonstrates that the theoretical complexity of a problem does not always dictate its difficulty in practice, and that heuristic or specialized approaches can be effective for solving instances of hard problems.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For linear systems of equations there is Gaussian elimination which transforms a system of linear equations into a standard representation. In the case of linear equations, this normal form is a triangular matrix. For systems of polynomial equations there is also a normal form, called the Gröbner basis. And there is Buchberger’s algorithm which can compute a Gröbner basis. In a very real sense Buchberger’s algorithm is a generalization of Gaussian elimination and in the case of linear equations those two algorithms are equal. So, in summary we can use Buchberger’s algorithm to compute a Gröbner basis of the equations and then read off the solution to the sudoku.</p>

<p>Abstraction as a form of attention:</p>
<p>How abstraction, and solve one for many relation, could create a formula for a better attention. Solving sudokus is learning how to solve one to one, and later one to more, and endly, one to many. This progress is what makes someone a “champion”. The ability to solve multiple problems with one formula.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s not a rule. Some Sudokus can indeed be solved using only deterministic methods, while others require some degree of guessing and backtracking. In general, the harder the Sudoku is, the more likely it is that guessing and backtracking will be necessary to find the solution. There are some advanced solving techniques that involve more complex logical deductions than the basic ones we mentioned earlier. For example, one such technique is called &ldquo;XY-wing&rdquo; and involves looking for certain patterns of numbers that can only appear in a specific way, which can lead to the deduction of new values for other cells. However, these advanced techniques can be quite difficult to apply and may not be enough to solve the most challenging Sudokus without resorting to guessing and backtracking.</p>
