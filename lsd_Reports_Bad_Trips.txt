The first rinsing resulted in a noticable and strong taste. I probably should have stopped right then and there, but I didn't. I rinsed out the other 3. Within 10 minutes, I was feeling the effects. Ten minutes! Within 30 minutes, I was trembling and beginning to fear I may have overdone it. There was a crowd of people around and we were preparing to go on an outing, waiting on the last few people to getready. At 45 minutes, I wasn't sure I was even going to be able to go. At 1 hour we piled into cars and headed off. Fifty minutes of riding shotgun with Moby blaring and my head about to explode left me reeling. I was  scared, plain and simple, and that's something I'd never experienced on acid with such force and tenacity. In over 300 experiences with LSD, at no time had I felt so meaningless and helpless or even a hint at the  darkness stalking my thoughts at the time. Having had several experiencesat around the 800mcg dose, I would estimate my dose that day at 1-1.5mg. Yes, milli, not micro.We piled out of the cars and encountered another group of people, one of whom had a yappy little dog. I just could *not* deal and yet had no idea of how to get away.As soon as we were away from the cars, I pulled Y aside and we ran  backcountry up the mountain (*NOTE* this is a mountain I know well. I do *not* recommend charging off the trail while psychonavigating without knowing the area intimately). I very much needed to race thru the woods, away from people, breathing good air, and sharing a sacred place. The rest of the group finally met up with us at the summit. I rested and became absorbed in my own thoughts. Thoughts of having spent high school nights just sitting and meditating on the very rocks we were now on. Thoughts of friends who've come and gone; what makes a friend worth keeping, worth making an effort to maintain the friendship for years and years? Why do these people bother with me? These rocks have known many, many people. Does it matter that any of us are here now?I started getting agitated over nothing and everything. I had peaked on the peak and now, riding home down off the mountain was a physical analogy of what was happening in my mind. I was coming down and sinking in. Very little was said on the way home. By the time we got there, I was in a exageratedly negative frame of mind. I retired to the bedroom and sulked. Within minutes all of my energies seemed to be turned into sadness and I could do nothing but sob. For over a half an hour I cried uncontrollably, screaming into my pillow and terrified by my own thoughts.Jetsam was with me almost the entire time and her presence was a blessing.  After almost an hour away from everyone, I started to regain my composure. I knew that the overall group vibe was high and in good spirits and that  Jetsam wanted to let loose that night. To that end, I didn't want to be a stick-in-the-mud in the mood I was in and agreed we'd both do MDMA. While I hinted at wanting us to stay close together that night due to my sense of fragility, I didn't make it unquestionably clear. I ate lightly and then popped 75mg to start. About an hour and a half after taking it, I was feeling something, but very light. Jetsam *didn't* stay close; in fact, she deliberately escaped my dark presence as often as she could and pushed her own envelope of consumption, nekkidness, and interpersonal relationships. A few things happened which took my already squished ego and put it in a blender. My head was spinning. I felt like I was sinking fast in quicksand and everyone around me was standing on the bank laughing and dancing and no one was trying to help me out. I kept moving from room to room but found solace nowhere. My very soulmate seemed to have lost all contact with my soul. Thoughts were bubbling over one another faster than I could process them, until one stuck: do enough MDMA to not care and to erase further memory of the evening. So I swallowed another 125mg (anything over 150 generally disrupts my memory). It worked. I don't remember many details of the rest of the night. I remember events and little snippets, exceptionally special moments and horrifyingly dark ones, but putting them together sequentially and meaningfully is perplexing. I do remember continuing to boost with 50mg insuffilated every 90 minutes or so at least 3 times. The rush and quick onset of this method of delivery was inspiring!Dawn found me alone, as it often does. Lots of time to contemplate it all, to try to digest it without spinning right back into it. I never slept that day.It took me over 2 weeks to process that zoom enough that my palms didn't sweat and I didn't get the shakes while talking about it. I'm typing this up 2 months later and I still get jittery thinking about it. Some of the music from that afternoon and evening instantly agitates me within the first 2 measures. I wonder how long it will take to fade.Epilogue:   * Don't keep chugging unknown quantities of substances... work up slowly.   * When you do enter the darkness, _clearly_ (as possible) indicate to  another person where you are.   * If someone tells you they're having trouble, respect it and assume that they're probably in a worse spot than they're letting on.   * There is such a thing as too much.Be careful out there.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 1842Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 14, 2000Views: 37,495    Pharms - Bupropion (87), MDMA (3), LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), Combinations (3), General (1) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)This is a report on the first time I had a really unpleasant experience with psychedelics. Since that experience, I have had a few others that were 'bad' in one sense or another, but nothing quite like the gut wrenching terror of this experience. This occurred fairly early in my tripping career. I was 18 years old, just out of high school. It was approximately one year after my first trip. I had tripped approximately 15-20 times over the course of that year, and thought I knew what I was doing. I was very overconfident. It started off normally enough. A friend called and said she could get me some acid. I went to see her and bought enough for myself and my companions. She told me it was very good stuff, and mentioned a couple of people had flipped out on it. I was unconcerned. I returned home and took two hits. My friends likewise ingested theirs. One girl, a good friend of mine and one of my roommate's girlfriend (we'll call her S) was trying LSD for the first time. Immediately after ingestion, I left to give my brother a ride to the place he was staying. After dropping him off I went to a convenience store nearby to get a beverage. As soon as I walked in I realized I was feeling the acid. This was maybe T+20 minutes. Already things were beginning to undulate and move. A sign for chili looked alive. I grabbed what I was there for and got the hell out of there. The ride home was interesting. It started to rain and I was starting to trip harder. I was a little tense to be driving while tripping but I made it home safely. When I got inside, my roommates were watching the end of Brazil. I sat down and watched the rest of it with them, even though I hadn't seen much of the beginning or middle. This was a mistake. If you have ever seen Brazil, you know exactly what I mean. The end of this movie is very dark, very surreal, and very disturbing. Anyone who knows anything about set and setting would realize that was not the best thing to be watching as a powerful acid trip came on... After the movie we sat around and listened to music. I was really tripping, probably as hard as I had ever tripped before. The posters on the wall were breathing and crawling out over their normal boundaries. S was running around like most first timers, going off about everything. About this time, two girls, A and B, showed up. They asked if anyone wanted to go hang out with them. B was an exgirlfriend of mine. One of my roommates, E, and I decided to go with them. This was my second mistake. We drove around town looking for 'something to do' (a party). We ended up at another friend of mine's house. There were several people there drinking beer and one or two who were tripping as well. We went in and sat down to hang out. There were many people around. I started to get confused as to what was going on around me. In fact, little or nothing was going on, but I was being overwhelmed by the presence of so many people. B left to go get someone or something and M (a friend of both of ours) decided to play a little joke on me. He told me (at least I think he did, I was pretty tripped out!) that B had taken some LSD. This shocked me, since she had always been uninterested in it before. He also told me she wanted to rekindle things with me. Why he told me these things I do not know. Perhaps he thought it would be funny. I think he was tripping as well, so maybe he was just going off on some weird head noise of his own. In any case, it severely fractured my already tenuous grip on reality. I was suddenly very worried about B. I thought she had just taken her first hit of LSD, and I knew she shouldn't be out driving if she had. I started to have all these visions of dying, car wrecks, etc. My mind flashed back to my experience earlier in the evening, driving as the acid started to work. In short, I had myself worked up pretty well by the time she returned. When she came back, I quickly pulled her into another room to talk. I started asking her about her trip, if she really wanted to get back together, etc. She was looking at me like I was a total nut. She was fairly inexperienced with dealing with trippers. She tried to straighten me out, but I seemed unable to process anything she was saying. I was just getting more and more tense and confused. She was able to convince me that she wasn't interested in rekindling and that she hadn't taken any LSD. This took her the better part of an hour, and in that time I somehow convinced myself I was in mortal peril. I was convinced I was dying. I was totally adrift. I had no idea what was real. I was peaking on a good dose of LSD, and everyone was just confusing the hell out of me. To be fair, I don't think anyone realized I was losing it until it was too late.One of the guys there who was drinking was screwing around with a screwdriver, pretending to stab himself with it. This seemed unbearably gruesome to me. All my thoughts centered on death. I felt like I was in the middle of a psychedelic hurricane with no way out. I sat down in the corner and closed my eyes. It was the only thing I could think of to do. People continued to try and talk to me, but I ignored them. I heard someone come in, and decided to open my eyes. And what did I see? A giant snake crawling right towards me and my roommate leaving with my ride. My roommate was deathly afraid of snakes, which is why he left. The neighbors had brought over a bull snake to show us. The guy who it belonged to had thought it would be funny to let it go so it would crawl over to me. I just thought that was the final straw. At this point, my mind overloaded and shut down. I just don't know what occurred for the next few hours. I remember a very few things, and I am still not sure what is real and what I hallucinated. I know I kicked everyone out and locked the door. Keep in mind, this wasn't my house I was kicking everyone out of. I did insist that one of my friends, P, stay with me. I wouldn't talk to him, but I wouldn't let him leave either. At some point, he snuck out (I don't blame him. I was probably scaring the hell out of him). I spent the next few hours in hell. I was certain I was dying, or had already died. I kept thinking about heaven and hell, and lots of Christian religious themes. I was raised Christian, but had rejected it long ago. Not as fully as I had presumed, apparently. I was certain that since I was not 'good' as the churches of the Christian world defined it, I must be 'evil'. I went through hours of agony and terror. At some point, I apparently pissed my pants in fear. People came by looking for the guy that lived there. I refused to talk to them, or even acknowledge their existence. I thought they were illusions. After a while, I started to reform my ego. The reality map I came back with was extremely bent, however. I was convinced I was in some kind of Limbo, waiting to die fully. I thought when I ran out of cigarettes, I would simply cease to be. At this point, the idea didn't frighten me any longer. Death would have been a relief. The thought crossed my mind that maybe I was supposed to do some symbolic suicide to move on, and I looked for a gun or knife to do it with. Luckily, there was nothing like that present. One of the guys (the one who had been mock stabbing himself) came down to check on me. I let him in, but wouldn't talk to him much. I was convinced he was some sort of demon who looked like my friend. He talked me into coming next door where everyone was waiting. The scene over there was normal, but it seemed very bizarre to me. I was convinced everyone there was a demon replica of themselves. Their actions seemed inexplicable. Now I realize that it was my mindset that was screwy, but then it seemed the world was replaced with a dark mirror version. We sat around while I tried to make sense of what had just occurred. I was still extremely uneasy. I thought I was down, but I am certain now I wasn't. My friend M had flies buzzing around his head, and I swear I saw one fly into his open mouth and crawl out of his nose. This obviously didn't do much for my state of mind. An hour or so later, my roommate came and picked me up. Actually, most everyone who was still there piled into his VW Bug and drove over to my house to watch a movie. 11 people in a VW, and I know that wasn't a hallucination. When I got home I went and sat in the shower for close to an hour with all my clothes on, trying to figure out what had happened and what was real. Afterwards I felt better, but not all together. I was tempted to quit using psychedelics altogether, but something told me I had to go back at least one more time. At the time, this was the most frightening and unpleasant experience of my life. It is still the worst trip I have ever taken. I realize now that my set and setting were awful, and that I was asking for a bad trip. At that time, I used psychedelics very casually, for recreational purposes. I didn't take any of the insights I gleaned from them very seriously. I was young and had a lot of emotional problems, most of which weren't worked out until years later. In short, I was the perfect candidate for a bad trip. My next few trips were pretty mellow. I did have a few more unpleasant experiences that year, which led to my stopping usage for close to a year and a half. This trip had some profound effects on my life. It caused me to take everything a bit more seriously. I think that if I had had the courage to really face some of the things that had come up, I would have gained more from it. Instead, I chose to run away and stop tripping for a while. I chose to put this experience here as a warning to novice explorers that psychedelics aren't always fun and beautiful. Sometimes trips can be horrifying and ugly. However, those trips tend to show you where you really need to work, if you have the strength to face the issues they bring up. I hope that someone can learn from my bad experience, and possibly avoid one of their own.

I was staying on the sixth floor of a hotel overlooking the boardwalk. Every night was a party beer, smoke, ecstasy, and acid. I had tripped four previous times so I knew what it was about, and how it worked, but I never tripped alone before or in an unfamiliar place and that’s where I went wrong. One night we all got tabs, and planned to trip the next evening, but while me and my friend were cutting them up one of the tabs shot out from the scissors and landed directly in a drop of water at the bottom of the sink. I knew it was surely ruined if I didn't take it immediately, so like the idiot that I was I popped it in my mouth without thinking. About twenty minutes later we were passing a bowl of some of the best hydro I have ever seen on the balcony overlooking the boardwalk. I had thirds, I lit up the lighter took a very big inhale and before I took the bowl out of my mouth I was tripping my nuts off, not to mention the fact I was already drunk and very high. I was having the best time at first though I was the only one tripping. Till about two A.M. everyone was up, but then one by one people were leaving and falling asleep, and since I was the only one tripping I was completely awake. As the night wound down the trip got worse and worse as more people left the balcony, until I was the only one left. I knew it was coming and now that I was by myself it was there. The bad trip had overcome me. I tried to fight it every way possible music, cigarettes (I went through three packs in about six hours), and sleep but nothing worked. Everything that can go wrong went wrong. I was having the most horrible visual trip. The sand on the beach showed me the craziest things overlooking it from about six stories. Not to mention the ocean, all the lights around the boardwalk, the heat lightning storm that crept up on me, the crazy looking crack heads and drunks lingering around the boardwalk all hours of the night, and the eerie setting of the balcony with kept appearing to be a mouth only seconds away from swallowing me. Not to mention the visual part the audio part was almost as worse. I was picking up sounds from everywhere. At one point I kept hearing all of these very loud cricket noises, I looked over the balcony and there was a row of bushes, I looked hard and the crickets were racing out of the bushes up the building and right onto my balcony. I jumped up onto my lawn chair and screamed, I looked harder and they all disappeared. I continuously tried to calm myself down and succeeded but of course it didn't last long as the bad trip slowly crept back into my mind. Around six I tried to sleep but it just kept getting worse and worse. I would keep calming myself down, but as soon as I did, not seconds later it was back. In bed I was seeing everything as scary as possible. The wallpaper was getting crazier and crazier and the blankets on my bed in the hotel kept making all of these waving motions almost as something was slowly creeping up on me from under the covers. I could not take it anymore I wanted it to go away more than anything I have ever wanted in my life. I went back out on the balcony and continued my bad trip as it took eons to go away. Eventually it did almost simultaneously with the most beautiful sunrise I have ever seen. At the time I believe I got a preview of heaven with amazing sun and green appearing ocean. After that I very quickly became drowsier and drowsier until I was definitely ready for bed. By this time it was a little after nine A.M. I went in and practically immediately passed out and slept until about 2:30 P.M. It was over and I was happy. I hope my frightening account, as hard as it was to write, has warned you of the psychological craziness of LSD and next time you do it be very careful about your surroundings and never trip alone.

Exp Year: ExpID: 1999Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 21, 2000Views: 8,030    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Unknown Context (20) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)The trip began at 12:00 P.M. with 1 hit of blotter paper (I have since realized that I have an incredibly low tolerance for psychedelics). I was over at a friend of mine's house. My friend (now former friend), we'll call her K. also took one hit. We both drank a huge glass of orange juice (Vitamin C supposedly potentiates LSD, although I have read nothing on this subject, so I don't know if it's just a rumor). We were watching movies and the first thing I noticed was a slight increase in color and the fact that K's cigarette had little fire balls following it when she moved it (trails). Nothing much happened for the next 6 hours, when K's friend called to ask if we wanted to come get some marijuana with him. I didn't want to leave because I didn't know if something would happen since we were tripping, but K insisted. K's friend arrived at about 6:00 P.M. and we left with him and some of his friends to get the pot. After we got it we smoked a couple o hits in the car and we headed back home. All of a sudden I felt overwhelmed by something, I flew out of my own body and out the back of the car and I could see myself in a way weirder than an out-of-body because I could see my body in the car and I could see my soul floating above the car all from a different perspective. Everything shifted into cartoon form and looked very fucked up, everything became 2-D and flat. The part of me that was floating above the car changed form so it's now 2-D face grew a zig-zag mustache and one of its eyes became a spinning spiral while the other became a flickering eye of horus, which shot occult symbols out (the symbols were constantly floating around the head). Then the soul's head began spinning and turned into a top on which there were various changing 2-D cartoon faces all with the mustache, eyes, etc. Finaly the face stayed the same, it was the face of my father!(By the way, the other part of me, my body, could be seen in the distance screaming and thrashing about waving its hands about thrashing away strange things which flew around its head). Then a strange 'electrical tornado' crashed down upon the 'top' head. Both bodies crumbled to dust and blew away. My position then shifted so I could see out of every dust particle. The particles then spread throughout the universe and absorbed into everything. I have had near death experiences before and this was exactly the same as the others. I existed in everything simultaneously yet I did not exist myself. I could only experience, I could not act. I then suddenly flashed into a somewhat concensus reality only this reality was just as messed up as what I just experienced. I just sat there in a movie theater wondering why I was watching this stupid movie of some people sitting in a car. Then I realized I was supposed to be in the car !!!!!! I tried to force my self back to reality and was some what successful (I would periodically shift back to movie theater vision). When I finally managed to understand what was going on in the car I heard the driver saying 'I have seen people on ten hits of acid and I have never seen anyone that fucked up before.' I tried to tell everyone what just happened and I couldn't manage to articulate my words enough to do so. I had no idea where I was except that I was in a car, I was scared I thought I would either die or go insane forever. I remember one thought going through my head continuously 'I am the biggest lunatic alive. People will charge admission to see me. My parents will feel I am a disgrace and disown me. All because I know the meaning of it all but cannot explain it.' The strange thing about this thought was that I was not consciously thinking it and yet it was running through my head so clearly I could hear it.When we got back to K's house her parents asked if I was hungry. I felt sick. My heart was racing so fast I could hear it. I stammered an answer and K pulled me upstairs. I told her I was not okay and I fell to the floor of her room. She ran downstairs to get her parents. Suddenly I felt completely fine and ran to catch up with K. She was telling her parents I was ODing and was going to die. I yelled that I was OK, but no one heard me!? Then K and her parents ran upstairs ... right through me. 'Oh Shit', I thought 'I was dead.' I ran after them and saw my own body on the ground completely still. Then I realized that I hadn't been breathing and had no pulse the entire time I was downstairs. Just as I made the realization I snapped back into my body and told them I had just died and become a ghost. They took me to the hospital and to make a long story short, the doctors did nothing except laugh at me and take blood samples.My parents came and picked me up. The only hallucinations I had in the hospital were posters being written in Japanese, Jesus on a cross on a wall talking to me in jibberish, a giant washing machine floating in the middle of the room, out of body experiences (especially when vomitting which occured about 6 times), things becoming cartoon like (again especially while vomitting). Closed eye visuals were so elaborate it is hard to explain them, all of them were 3-D and most of them were 1960's images smiley faces, peace signs, grateful dead bears, etc. or naked people melting together and growing weird limbs and bodily structures all while having intercourse (Note: I didn't close my eyes much because I felt I couldn't open them if I did). That's all folks. Take it for what it's worth, I figure either my tolerance for LSD is extremely low, the pot was laced with something or both. I have also had flashbacks, trails, and mild ego disolution since then. Either way LSD is definitely not getting my recommendation !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Exp Year: 1999ExpID: 2000Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 21, 2000Views: 182,296    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Unknown Context (20) DOSE:3 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)Ok,this is something that affects me till this day. I was 19 years old at the time I had a very bad acid trip that seemed to posess supernatural powers,something very very evil I might add. this happened 8 years ago and I remember it like it was a few weeks ago..One day, after a morning of smoking rock-cocaine and taking addipex (what a nasty combination !), a friend calls me up and tell me that he had some really potent acid for sale.I was a big-time acid fiend and I was used to doing heavy-duty tripping. anyway, I told him to hold me 3 hits and I would be by later to pick it up. I didn't go over to get the acid until I was somewhat over the horrible feeling when you run out of coke or rock. I was still speeding (if you call addipex speed, i call it trash) from the addipex. I think I ate 2 addipexes that day. ok anyway that afternoon around 5 pm I got the acid and I remember how excited I was to take it because it had an elephant on the hit, it was more red than pink but it was referred to as pink elephant. the hits where still moist, saturated with LSD. I remember wondering if he might have licked my stuff, but I knew he wasn't a acid head. so I thought I would be a badass and take all three hits, even though he told me I wouldn't need more than one. well I took 3 hits under my tongue. they where still joined together as stamps, and I kept them under my tongue for a long time before grinding em up an dissolving it in my mouth. The acid came on slow at first. the first hour I felt the typical acid come on buzz. it wasn't until 3 hours after taking 3 hits of this stuff that things started to get really intense an almost scary. all I know is I ended up at a friend's ( a female) who lived close by my house( I was still doing the driving at this point). well while I was over there at her house we were on her screen porch and she has a couple birds that where in a cage...there was a picture on the wall of an angel and she appeared to be flying directly at me and I was commenting to the girl about it an laughig my ass off. things started to get really freaky,it was almost the 3 hour mark and I remember being so freaked out by the birds an the noises they made that I was ready to leave. I felt an overwhelming rush and my skin looked as though I had millions of intense patterns on it.before I left (this is what caused me also to leave)her mom came and said hello and I thought I was still talking to the girl I was visiting so there I was telling her mom that I was seeing the angel flying all over the room. the girl had to tell her mom I was tripping (her mom was 'cool'). anyway, i left and drove about 2 blocks to another friend's house and he wasn't doing anything that night( he also had stopped doing acid) so I asked him if he would drive for me because I was really starting to trip. he agreed to go with me so off we went to a bar. I said I wanted to go to play poll of all things to do tripping. well we get to this old biker bar and there was a big party going on and hundreds of people but we managed to get the only table there was!! well that is when the acid started to tell me that this was not an ordinary trip..i started to hear noises, the bar started shaking,a little at first then it got violent..as it was shaking I could also hear bottles being hit together as if there was an earthquake an the bottles we hitting against each other. it still wasn't scared,i just felt really funny because not only was the bar an all shaking but it felt like the bottom half of my body was shaking. it felt so strange I asked my friend to leave with me an go outside. when we got outside it got worse so I asked him to drive me to a store to get a beer(even though we where at a bar)..so he drives me toward a store and it was like I could hear chanting. I asked him if he was saying stuff or chanting and he would tell me he wasn't but I really thought he was trying to make me trip harder by messing with me. On the way to the store I would look thru the passenger's side window and I got the fright of my life when I did. I seen the most evil looking demonic figure when I would look out the window.it scared me really bad. that was just the beginning of what happened. this thing was so scary to look at that when I would look at it an make eye contact with it it would actually make me go into convulsions. I lost all control of my body when this would make eye contact with me..then it got to where when I would try to look away it would follow..and if I waited to long to move away again it would catch up with me again and do the same thing.i also have to point out that this was not the only way I went into convulsions. either by eye contact or it would just jump into my stomach and I would also convulse. So I was really freaking out. At this point we where supposed to be on our way to get a beer.( I was just trying to get off that bad trip that was comming on at the bar but I grew into something I will never ever forget) I made my friend turn around because of the demonic figures where about ti give me a heart attack I was so scared of this sight. on the way back home,right after he turned around..,i imagined that we had drove head on into an 18 wheeler and got killed..i could hear the screeching metal,then everything got quite a peaceful,but dark an evil quiet. I was terrified at this point. I actually thought we where dead,it was like I was outside of my body looking at us from a different perspective..i thought we where doomed to hell for sure !! This really was just the beginning of the bad trip. so now not only am I dealing with demonic figures,but now I have just visioned us being killed..the demons temporarily disappeared while I was hallucinating about the 18 an us getting in a fatal accident..but later the demons came back. right after the wreck I imagined I grabbed my friend and I had one hand around his shoulder hugging him as tight as I could,like a little scared kid or something..people I was terrified. the reason I grabbed my friend an hugged him is because I thought we had just been killed and I didn't want to loose him or let him go and I wanted him to tell me this wasn't real..when I grabbed him an hugged him he was driving,luckily we where on a back country road going very slow at my request. 5 mph seemed like 90 mph. anyway when I hugged my friend my other hand I was moving it an asking if he could see my hand move. I kept asking him if I was alive an if we had been killed. I asked him about the wreck an he was like what wreck..at this point I still think he is messing with me and I am begging him to please help me an not mess with me. He was actually so scared for me that he was crying!! He brought me to my house and stayed with me the whole night( this isn't the end!!).. okay so when we got home I thought that maybe if I got out an got fresh air I would be ok.. not a chance!! the demonic figures reappeared and this time more scary than before. this time I remember claws on this creature. I kept thinking I would be dragged away. This trip was so intense that there is so much that happened that I will not remember to include in this writting. Well 3 months before this bad trip I was in treatment and my mom bought me this book on near death experiences and one of the stories in that book came into play on this bad acid trip. My life seemed to match someone who had a near death experience and I thought I had to die because the person in that book lived an that we could not both survive the same experience..well I couldn't take it outside my house so we went inside an I went into the bathroom while my friend tried to keep my parents from noticing me. he seemed to be gone forever as I was in the bathroom looking in the mirror (worst mistake). all I seen when I looked in the mirror was a horribly drug ravaged corpse,like it wa me but I was transparent, like some kind of spirit of evil decent,very evil. it scared me so bad that when my friend came into the bathroom I was shaking like a leaf and I asked my friend to feel my heart beating and it scared him so much he went tell my dad what I was on an about my heart. as all this was happening I thought I was either already dead from the 18 wheeler crash or I was going to die,that I was going to be pulled away by this being. well the acid by this time was almost at peak level. well my dad comes in an feels my heart rate and decided to call 911,i was in the living room trying to avoid the demonic figures who kept appearing,still jumping into my stomach and giving me the eye..i also seen the same thing I seen in the mirror,the horrible ghost like double of me. this also made me convulse. I never had anything like that happened to me and I used to do so much shrooms an acid. what I still think is it all built up because after that I always had a bad trip for a few years after. Well the ambulance finally got there and I remember right b4 the ambulance got there the police got there too. they where asking me where I got the acid but the cops where the last thing on my mind.. ok one of the first cops that waled in looked like this friend of mine's dad who was a small time cop in a small town.. the cop looked exactly like that man and I thought I was dead at this point and that cop's spirit was there or something,like I was in some very scary afterlife. when the ambulance showed up they put me in the stretcher and in the back of the ambulance (when I got to the hospital I swore I flew in a helicopter). the ambulance drive I remember part of that,, they would try to make me repeat stuff to see how my brain was reacting. I was also talking to god begging him to let me live an I was praying I wasn't already dead but I was convinced I was. I guess they wanted me to pee or something but I thought they where draining all the fluids out of my body because I was dead. the iv's made me think the same thing.. that they where preparing me to embalm..later at the hospital I could hear them talking about funeral arrangements and everyone I seen looked like family members who had flew in from all over the us to see me one last time. I could smell the embalming fluid and I foreseen my funeral and I imagined how everyone would react. while I was recovering(even though I didn't know I was yet)i would see people who had been dead,they would walk in an this would further confirm I must be dead.It was not until the doc asked me if I wanted to see my mom that I started to get my head.. then my mom came in( I still thought I wad dead)and she was rubbing my forehead an saying to me now you see what drugs can do.. I though she was saying that to her son's corpse. at that time I said 'moma can you hear me?' and then she said yes..that was the most beautiful yes I ever hear because at that moment reality started to come back to me. the whole time before all the doctors an nurses seemed to not be talking or communicating with me.it was not till I asked my mom is she could hear me that I realized I was indeed still here on earth an not awaiting hell an a funeral. listen people I have left out things I would have definitely wanted to include.. this trip was so intense, so detailed,so supernatural that to this day I think that something very supernatural occurred. I was very lucky not to die..the doc said the lad wouldn't have killed me but I could have died of fright.Well after this experience I still kinda thought I might really be dead and for about a year I wouldn't go into any cemetary because I was terrified I would fine my own grave an that is when I thought I would have to finish with the death part of the trip. this permanently damaged my brain people. I couldn't accept what had happened to me so I decided to do acid again about 3 months after this bad trip and do you know what kinda acid I done?? Pink elephant !!! and I done a half a hit more than what put me in the hospital and although I tripped killer I didn't have that bad trip BUT after that I started to have bad trips again, nothing like the pink elephant experience.. however I had a mushroom bad trip a couple years later and it was almost as bad.Well I hope everyone uses Lsd with more caution than I did.. don't mix drugs, especially coke speed an acid. peace an love to everyone and remember if you find yourself on a bad trip just remember you aren't going to die and that many others have been thru more intense trips than you have. there will always be someone who does more than the next person..just be careful.Exp Year: 1991ExpID: 2002Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 21, 2000Views: 64,495    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Various (28) DOSE:7 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)Last night, a group of my frineds dropped some pretty strong acid. The acid was 'Blue Sunshine': white blotter paper with a part of a blue sun on the front with small, thin pink lines on the back. Four of my friends, J.F., D.M., C.J. and J.B. took 2, 2, 3, and 7 respectively. The two that took two said that they peaked in twenty minutes and that it was one of the most intense trips they had ever had (they are pretty experienced). The one that did 3, C.J., was passing out, curled up in a ball, and couldn't really move. He damanded that the others take him to the hospital, so they did. We think he was tied down and perhaps given thorazine (reports are uncertain). About 12 hours later, we found out that he was in a coma and that his doctors were concerned about possible heart problems. (however, someone has said that he did/was doing ice and crack, which is most likely considering the outcome).Now, the last is the most bizarre. He (J.B.) dropped 7 that night. Holding a knife in his hands, he calmly declared that he was going to kill himself. D.M. knocked the knife out of his hands. J.B. then stripped down to his underwear and proceeded to attack D.M. The group went and hid in D.M.'s car while J.B. curled up into a ball on the curb. He then jumped up and ran into the hills, not to be seen for the rest of the night. Talking to him today, we discovered what became of him the rest of that night (at least what he could recall). He remembered being in a tree and demanding of someone below their knives and guns. He then proceeded to the backdoor of someones house (sliding glass door). The man sitting inside looked up and was surprised to see someone in his backyard. J.B. proceeded to run/jump _through_ the glass door, into the house, cutting himself up in the process. He then demanded of the man all his knives and guns in the house. The man ran into his bedroom and locked the door. J.B. tried to knock the door down. The man called the police. In the mean time, J.B. had gone into the mans kitchen. He drank some skim milk and took some pills that were laying around the house. A cop comes in, tries to restrain J.B. J.B. struggles and the cop hits him. J.B. gets angry and punches the cop, knocking him (a 6'4', 240 pound cop) to the floor. Other cops come in and start beating J.B. and spraying him with mace. They take J.B. to the hospital where he was strapped down to his bed with leather straps. When his eyes cleared from the mace, he saw a bunch of people looking over him (cops, docs, nurses, etc). He then breaks free of the straps and punches another cop. The strapped him back down and gave him a shot of thorazine, pumped his stomach, and called his parents. The man whose house he did this at is supposedly under psychological help for the trauma he recieved. The hospital reported that they had three cases that night of bad trips and labelled it 'bad acid'.Now, I am not using these stories to show that acid is bad. What I am saying is that you have to be careful. They were told by the person they bought it from to take no more the three, tops. They had never taken this batch of acid and didn't know its strength. They should have taken one or two to see. That and if they were going to push it, they should have had a sober, experienced person to help if things get tough. Acid is powerful stuff. Be very aware. Use common sense. And watch out, this batch is potent.Exp Year: 1994ExpID: 2006Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 21, 2000Views: 26,220    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Various (28) DOSE:  oralLSDI bought some LSD from a guy I worked with back in October. They were in sugar cube form. I took them home and put them in my desk. I had tripped on acid a few times before, but either with a friend or at school. I was home by myself one night (I live with my parents) and the temptation was too much. People had told me before to never trip alone because it would send me on a bad trip. But I decided... What the hell! VERY BAD DECISION. I took one cube and forty five minutes passed without effect. (It usually took about thirty minutes in my previous trips.) I took a second and waited about five minutes and I could feel it start to take effect. I wanted to be taking a shower when it fully hit me. (It's a bigger trip than you can imagine unless you've done it before.) I showered for about fifteen minutes and then got out to discover my parents were home early. 'Okay, I'll just play it off and say I'm going to bed', I thought to myself. I got in my room and laid on my bed looking at the ceiling. I could actually feel and see the ceiling dripping on my face. This was some very trippy stuff. Foolishly, I turned out the light. I got back in bed and after a couple of minutes started getting real scared. I thought for some reason that I was going to die. I would close my eyes for awhile, then open them to make sure I wasn't dead yet. My whole life started flashing before my eyes. (Sorry for the cliche) It got to the point where I was so scared I was going to die that I thought to my self, 'I need to get some help before this ends my life.' I got out of bed and walked down the hall to the living room where my dad was watching TV. 'I'm on LSD and I think I'm going to die!', I blurted out. If I was about to die but needed something to push me over the edge, the look on my dad's face would have done it. 'WHAT!?!?!?!?!' He was reeeeeaaaallly pissed. He sat me down on the couch and tried to calm me down. From that point on, I only remember flashes of what happened. I remember taking a cushion off the couch and throwing it into the fireplace. Then I remember walking back towards my room. My dad put his hand on my shoulder and I involuntarily turned around and planted a fist on his jaw. He grabbed me and threw me onto the couch and yelled 'Now you stay there!', and got on the phone. Next thing I new, I was staring up at half a dozen unfamiliar faces. They all had walkie-talkies and I heard one of them say (while holding a flashlight in my eyes) 'You can't see anything but the pupil.' They put my shoes on me and led me out the front door. My first step outside was not very stable and I ended up face first on the sidewalk, with blood running out of my forehead. They carried me to an ambulance and I don't remember anything else except arriving at the hospital and looking up at doctors who were strapping things with with wires attached to them on my chest a poking me with hard objects. I was strapped down on my bed and I kept trying to get up. An old ugly nurse kept coming over and asking me the same questions over and over and it was driving me insane. 'This is hell.' I thought. I've already died and I'm in hell. You don't (or maybe you do) know what it's like thinking your in hell. I started crying because I was so scared. Then I fell asleep and woke up to a doctor's voice. 'How ya doin? Ya feel allright?' 'Yeah, I'm okay.' I replied. 'You ready to go home?'(Stupid question) 'Most definitely' I said. As I got up and started leaving with my dad I heard him say 'You're a very lucky young man.' Whatever that meant. Besides the bad memories, I have a fuckin' huge hospital bill that my insurance won't pay for because it was a drug related incident. I haven't even had a beer since that night. I'm afraid to what it might lead to. Well, thanks for taking the time to read this, I'm not trying to scare anyone, or tell you to quit using, I just know what it's like to have a bad experience and if you haven't tried acid yet and are thinking about it, make sure you know what you're getting into.

One night after work my ex-friend called me.  He asked if I wanted to come over and go on a trip.  I was very excited and I rushed over.  When I got there my friends (we will call D.B. and J.K. were there along with a boy who I did not know.  D.B. pulled out six hits of an acid called Dancing Condoms, it was a puzzle with little dancing condoms on it.  It was me and the other boy's first time so we only took a half of a hit. I waited about 45 minutes and nothing was happening.  I noticed that the other boy was acting very weird.  I thought maybe the acid was fake so I took the rest of the dancing condom and 3/4 of a hit of white blotter.A little later D.B. went to get some bud.  When he got back we smoked 1 good sized bowl.  About a minute after the bowl I was feeling very fucked up.  At first I felt very high and started to laugh at evrything.  D.B. and I went back to his room to get another bowl.  I was sitting on his bed and I dazed off I had thoughts of life and death without even trying to think about it.  Suddenly the whole room caved in on me and I came out of the daze.  D.B. kept talking to me but I didn't even know where I was.  I could not comprehend why I was this fucked up.  I looked at the pot and all I saw was pine needles.  I asked D.B. if that was what we smoked and he asked me what I was talking about. I looked again and It was regular marijuana.We went in the living room and sat down.  I kept dazing off and suddenly the room went dark ond colors of neon green and pink were everywhere.  I felt like I was all alone and nobody else realy existed but they were all just images.  I was looking at my arms and they turned into clay and crumbled to the ground.  Everybodies hair was changing color and everyones faces were scrambling around.  I was feeling very scared.  D.B. took me in the other room and he kept yelling at me.  He told that the demons were coming and I was going to go to hell.  Suddenly I saw a flash of light and D.B. became a demond.  The vains were popping out of his head and his eyes were dripping blood and hirns came out of his head.  I started talking to J.K. and he calmed me down he told me it was from the acid and D.B. was just trying to scare me.  In the middle of our talk his face formed into another demon and he was screaming at me.  I was looking at the walls and it was covered with huge pentagrams.  After a few hours of running through the house screaming I finally came down. After that, ever time I smoked weed I saw designs on the walls.  I started to trip one time after 2 gravity bong hits.  The room was melting and I was extremely paranoid.  If I didn't have a bad trip my first time I would probably do it again, but out of fear I will never take it again.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 446Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jul 30, 2000Views: 7,317    LSD (2) : First Times (2), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:  oralLSD(blotter / tab)one day my friend came back from Madison with some acid (i think like 10 hits) so me, him and my other friend all dropped. I didnt feel anything a few hours afterwords so i figured that it wasnt going to work...how wrong i was.. we took it during the day (it was still light out) and eventually (at night) to made our way outside of his apartment and proceeded to smoke a few joints. It wasn't five minutes later that it hit me. We walked through the hallway to the other side of the building and sat into my car. It was then that i looked at the steering wheel and it turned into a weird lookin funnel. There were black and white rings spiraling down into what looked like a neverending hole. i looked over totally freaked out and then i was like 10ft of in the distance hovering outside of my body with no control. This was the shittiest feeling ive ever felt. At first i felt like i was watching some movie, then i realized that it wasnt a movie at all, instead it was me making an complete ass out of my self infront of my friends. After that i got out of the car (in slow motion) and was talking to my friend(he told me later i said i thought i was going to die) we then went inside where i laid on the floor for about 3-4 hours, every minute feeling like an eternity, thinking i was completely insane. I could see my myself in a straightjacket boucing off the walls in my padded room because thats where i was gonna be come day time when  everybody sees how crazy ive gotten, or at least thats what i thought. I just laid there with my mind racing, totally overcome by panic and fear, thinking i was some raving lunatic, and thought that id rather be dead than feel like that. In any manner it finally ended and i dont think ill ever try doing anything stupid like that again.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 718Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Aug 1, 2000Views: 5,571    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:50 kgI dropped 1 tab, basically had a very sketchy bad trip.

The article read that a local teen alledged of been on LSD was arrested for disruption of peace, disortly conduct, resisting arrest, and a whole other list of what seemed to be petty charges.  But the article forgot to mention a few details. And I know because I was there, it happened at my house.My boyfriend, three of his friends, and I went to a party and bought some acid.  Each of us had taken two purple gel tabs.  All of us except for one of my boyfriends friends had taken gel tabs before.  James had only tripped one time and it had been off of one hit of blotter.  My boyfriend and his friends headed back to our house and me and one of my girlfriends went to Perkins to get something to eat.  We had just gotten oiur food and I was starting to feel sick.  My friend said that I looked kind of pale and I went to the bathroom and threw up.  Before I puked I hadn't started tripping, but as soon as I walked out of the bathroom my buzz majorly kicked in.  I didn't feel sick any more and I felt really good.  On my way home I was seeing really awesome chasers off the stars.  I thought it was going to be the best trip that I had ever had.  I was going to find out very soon that I was wrong.  I got back to my house and started to watch T.V. The boys were in the kitchen doing something.  My boyfriend told me that he and one of the other boys were going to go get something to eat and that they would be back. (Note:  I was Trippin' I forgot that he told me that.)  So they leave and I go in the kitchen with Jeremy and James (the two friends that were still there.)  Now I had tripped a few times before this and I had never had a bad experience with acid.  I always had a really good time and I laughed a lot. Even the first time that I did it, and the same with all of my friends that had done it.  (and we were not big drug doers.  We smoked weed and that was it.)  So James seems to be getting kind of uneasy.  And he asked me 'Where did Mike go?' (Mike was my boyfriend)  and I told him that I didn't know.  And he asked me if I was worried about him and I told him no.  So about five seconds later James asks me the same question.  So I give him the same answer. Jeremy noticed that James was acting kind of funny so he told him that Mike went to the store and that he would be right back.  (because we forgot where he told us that he went.)  So James starts to get really weird.  And he looks right at me, almost like he was looking in me and he askd me 'is this the truth?'  and I had no fucking idea what he was talking about.  And I just looked at him funny.  Because it wasn't that he was asking me if Mike really went to the store, I didn't know what he wanted to know.  So them he gets real excited and he says , 'We're tripping on acid.  We're tripping on acid!'  And then we asked if this was reality.  I told him that it was and that we were just tripping and everything was okay.  So he was like, 'I like you.' And I told him that I liked him to.  And he said, 'No.  I don't think you understand.  I like you.'  So I got the hint and told him that that was very nice of him to say but that I already had a boyfriend.  And he wasn't satisfied by that.  He was like, 'Just tell me that you like me.' And he gave me this really evil look and I shit you not he drilled into my head and asked me, 'where is Mike then?'   and I got really scared then and I yelled. 'I told you that I didn't know!'  and he got really quiet and he said 'Mike is dead.'  and I was like 'No, that's stupid.' but since I was tripping I started to think about it and it did seem like he was gone for a really long time and we were all tripping, so I started to get worried.  But then I was like no way.  But James was convinced and he kept looking at me asking me the same question in my head. (now I don't know anything scientific about this, but once my boyfriend told me that if two people are tripping that they can talk to each other and not say anything.  Up until that point I thought he was full of shit, but I swear on my life and I swear to this day that James and I were going back and forth, and not saying anything out loud.)  So I'm starting to freak out now.  Yelling to James, in my head, to shut the fuck up and leave me alone.  And then he says with dead serousness, 'Mike is dead and you're my girlfriend now, and this is my house.'  and Jeremy finally speaks up and says, 'no, this is not your house.  And there are two other roommates upstairs who aren't tripping who are trying to sleep.'  And then James told Jeremy that he looked like a vampire and told him not to talk anymore.  I looked at James, and I mean this was the first time that I realized that I was looking at him and he looked like he was dead.  He was really tall and skinny and his face was almost a yellow color and his lips were purple and his eyes looked really blank.  So I said that I was going to go upstairs and go to sleep.  I got halfway up the stairs and James grabs my arm and drags me back into the kitchen.  He sits me down in a chair and tells me that I'm not allowed to move.  And then he puts his arms around my head, almost like in a headlock, and starts breathing really heavy.  I was like fuck this and I got up and I ran up the stairs. (like in the scary movies when the girl goes up the stairs when she should really leave the house.) And I go up into my girfriend Meg's room, and I tell her to lock her door. All of a sudden I hear this like crashing downstairs and I'm trying to explain to Meg what was going on.  The I hear James making all of these sex noices and he was yelling my name.  Now up until this point this boy had barely spoken to me.  He was always very quiet and polite.  Then he was yelling, 'where are you?  I can feel you.' and a few more explicit things that I don't care to go into detail about.  And then I heard a bang and I heard him coming up the stairs.  He went right to Meg's door and started pounding on it.  Demanding that I come out.  He got down on the floor and was sticking his hand undre th door going ,'Oh, I can feel you.  Let me in!'  I by this point was sitting on the bed bawling, but trying to be as quiet as I possibly could and just praying that the whole thing was just a bad dream and that it would be over soon, or that Mike would come home, or anything.  And I wanted to put my head right through the wall.  We wanted to call the cops, but we didn't have a phone in the room.  Finally James was making so much noise that our other roommate woke up.  And we heard him come out of his room and go, 'Dude what the fuck.'  And James said, 'I'll suck your dick.'  and our roommate started swearing and then we heard this big rukus in the hall.  Meg opened the door a crack and then shut it really quick.  She said, 'OH my god.  He is buck naked.'  I guess he tried to grab our roommate and our roommate tackled him to the floor and beat the hell out of him.  Then our roommate called the cops and told us not to come out of the bedroom until the cops got there.  Like that was an option.  James continued to lie on the floor and scream out my name until the police got there.  When they got there they brought an ambulance.  James trold the cops that he didn't care what they did to him because he was God and he created everything.  And he kept yelling that he had figured 'IT' out and htat he was the smartest man alive.  The cops thought that it was kind of funny.  I didn't.  They finally took him out in a straight jacket.  Just as they were taking him out Mike and his friend came home.  Mike said that James was screaming about how he had figured it out and then yelled to Mike that he wasn't gay.A policeman came to talked to me and there was no way I was going to tell him what really happened, so I just told him that I was sitting at my house and Jmes just walked in and started flipping out.  And the cop said, 'well I heard there was some LSD going around.'  (thanks for the tid bit officer.)  So after everybody was cleared out I went to the bathroom and threw up, again.  And I just laid in my bed and cried until I went to sleep.  To this very day James is not the same.  In fact now he's referred to around town as Crazy James.  I don't live in the town anymore and I don't usually like to tell people about what happened, but in a small town everybody knows everything anyway.  A year later I did acid again.  And I was fine.  After the whole thing happened I went online and looked up everything that I could find about LSD.  I read a book called 'Using LSD to heighten the Buddhist Tibetan Experience' and it tells you how to prepare for using LSD and how to calm someone down who is having a bad trip.  What I've learned in all my experiences with LSD (because this was not the first bad trip that I've seen, but definitely the worst.) I've come to realize an important lesson.  A weak mind can't handle a strong drug.  You have to be totally comfortable with who you're tripping with.  And just have fun don't be scared.  Now as far as talking without saying anything...it hasn't happened since, but if it does happen to you just hope that it somebody that you feel okay about it happening with.  And be careful.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 513Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Sep 8, 2000Views: 34,398    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:10 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:170 lbA few weeks ago after a local concert a friend of mine named Chris and I had nothing to do, and it was about 1:30am. I offered him to trip with me and we both dropped a ten strip of pink elephant blotter. We are both experienced acid heads who've done that much before, so we weren't expecting anything out of the ordinary which is why we didn't get a sitter.At about 2 while I was buying Chris some cigaretts the acid began to work. As I walked into the CVS, the shop lifting detectors started to go off. This got me really paranoid and I thought that someone was going to arrest me so I ran out of the store and threw anything in my pockets that would've set off the alarm, and went back in. This time it was ok and nothing was beeping so I bought the cigarettes, and when I gave her the money her face became colored with what reminded me of indian war paint. I got to thinking that, I was in store for a really intense trip, that I wasn't prepared for.We got to Chris's house and sat in my friend Shaun's van, I asked Chris how he was doing and he said he wasn't doing that well and he thought it was a little too intense too. After talking to Chris for awhile I looked out the window of the van, and saw a pit of alligators and other lizards where grass normally is. I thought this was amazing and couldn't believe how real they looked, and all of a sudden a man riding a horse was charging down the street. Holy shit I thought, he's coming for me. Then he was gone I look all around and the alligators are still there. This isn't good my visuals usually go away after blinking or looking at something else, but this was different they wouldn't leave, are they real or fake I couldn't decided. My mind would not tell me. I tell Chris whats going on he isn't doing well either but by far better than I'm doing. He tells me to go with him to see Shaun. I don't want to leave the gators were still there, he convinces me to go with him somehow. Inside Shaun's house the concrete floor is nothing but crocodile heads, and then blue and orange snakes apear and I can feel them crawling beneath my feet. Finally, Shaun shows up my whole body is shaking and I've chewed a straw into almost nothing. Shaun trys to calm me down but he can't help. So we leave.Next thing I can remember we're in a soccer field sitting on some bleachers the aligators are still there, but I've found out they don't want me, right now all of the alligators are fighting and fucking each other and are ignoring me for now. As we walk into the field there is a force field constructed by diamond shapes and as I walk through I can feel it. The stars in the sky have turned red and are shooting out white light. I look across the street and see dinosaurs, I ignore them. Holy shit there are 2 cars pulling into the field, are they cops? My friend assures me they are not and I hear a robotic voice yell 'get over here' Chris tells me he didn't hear anything. I begin to power walk back to Shaun's. That is all I can remember from that night, but I know I spent a lot more time shaking and being frightened. I think I had such a bad trip because of two things, one no sitter, and two I couldn't decifer what was real or fake. The whole next day I didn't sleep at all and spent most of the day silent.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 1152Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Sep 11, 2000Views: 5,684    LSD (2) : Various (28), Bad Trips (6), General (1) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:115 lbThis is one of the worst trips I have ever had on LSD. It is also one of the most important experiences I have had and has shaped the way I look at the workings of the human mind.This experience happened when I was 17 years old and I am now 23. At this time I had been experimenting with LSD for a couple years and had many deeply profound experiences previous to this 'event'. I had also had some terrible trips which had given me insight into the realm of true insanity and reality altering psychosis. Most of these other trips had been too chaotic and detached from reality for me to comprehend from a SANE perspective. They were more or less the most disturbing experiences of my life...but this experience brought a new meaning to 'BAD TRIP'.At this time in my life I was going to raves on a weekly basis. Me and my very close friends went to a party that was mostly dark and fast techno (hardcore). As far as set and setting goes this is a horrible mistake, but I was a young kid and did not know about safe and comfortable settings. Adding to the dark atmosphere was an overwhelming bad attitude coming from most people. I ate 2 hits of unknown blotter even though my tolerence for substances was/is EXTREMELY low. It turns out this was REALLY potent LSD as well.About 45 minutes after ingesting the doses I was in the bathroom watching a crack deal happen. At this point I am beyond the jittery 'coming on' effects, and I am starting to feel extremely altered. Someone selling crack at a party is the last thing I need to see so I go out into the barely lit main room and try to dance to the dark sounds coming out of the overdriven and distorting sound system. Within a few minutes reality begins to crumble in a way I had never experienced and would never experience again. All the sounds going into my head seemed to be perpetually dropping in pitch as well as the rate of the 'cycles' I heard/felt. Then all of a sudden I would realize that it was actually happening super fast but still dropping in frequency. This sound began to effect me physically. Pure terror started to creep over my mind and body. It was like the sound of decay at an unbearable volume breathing into my being. From here on until I came back to reality time was an unknown concept and had no affect on my thought process. I remember wandering around suffering from deep dread and undescribable doom. This feeling can not be communicated in words. I found myself outside of the main room and at a small set of steps which led to a small platform and a lifesized crusified jesus. Turns out this rave was being put on in a community center where church services are held! That still disturbs me because of the type of energy which was manifesting at that party. Anyway, at this point I sort of collapse in front of this statue. And as the world slips further away I feel every part of my being die and begin to decay. To this day I don't think I have felt as overwhelmed with fear and dread as i did then. I felt as though years and then decades and centuries passed within seconds as my physical form decayed into the earth which quickly covered 'me' up. It was almost like I was watching it happen in a time lapse video or stop animation. I look back on this as the symbolic death of my ego. Next, I remember being back at the party, but now all of the hundreds of kids are demonic/angelic entities and their focus is on me.  The music has stopped and a creepy energy is begining to pulsate out of the crowd. I know that they are trying to convince me of taking on a powerful role of some sort which I know is against all I stand for. I now find myself on the stage looking out into the crowd. (It is important that I mention that I was raised Catholic, but I had become a believer in a more chaotic higher power than the god I was taught about as a boy.) Then, I felt as though 'they' were right and I should take on this role. This made me feel exulted and full of power and cosmic importance. The music came back on and it was glorious. Then, quickly I knew that this was wrong and that 'they' were tricking me into some kind of eternal damnation and the terror came back stronger than before. They knew I had changed my mind and the music stopped abruptly and was replaced by the 'evil energy'.I knew that my decision had eternal and cosmic consequence and that the 'wrong' decision would be the end of EVERYTHING. This continued for what seemed like eternity untill I 'woke up' outside in the car we came in with all my friends looking at me, half amused and half terrified. At this point I realized I had been saying the word 'heaven' over and over again. It felt like a mantra that I had to repeat to get 'out' of the place I was trapped in (the darkest depthes of my mind). I came down almost instantly from a peak and being back in the real world was shocking and terrifying because then I understood what I had just gone through in a more 'conscious' state of mind. I told everyone right there to never let me injest LSD ever again. Needless to say I did continue experiments in the world of psychedelics and have had experiences that were quite the opposite of this one. I felt much peace and unity with the universe since that event, but that experience was the most seperated from the 'essence of life' that I have ever felt. This event taught me about how important the mind set and the environment around you are while playing with the chemicals in your head. It also made me realize how much a hallucinogenic experience can teach you about your perception of the world as well as your subconscious struggles. It made me see how much I am a part of the universe and how everything I do affects everyone and everything. I continue on my path to this day (however infrequently it happens)...

One day my friend jami and i was going to trip (nothin unusual for us) and we always take at least 5 hits. That day we decieded to take a 10 strip apiece. We ate it at my house and had no plans but to trip, so we started off on foot walkin to this guys house about 3 miles away. It wasnt even a mile down the road the potent acid was kickin in.My mind started to wonder off and think. We began to walk really fast. we were about half way there and we passed this old school and there were people on the playground they began to yell at us. By that time my mind was at top speed and I was in a scared state of consciouness. The people were really there, but we were too scared to even look their way. i know i was going on a bad one because i started to think about the weed in my pocket i was about to throw it away because i thought forshore the cops were going to stop us (which in reality no cops were going to stop us for no reason.) We got to the main road and we had to cross it. damn i didnt even think about that before we left. I was really having trouble talkin and comprehinding at this point. The cars were going by us and all i seen was tracers as far as you can see, thats what made crossing the road so hard (lucky i made it a cross to tell you about it) me and my friend and i made it across the road we looked at each other and said 'we'll talk when we get there' cause we were having to concentrate on everything else that was going on such as cars cause we were still on roads just anything cause when your this high EVERYTHING IS CRAZY.We start walkin up this hill to get to this guys house. Here is when it starts getting bad I ASKED WERE WE WERE AT AND IVE WALKED UP THIS HILL A MILLION TIMES. but the thing is I hardly ever hung out at the guys house we were going to and hardly never hungout with any of the people either (i should have thought about set and setting before i went up here and put my self into a bad situtation) We get to the guys house and at first it was cool me and my friend put on pink floyd and sat back and looked at everything turn tyedie and swril and spin around. Then before i knew it i was scared as hell for no reason THIS WAS THE SCARIEST THING IN MY LIFE AND FOR NO REASON. I CANT EXPLAIN THE FEAR I FELT.I began to hear sirens and get extreamly paranoid and the setting was totaly not good ive never chilled at this guys house before and hardly didnt know these people. (my fault for putting my self in this situation) This feeling of never coming down  was so strong i was convinced i was dying and it was the end and the more i thought about what was going on the more the feeling grew. Before long the whole house knew what was going on.i was hiding in the guys room completly terrorfied hearing sirens thinking people were coming to get me.Then I began to get violent.  I told everybody that they were against me and i hated them and then they tried to calm me down and i then told them that i loved them then it would start back worse than ever. they tried to take me outside to get my mind off of the bad trip but the feeling just keep getting worse i was running away from them in the road and then get a little ways away and run back to them and then when i got back to them i thought it was my enemies again. By then i was screaming out stuff off the top of my head about different girls ive been with, me going to jail (which ive never been at all) thinking my truck was wrecked (which my truck was totaly fine) my hair was sticking straight up it had looked like i had been swimming i was beating up everybody (i had super human strenght) it took 3 guys to hold me back and they were still having a hard time.I was so scared i called my mom (big mistake) by that time the guys mom and dad at the house knew what was going on cause i was screaming that i was never coming down and all that other crazy stuff i was doing. they got on the phone with my mom and told  her were they lived and got my mom right up there. my mom came though the door and there for a sec i was alright (i guess the trust and safety i felt around her made me feel good) i went and gave her a hug and then i flipped out again and tried to hurt her (i so wish that didnt happen).They called the cops that instant i had no idea what the hell was going on i just thought it was the end. The cop comes in and i try to attack him he sprays me with Mace and gets me down (i was screaming lets just smoke weed. what the hell was i thinking) the paramedics came in and gave me a shot of thorazine. then off to the hospital.I kind of remember the ambulance ride not really. i came to in the hospital and this women started asking all the question (i just said i dont know to everything she asked) i was still seeing all the crazy visuals but my mind was back as if i had a good acid trip (thorazine is good stuff) my mom was standing over me and saying you did it this time (i was thinking damn how could this happen to me) i felt like shit cause i flipped out at a guys house i hardly ever hangout with his parents were there. my hospital bill was $2500; an expensive acid trip. they released me and it was as if i was on a good trip i came home and sat down on my bed and smoked a little weed and thought how crazy that shit was.NOW THIS IS A LESSON YOU CAN TRIP THOUSANDS OF TIMES AND HAVE GOOD ONES BUT THEN YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT COULD GO BAD.Exp Year: 1999ExpID: 3445Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 24, 2000Views: 16,143    LSD (2) : Various (28), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:7 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:140 lbi have been visiting this site for quite some time now, as it is an extremely valuable source for info that i believe should be required to know before one ventures into the vast world of psychedelics.  Lately ive been noticing a lot of reports dealing with 'bad trips' or bad first experiences. i thought i would share my freakout story which is a pretty good one, in hopes that it can help another in understanding a similar situation.  well it all started one fateful friday night when a hippy friend of mine brought over this blotter with a picture of timothy leary imprinted on it.  i thought hey cool an acid guru ill buy 10 (price was another factor in this decision as they were extremely cheap, 10 for 20)  the plan was to eat the cid the following day and head to the aquarium and look at the fish along with various other light hearted tripping activities to take place in the big city of seattle.  i think i should make it clear at this point that this was the third time i had ever tripped on acid and that the first two times yielded barely a threshold experience.  a close friend of mine suggested that since it was blotter it was probably weak and so i figured id eat as much as he did. 7 hits total of the best acid that has come to this area in a while. needless to say it didnt take me long to realize how horribly i screwed up.  we started the day out by 'racing' the acid to the aquarium. (we dosed and then drove down I5 at top speed as the acid very quickly kicked in) we got to our destination and discovered that the aquarium was closed. a panic and terror i still have troubles describing to this day swept over me and everything and everyone looked how id imagine them to look if the world had just ended.  we wandered aimlessly to a park where we sat for maybe an hour maybe four i cannot say as at this time i became lost inside my head in a world where time did not exist. it was as though i were experiencing all of time from the begging and it was all leading up to what i much later have realized was the death of my ego.  at this time in my life i was very depressed and their were many wierd tensions within the group of friends i was tripping with. both of these factors played a big part in what happened next.  we left the park and some how found our way to our car (i managed to cross a busy city street without the aid of a cross walk by merely timing my way through traffic, much like playing frogger) we got into the car and as we drove from the piers to the freeway both my two friends and i had what i later found out were simotanious hallucinations, our car had turned into a spaceship of somesort, upon realizing that this was happening my friend m began to puke up a dayglow orange bile that was the consistancy of gack or runny jello. i was convinced that she was an alien and that i had been somehow at the park shifted into another dimension.  we made to my friend j's moms place where i suddenly was struck by the fact that we must have all died and were now in pergatory. at this point i had said very little, infact nothing for several hours, but everyone else was in seemingly good spirits which confused me a great deal as we were all dead, and that scared me deeper than anything.  i began to lose it, i thought that both my female friends were my recently made x girlfriend and tried to make out with both of them. i thought for a time i was a god of this pergatory and then that my friend r was god and he was going to kill me for trying to kiss his girlfriend. i then made my way to j's moms shower which had one of those heat lamps in it. this combined with the neo hippy hicus about cleanliness and spirituality lead me to believe that the shower was the way to heaven. of course i did not ascend and so i ran about the house naked and began to seriously freak, my friends took turns (and no offense to them but poorly so) trying to calm me down. my friend k decided it might be a good idea as he put in his not really that intelligent psychoanalytical terms, to 'help me die' of couse this only furthered my freakout and i know realized that all my friends were demons taking my life from me and that the only way to get to heaven was to simply let go of my life on earth. i did and then i lost conciousness.  at this point it was as though i was drifting between worlds, i would gain conciousness in one world where my friends j and k were pounding on my chest and opening my eyes for me in an attempt to get me to as they put it 'snap out of it' then i would fade into another where j's mom was soothing me and telling me that i had just eaten some bad acid and that i would be ok.  of course this all was happening linearly in time but at this point i had no real concept of linear time which was very cool but very strange as well. needless to say j's mom knew what was up (shes an old hippy) and she calmed me down. but it took four days for me to get my mind straight and to stop believeing my delusions. the point of this story as i see it to emphasize set and setting as well caution and knowing what a drug is all about before you jump in to it.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 3462Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 25, 2000Views: 5,208    LSD (2) : Various (28), Post Trip Problems (8), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:5 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:155 lbThis was the first time I have ever taken LSD and it was the worst, and I will NEVER do it again, people say that it is the best feeling, and you can see objects that you could never see unless you are on the drug but what I saw and what happened to me wasn't a pleasurable experience...Friday night at a party me and 2 of my friends decided we were all 3 going to trip for the first time. So we were all partying smoking pot, having a good time. Then we we talked to this dude, and he said that he could hook us up with a few hits of LSD. We said 'how many should we take?' and the dude said 'Well if it is your first time, I wouldn't take more than 5' so we all took five a piece except for one of my friends only took 3. So we were all still having a good time after we had taken our 5 hits, we went on partying still having a good time, and we weren't really feeling all of the side affects that everyone said we would. So then we went to go smoke up to try and get a better high. We smoke about 4-5 bowls, then went back to the party.EVERYTHING was different.  It was like I was in a different house, we had been gone away from the house about 2 hours and now it felt like I knew NOBODY!! I was afraid until my friend who only took 3 hits calmed me down, after about 5 minutes that seemed like 1 hour I was calm then we all went into the 'Trip-room'.  I will never forget this for the rest of my life. The room was designed for people who were tripping, and the more acid you took the more of a trip you would feel. I was sweating and I had cold chills and I was just so scared but I couldn't move my eyes from all of the lights and movements. My friend had put on a costume dressed as Chucky (from Child's Play). I hated that movie, I was so scared of it when I was a kid! It was him dressed up as Chucky but he was talkin in his real voice, so I thought he had turned into Chucky.It seemed so real and I tried getting a knife and stabbing him but nothing seemed to work I couldnt kill the mother fucker!! even though it was my friend behind the costume he had a bullet proof vest on and a thick protection cover underneath his costume so everytime I would stab him he would just come back at me saying 'I am the the devil and I am taking your soul' It scared the shit out of me and I couldn't stand it anymore so I left the room running down the street trying to hide because I didnt want him to take my soul I scared 'shit-less!!'I didn't know where to go I just knew that I had to get out of there. I finally stopped running and I looked behind me and everyone was gone I had left the party and walked about 2 miles down the road and I was at a gas station so I went in the gas station and tried to use the phone, but I couldn't remember the number to my friends cell phone, so I called up a different friend to get my out of that damn place. He said he would call the party and tell someone to come get me....well he called the party and told the guy that was wearing the Chucky costume to come pick me up. That was the end I was so freaked out.I was at the peak of my Trip and I couldn't stand it anymore.  I went into convulsions, and I started shaking and having a seizure! They all rushed me to the hospital and, the doctor gave me some kind of shot, and just told me to wait it out. It may not seem like that was scary but think about something that scared you when you were a kid and then have some dress up in that same costume. If it doesn't scare the shit out of you, then you didnt take Acid!I will never do LSD again and I am not saying that everyone shouldn't do it, just make sure you know how much to take the first time you do it, and be around people you are good friends with!Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 3458Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 25, 2000Views: 11,787    LSD (2) : Large Group (10+) (19), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Bad Trips (6), First Times (2) DOSE:3 tabletsoralMDMA    oralLSD(liquid)BODY WEIGHT:100 lbI was at the House Connection 2 tour, in a well-known warehouse in Seattle, an ususpecting little raver kid in for a long ride. I had expected to take a bomb or two, like always, but nothing prepared me for what lay ahead. At approx. 11:30 I took the first amsterdam mini, after being warned by my friend A to take only half of it. Half an hour later, I didn't feel anything, so I took the other two. The party was bumpin' and I had just started to feel the ecstasy when I ran into my friend G. He asked me if I was high, and I told him I was starting to be, but I didn't feel high enough. He asked if I wanted some acid, and I followed him into the other room, where our friend E was selling acid from a breath-savers bottle. E handed me the bottle, and told me to take as much as I wanted. The next thing I knew, G was grabbing the vial out of my hand. 'Are you crazy?' he asked me. 'How much did I just take?' The darkness had obscured any notion of exactly how many drops had fallen on my tongue. He looked at me and laughed, holding up the bottle. 'Somewhere between 25 and 30 hits....'Not even 20 minutes later, I realized something was wrong. My vision was completely gone, I was seeing a total fantasy party. I was standing with a large group of people near a couch, feeling very sick. I remember my friend A asking if I was okay. 'No,' I told her, 'I'm not.' She kept trying to get me to drink water, but I couldn't force myself to drink it. Finally, she dragged me outside. I couldn't walk by myself, so she held me up. I rambled incoherently about the meaning of life, thinking I was Michael Jackson, and the Moonwalk, in no particular order. Outside, the fresh air made me feel a little better, and I told her I was okay. She walked me back to our group by the couch, where my friend P was seated. He asked if my tummy felt any better, and poked me. I started vomiting, covering everything in my way. I couldn't stop. 'Can I die now please?' I kept asking. I WANTED to die. My stomach was empty, and I was dry heaving for at least an hour before A finally got me to drink water. I couldn't walk. I couldn't dance. I was completely out of my mind. I felt like I was going over the edge. I was miserable. The last thing I remember is a girl I'd never seen before holding my hand and asking one of my friends if I was going to be okay. It was 3:30 before I regained consciousness. I was lying on the couch where my friends had recently been. They now gathered around me, giving me water and hiding me from the view of the random security that had already asked twice if I needed to go to the hospital. People I didn't know came and went, everyone taking turns taking care of me, because I couldn't take care of myself. The party came and went. I was carried out to the car at 6:30 by a group of my friends, because I still couldn't walk. In the car someone gave me sleeping pills so I could sleep it off. I woke up the next day at 7:30 at night.Lesson learned? I no longer do acid or ecstasy, although I will say I did both several times afterward. I almost died. No matter how good the high, it's not worth the price I almost paid.Exp Year: 1998ExpID: 2795Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 29, 2000Views: 45,958    MDMA (3), LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3), Rave / Dance Event (18) DOSE: T+ 0:002 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:151 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:451 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 1:251 tabletoralMDMA(pill / tablet)BODY WEIGHT:160 lbRight now as I trying to remember what day I did my last tripping with the combination of LSD/cannabis/ecstasy.  In the cold fall of Friday, two days before Halloween, my friend (E) and I decide to go to the frat Halloween party called 'Ghost' later that night.  We also decided to get some cannabis and bought 1/8 of northern light at expensive prices from another good friend of mine (M). (Northern Light or KB is the best!) However, my other friend (D) had a couple pills of E, he wanted to sell.  I was just curious about the situation of Ecstasy because you never know you'll able to trust your friend.  I bought only one pill for myself to see if I could handle my control of the triple drug combination.  The pills were in the shape of a tablet with a 'Z' sign on it.  It looked to me that my friend (D) told me it was pure MDMA with 30mg shit. So I decided to hold on the Z pill for the party.  Before the party, my friend(E) and I was at the dorm waiting for the clock to tick-tock until the party start.  Suddenly, my friend(E) show me his acid blotters.  I told my friend(E) that we better get fuck up before the party start.  So we hit two LSD blotter.  Fifteen more minutes later, I felt nothing but a plain regular person, so we hit one more LSD again.  Thirty minutes later, my friend(E) told me that he was getting buzz for now.  i felt the same way he has.  We both were sitting on the couch with our head drooping down.  I told my friend(E) to take another shot and we hit one LSD blotter.  At that time, I felt my head was pounding inside of my head, trying to pound out of my head. My sensation was not right as normal.  My heart was pounding louder and louder.  I was totally freaking out.  My friend(E) told me that he was seeing things like shit.  He pointed out and told me that he saw something in the '3-D' pattern on the cushion.  My eye pupil was fucking wide open and I was getting paranioa.  My friend(E) felt the same thing that I have.  He told me that everyone is rising above like hell and you will never able to focus.  We were freaking out until my friend(D) took us a ride to the 'Ghost' Halloween party.      The party was only 1 hour away and went joyriding to the party. My friend(E) was looking at the window, telling himself that he was 'seeing things'.  I was freaking out like hell and hands was shivering like hell.  My body begin to get sensation like hell.  The tingling flowing  on my skin was everywhere. Everything went so FUCK UP, that I took out my E and swallow the hit of E. After hitting the E, I closed my eyes and relaxed myself on the backseat of the car, trying to fight off the tingling flowing in my skin.  My friend(E) was pretty fuck up really bad and still he was watching the window. Suddenly, the car stop in a huge halt, and I woke up, realizing that my other friend(D) stop his car at the red light.  My heart was pounding like 6 times more than my regular heartbeat.  All of the sudden, something got my attention.  It was the light from the street lamp about 10 feet away.  Something really attract me was the light. When I look up the street light, I was only seeing the light itself, but the surrounding around light was glaring HUGE. The glare light was regular, but when I was seeing thing, it grow the glare light triple size. Very huge that my eyes was straight around the glaring light.  My mind was wiring-out and I was thinking that glaring light is like a real star!! I was freaking out and we continued to hit the road.      We arrived at the party and I was about to get out of my friend's car.  My body is tingling and weakness like hell.  I couldn't balance and control my physcial body.  My friend(E) told me that during the ride to the party, he was freaking out that way he see the car go by so fast.  So fast, the image of the car that pass us created a triple image thing.  For instance, when the pass by, it made the car blurry and you see three car pass by at the same time.  I was thinking myself what causes us seeing things different.  (I realized that I found out to be hallucination)  We went inside the frat party, realizing about 3/4 of the people at the party was wearing Halloween dress.(+3000)  My head was throbbing crazy as I walk inside the party. The music was loud and the ground was vibrating like an earthquake.  I was battling the control and hadle my mind to control my physical body.  So we party all night at the Halloween party and it was bored though like hell.  My friend(E) is already tripping out because of the loud music and vibrating.  He later became so damn nausea that he went to the restroom, vomiting like hell.  As for me, I was feeling different. I was tripping very bad. My mouth was swelling and numb. My throat was dry and I can feel 'the sands in my throat'.  I wasn't freaking out for now, and realized I'm turning to phase of mental state. I felt my mind was playing game with me.     As I reach to the mental state phase, I was sitting on the couch, closing my eyes to fight the game.  Until I heard someone called my name.   I woke up and paused, a killer with Scream mask with a knife in his hand, sitting next to me.  I was shocked to see the killer until he told me the question 'WHAT AM I?'  I looked up in his eyes outside of the mask.  I was freaking.  My heart was pounding like hell against my chest.  When I looked through that mask , I feel that he was A REAL KILLER. I was looking through the mask, seeing things.  His eyes was like angry and fear and my eyes was totally focused on this person's eyes. I was seing the real thing in the other world.  Later, the mask turn out to be my other friend(D) who was laughing at me.  I was totally freaking out and trying to focus my mind.  I decide to hit five hits with the northern light with my glass bong outside.  After getting hit, I went back inside the party and social with my friend.  My eyes was completely wide-open and my body still throbbing alittle like a scarecrow.  I was seeing too much, my throat and lip was dry, and eyes is still throbbing like hell.  When I join up to social with other friend, I was thinkng of myself trying to say something to social with the people.  Actually, I haven't spoke a single word.   I was a sitting duck.  The voice of the people's talk increased so loud and everything was 'flashing' 'slow motion'. I was seeing things that are different but they're not there. The people's face was different when I look them in the faces.  I paused myself, continuing to battle your way out to find out.  The face of the people was STRECHING, creating human-reptile form.  I was scared like shit!!!!My eyes wouldn't blink because my eyes was focusing on the people's focus. I was losing the control of my mind because I let it go easily. I was losing the 'reality'.     I was little worning out, and so my friend(E).  We sat on the couch, and I was 'crashing'.  The most lovely experience was battling the game against my mind. It pretty interesting because I feel that I want to win the damn battle and force myself to overcome my mind.  I called it 'MindGame', where you stuggling to battle to win the game.  My friend(E) and me starting to talk, smoking few weeds.  We was talking longer and longer than we can imagine.  We were talking about the past and back in school.  And still, it like 3;30 am in the morning and still we continued to chat.  Oh man, my head was pounding against my brain.  My throat is so damn dry, that it begging for water.  I was very weak to make the move.  When we were chatting together, everything change.  I wasn't listening to my friend(E)!  Everything is so FUCK UP because I was very confusing what was going on.  I was thinking too much. I was thinking myself in the other reality which didn't belong here.  My head is mind controlling my move to make me see thing,do thing, and hear things.  It was so freaking out and I feel pretty damn lighten up.  I was scary, shivering, and nervous. Everything started to blank out.  I was troubling breathing back and forth.  I felt that someone was playing with my head, no wonder how or whatever it controlled my head.  Everything went fuck up that I couldn't take anymore.  I was trying to control myself to fight back the 'game' in order to defense myself.   The drugs is little worn out but we went back to the dorm.  My head and my eyes was throbbing.  The music in the car double it sound,louder than I can imagine.  During the joyriding, I felt real-life setting.  I was thinking about the negative thoughts. I was scary like hell.  Because if you in the phase of 'crashdown', you are FUCK UP.  A small problem can make me worry too much and nevous.  Sometimes I was thinking about the past, I was scary and hurt.  If you have a best friend at the party, and your friend was drunk and wanted to leave, how would you feel?  To me, I will think about the future what going to happen to my friend.  Sometimes I get worried about my friend or back home.  Sometime you feel a small conflict is no big deal, but YOU FEEL THAT IT REALLY A BIG DEAL!!!  Sometimes i was confusing and thinking too much, I get that shitface all the time.  It the mindgame that really fuck up my real mind.   I couldn't feel the car couch because I felt NOTHING AT ALL.  For instances, one way was I was thinking too much to focus.  But while I'm at that point, something sneak up behind and controll your mind.  The reality which make the deadly game to turn the head around.  Everything you see is fuck up, and tommorrow will never be the same.  And I feel that I want to get the hell outta of here that all.     We got back to the dorm and I went to bed like that quick.  the next day, I woke up realizing everything was okay.  Still my whole body is weak and my throat is still dry.  I will never forget the mindgame.  You have to make the move to control the game by winning or beating the mind.  I will never forget about what we have done here.  Everything is jus the deadly game of reality.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 3545Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 30, 2000Views: 12,350    MDMA (3), LSD (2) : Various (28), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), Combinations (3) DOSE:4 hitsoralLSD(liquid)BODY WEIGHT:160 lb15 out of 35 of us that went on a haunted hayride ate the wicked liquid.  15 of us have not been the same since.

I have always been the type of person who does their drugs, that night the drugs did me.  I almost lost it.  I have never blacked out from lsd before, and that night there are hours i dont remember.  Everyone who ate it tripped for over 24 hours.  I my case it was 48.  I fell asleep and when i woke up i was still tripping. I watched some of my friends freak out.  Others would try to talk them down but we all found that we could not find the words to exprese the thoughts in our heads.  My body was twitching my eyelids were fluttering.  It was ruthless.  I never thought i was going to come down.  My friend S almost drowned in the shower.  When i took one i knew that water was hitting my body but it didnt feel like i was getting wet.  We all call it the wicked liquid, for this reason...what is in such a minute drop of liquid that can freak out 15 adults?  For all of you reading this I dont know what strain of liquid it was so if asked if you want some liquid lsd, think twice.  Liquid USED to be my favorite type of LSD.

My parents had a camper at this park that they kept there all year round, as did a couple of my friends' parents. Me and 5 of my friends decided to do acid that day. They started, dropping 2 hits each at noon. I had to bring my girlfriend at the time home from work at 3:30, so I decided to wait until later that night to take my 2 hits. I left my girlfriend's around 10 pm and headed to the campground. From what my friends told me, they had had a very intense trip, swimming, puking, laughing, hallucinating, and pretty much the normal trip. By the time I arrived they were coming down. We came to the conclusion that we should all do 2 more together, since I had just gotten there. My friend J. decided that he'd have to take 4 becuase he had taken two earlier in the day and it wouldn't affect him if he only took 2, and the others all took between 3 and 4 more. After an hour or so we started to trip. J. decided that he needed to go get some OJ. He took off running for a store that was about 2 miles away and from what he said he didn't stop until he got there. By the time he got back I was tripping hard. Speech was slurred and incomprehensible and I was getting pretty scared. Nothing (any spoken word) was making any sense. I was starting to get very panicked and freaked out. I kept asking my friend D., 'what the fuck is going on???' and he'd answer ' I dont' know,' like that was going to make me feel better. We decided to go for a walk since we were about the only ones in the park. You have to remember that this is around midnight and pitch black in the middle of the woods. Just as we were about to leave, one of our friends came back totally panicking...saying that she was in the bathroom shower when she heard something growl at her. We decided to go for a walk to find whatever growled at her. As we started to enter the woods it got blacker and blacker until we could see absolutely nothing, not even the sky becuase the brush and trees were so thick. We really started to get scared that we were lost when we were running into trees and shit. We were all starting to panic and we were holding on to each other to try to find our way out of the woods...when we found the lake that was only about 100 feet from our camper. I don't remember who had the idea to go swimming, but I was just so glad to know where I was that I forgot all about being scared. I decided that yeah, a swim might feel good, but you have to remember it was October in the Atlantic Ocean...and you don't realize how cold it is because you are so hot from the acid. Let me tell you one thing that you never want to do is swim in frigid water on acid. After I finally got in and got used to the cold, going under was something else. I got totally lost, no sense of direction whatsoever and it was just fucked up. I was practically crying when we got out and back to the camper. All my clothes were wet, I was fucked up, didn't know how long this was going to last and by then, it was 6am. I had to go pick up my girl in 2 hours to bring her to work...and I was tripping hard. Needless to say, I was in no shape and the trip freaked me out so much I haven't touched acid since.Exp Year: 1998ExpID: 1020Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Dec 14, 2000Views: 14,168    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Bad Trips (6) DOSE: T+ 0:005 hitsoralLSD(liquid)  T+ 4:303 hitsoralLSD(liquid)BODY WEIGHT:135 lbIt was ritual really... every weekend, Kaylie and I 'take a trip' and temporarily leave reality.  Its our thing.  Usually 2 or 3 hits... no more. Maybe its frowned upon and what not... but we do it religiously.Last weekend, there was some hard-core RAINBOW acid goin around.  My friend Barrett had a bought a vial.  The guy he got it from had said, 'you really don't want to take more than 3 at a time or your ass will fry.'  Regardless, B. dropped 5 on my tongue, as well as Kaylie's 4. (2 pm)  At the time we were all at John's house.  He had eaten 6 directly before we did. Kaylie and I decided to go the mall and grub at Chik Filet before it kicked in and then we intended on going back to John's.  I wasn't really feeling anything like anxiety prior to eating it.  I was actually pretty casual about it and tried not to think about it so it would hit me hard when it 'snuck up on me.'I was hungry as hell.  It was 2:30 when we sat down to eat.  In a couple of minutes I felt alot of tightness in my jaw and my fries looked kind of... glossy?  A damn 35 minutes- it hit me hard... I wanted to hit it back.  We threw away our food, unable to eat.  I was so f***ing giddy and I was laughing uncontrollably.  Leaving the mall, Kaylie and I ran into my friend Amanda.  I gave her a hug and whispered, 'I'm tripping my balls off.'  She goes, 'yeh, I can tell. calm down.'I don't remember the drive back to John's house. [Erowid Note: it is extremely irresponsible to plan to drive while high.]  When we got back, there were about 9 people and everyone was on the same shit.  I felt much more comfortable then.  I laid on the floor in front of a fiber optics lamp.  Kaylie suggested we find some Ecstacy and 'candy flip.'B. said if I rode with him he could hook us up with some killer X.  I really didn't want to.  My mind was racing, I was skipping words in my sentences, and I was not too swift on my feet because I was visualizing piles of sunglasses all over the floor and I did not want to step on them.  For some reason I didn't think I could function unless some one else was with me, telling me what to do- so I didn't want to leave Kaylie.  All of that in addition to the fact that B is a terrible driver and sweat was rolling down his face after dropping 7 hits in his eye.Being a damn fool I consented.  He drove like a f***ing lunatic.  B. had to make a few stops to sell and pick up a girl.  The X fell through.  It pissed me off because I didn't want it to wear off and by then we were claiming it the 'best acid we've ever had.'  I sat waiting in the back of his jeep and convinced myself  to take more.  (6:30 pm)  He sold me 3 more hits (I took them promptly) and I got 2 more for Kaylie.  We all went back to John's and smoked out in his garage.  I was light headed, dizy, and I felt like I was watching myself.The most random and distorted thoughts ran through my head about myself, life, and everyone else there.  I kept slipping in and out of reality and sort of having dreams with my eyes open and I was unaware of movement and sound around me.  Barrett stumbled into the garage...'Theres a f***ing house on fire!!'  No one paid real attention to what he had said.  A couple people ran out to look.::I'm drawing a blank right here.::  I remember riding in the back seat of Matt's car with Evan and Kaylie.  I saw it.  I saw the house.  Masses of cop cars, firemen, and people taking pictures grew around it.  It depressed me.  I stood alone watching it.  It was sad, but we couldn't turn away from it.  I was confused... I wasn't sure it was acctually there.  My thoughts were interupted by a gas explosion.  Some one grabbed my arm and escorted me back to the car.From then on I could barely clear my head.  Schizophrenia took over me.  I spoke when spoken to -- which was not often.  Most everyone kept to themselves.  It was about 11.  Kaylie and I pulled ourselves away from the party.  The drive home was silent.  The road turned into a steep cartoon road with a smiley face sun.  It was a short ride home.  When we got there my uncle was there.  I didn't ask why.  Kaylie and I went upstairs and my whole body was shaking and going into mild convulsions.  Within a few minutes my uncle came upstairs.  I didn't move.  (I thought maybe he wouldn't see me.)  I couldn't look him in the eye.  He began talking about something... I don't know.  I saw him speak... but my thoughts drowned out his voice.  He left.  The rest of the night was a blur.  The next morning I was confused and scared.  I wasn't sure if the fire had acctually happened.  Kaylie told me that I scared the hell out of her and I was rambling about waffles and cops.  I don't know exactly what triggered my 'bad trip'.  Take it for what its worth.  I will probably not trip again, and if so it will be a long time.  And everyday I'm reminded of it when I drive by the burnt-down house.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 4253Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Dec 16, 2000Views: 7,084    LSD (2) : Various (28), Bad Trips (6) BODY WEIGHT:140 lbI began experimenting with LSD when I was maybe 14 years old, shortly after I began attending high school.  For the first while everything seemed to be okay.  I had the odd bad trip, but I always chalked it up to not being in a good frame of mind when I first dosed, and anyone who had experience with the drug will know how a bad mood or an undo amount of stress can be magnified exponentially while tripping out.When at 15 I left home permanently and moved to the street, the amount of drugs I began abusing became staggering.  At first acid and PCP were my main drugs of choice, although later I moved on to cocaine, meth, heroin and crack.  While I never became overly dependent on any of these drugs (with the exception of heroin, where I had a short-term addiction that lasted approximately 6 months and then I was able to kick, luckily for good).  But I digress.  Acid was becoming the drug I returned to more and more.  By the time I was 16 years old, dosing 20 to 30 hits worth of liquid was becoming a normal routine for me.The bar we frequented when I was younger was a hangout for a number of the acid dealers that hung out in my particular scene, and at the end of a night they would often pour the leftovers of the sheets they'd been laying into our pitchers of beer, sometimes seventy-five to a hundred hits at a time, split between 5 or 6 people.  So large doses of LSD became very common.The experience that completely turned me off of the drug was about 4 years ago, when a friend of mine showed up in the park where me and a couple of other guys were hanging out with a swish bottle filled with about three hundred hits of liquid mixed with some Gatorade.  The four of us decided to split the bottle up and trip around the city for an evening.  We passed the bottle around, taking sips (that's why I say approximately 75 hits as the dose I took, because I'm just splitting the 300 hits four ways... I suppose it could have been 50 I drank, or 100, it's impossible to know for sure).  Within 45 minutes I was higher and more out of my mind than I'd ever been in my entire life (and I was no amateur when it came to drug abuse).  By the time I was peaking hours later, I was unable to move, speak or comprehend events occuring around me in even the usually disjointed way a person is able to when tripping on a more tolerable dose.  Visual hallucinations, which up until then had consisted of the usual trails and breathing walls and such, were now intensified to such a degree that I was seeing real live solid things that absolutely did not exist in reality.  Having conversations with real people that weren't there, watching buildings collapse around me, etc. etc...very similar to experiences I've heard described to me by avid peyote users (although I've never tried it myself).Now, I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who have experienced the kind of horrible trip where you're convinced you are not going to ever come down off the drug (the kind where, as soon as you start to come down, you realize how silly you were for ever thinking otherwise, yet the underlying terror remains).  Now, imagine this multiplied a hundred-fold.  I was so completely out of my mind that suicide began to look like a very viable, even pleasurable, option, not because of any depression or lack of will to live, but simply to make the trip end.  I remember bashing my head against a wall at one point to try and knock myself unconscious.  Eventually, after 14 hours or so, I began to come back to my senses (although the residual effects lasted for about another twenty or so hours after that).  Anyway, this experience completely destroyed my ability to have a good time doing acid, permanently.I did try the drug a couple of more times afterwards, always only one or two hits, and still I was always brought back to that same horrible trip, less intense, of course, but just as frightening.  My ability to control my frame of mind while tripping out was totally shot, and I haven't touched the drug in a little over 3 years, because when it ceases to be enjoyable, and you spend your whole trip wishing you hadn't dosed in the first place, then what's the point, right?  I don't suppose there's a moral to this story, or even a direct message, you can take from it what you like.  I don't want to say not to try the drug, because when I WAS able to handle it, I had some amazing revelations and even the odd life-changing experience.  Just be careful.Exp Year: 1996ExpID: 1120Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 15, 2001Views: 6,791    LSD (2) : Various (28), Bad Trips (6), Retrospective / Summary (11) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:105 lbI was at a rave with a few friends and we all decided to buy some felix blotter acid. I dropped both hits around 1:15am. I had a great body high. I had an amazing amount of energy and i couldn't sit still. At this point, i wasn't hallucinating yet. I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off. I couldn't stop dancing, i had to keep moving. The dj was spinnin' a creepy trance track that made me think psychotic. I was nobody's friend, not even my own, but i was still moving. I didn't want anyone to touch me. It seemed as though everyone was against me and nobody cared. I didn't understand the whole scene, questions like...Why do i do this to myself? Why do people enjoy LSD? Why would anyone like to not be able to tell the difference between a dream and reality?That's when i stopped myself and tried to figure out who i was, why i'm here, what did i take and things like that...but i just didn't know. Right there everything hit me. The bad trip started to take over. I felt as though i couldn't control myself, but i just kept moving. After thinking like that for about 45 minutes and dancing, i sat down next to a huge brick wall. I lit up a cigarette and looked at the wall. The bricks were spelling words out, like Death, End, Over, and i closed my eyes, shook my head, looked at the wall again and there were 6 bears dancing in a cirle with sharp teeth just grinning at me, and then i realized how fucked up i was. I jumped up and ran over to a fence and grabbed onto it and just stood there. That fence seemed to bring me to reality, like when i was holding that fence, nothing could hurt me. It was like that fence was sobriety and reality - it was really there, it was the only thing that i knew was real. I looked around and everyone looked like crazy fools running around. It seemed like a riot. Through my eyes, it was total chaos, but it was really a bunch of people just enjoying themselves at a party. I was horrified when people would try to talk to me. Their skin would look disgusting, their voices would give me chills. Then the psychotic thoughts came back. I was thinking to myself, maybe all these people are in a cult and this is a gathering. Maybe they just advertised this gathering as a party to get people to come here and get all fucked up and then eat their brains or some shit. I would look around and everyone seemed to be watching me. I couldn't handle it, i had to leave. I stood up, lit a cigarette and started walking. I stared at the ground while i was walking. The grass looked like a bunch of pins waiting to prick me. It was a horrible night and i still don't remember everything or what happend after i stood up. I don't remember where i went or who with, but i guess that's something you should expect when you take a psychoactive drug like LSD. So, if you're gonna trip, know what you're in for and be careful.Exp Year: 1999ExpID: 319Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 3, 2001Views: 13,029    LSD (2) : Rave / Dance Event (18), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:2 tabletsoralUnknown(pill / tablet) 1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:130 lbFrom the day I started using drugs my life changed. About a year and a half ago I took my first pill of Ecstasy at a rave in Oakland, and had a blast, and I guess between now and then I have done E at least 50 or 60 times. I usually always had a great time except when I went to Cyberfest, a massive rave, in June of this year. Planning to roll I had brought 2 pills of Ecstasty with me, both of them being four leaf clovers or 'shamrocks' I had got from home. Pills had always taken around an hour or so to kick in for me, so I was ready to take my pill around 11:45 with a few of my friends. I had also obtained a hit of LSD, something I have also done at least 70 or so times. I've never had a bad trip in all my times of doing either ecstasy or acid, so Cyberfest was certainly a surprise to me. One of the pills I had taken was crushed and I hadn't eaten much that day but I was surprised when no less than 10 minutes later I began to feel fucked up. I had gone down a slide and when I got to the bottom I knew something definantly wasn't right. I had to sit down to put my shoes back on and then a few friends and I made our way to the bathrooms. While my friends took care of their business I sat down and thoughts began running through my head the something wierd was happening, it was all hitting me way too fast and way too hard, I kept thinking 'I'll be ok, I just dont want to be one of those people who ends up having siezures and convulsing on the ground with crowds standing around them,' that just wasn't me. After my friends had finished we all got up and started to head over to the drink stand and then make our way back across the fairgrounds to where our towns meeeting spot was (the ravers in my city are all pretty close). We got a drink and I told one of my close friends that I was way too fucked up and felt as if I was going to have trouble walking, then I did. Half way to the other side I had to stop and sit down. Whenever I would open my eyes everything was really blurry, I couldn't focus and things were just moving from side to side. My legs felt so weak that a couple of my friends picked me up and helped me out of the way of traffic to the metting place. I dont remember everything that happened for about 3 or 4 hours of the night, something that also has never happened to me. I had to sit down for a long time with my knees up and my head down. I felt safe as long as I had a friend close by. I felt as if I was a inconvience having to be babysat but I knew without them I would have become lost. I thought I was going blind because opening my eyes and focusing was almost immposible. When I would stand up I had no balance and would shake back and fourth becasue my feet felt as if they were 3 inches long and I would try to touch the ground because I felt as if I was down on my knees. Since I had no balance I just had to sit there. After a few hours of that I began to regain my vision, the LSD I had taken early was still hitting me so I was full of energy. After I shook it off I was fine and frying pretty hard still. It was definintly an experiance I wouldn't want to go through again. I knew something must have been wrong with the pills I had taken because 2 was about average and I had never had anything even close to that happen to me. I knew that I just had to maintain and stay awake. It hit me really hard and was a strange feeling of being out of control of my body which I didnt like. I hadn't heard about DXM or bad news about the clovers at that time but I know now and would spread the word not to take them.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 2841Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 9, 2001Views: 23,835    LSD (2), MDMA (3), DXM (22) : Rave / Dance Event (18), What Was in That?

I have never shared what I felt that night, and don't ever plan to, for fear of unwanted judgement from friends and possible rejection.I have tripped and rolled numerous times before, resting on the assumption that a 'bad trip' could NEVER happen to me. Little did I know, it was exactly the opposite - it COULD happen to ANYONE. I was having such a kick-ass time with psychadellic drugs that I figured that if it was going to happen, it would have already. This thought almost made me feel invincible..My friend and I prepared for what we normally do on Saturday nights - club-hop on South Beach. (For those not aware of the Miami atmosphere, it's basically a strip with clubs literally door to door extending about 10 streets down; the main streets jam-packed with people ranging from each end of the social status bar, creating a perfect opportunity for unpredictable nightlife behavior.) This time, however, we each dropped a geltab.We were both hesitant at first, but were forced to accept it once the gelly dissolved in our mouths. Regret began to sink in as we walked along unfamiliar territory. I felt bad vibes from every person we walked passed - possibly because trails extending outward from their heads caused them to look like the devil. It seemed real at the time. The sound of chanting monks faded in and out of my ear creating this idea that we have now entered a forbidden town and someone would make sure we knew we were unwelcome -  or at least, that I was.I experienced extreme paranoia and feared for my life, but had no logical explanation. If a guy seemed interested in me and approached me, I truly believed he wanted to kidnap me, beat me or take advantage of me. A thought, under normal sober circumstances, would sneak in and out of your mind as you pleased, was now trapped and enhanced by the LSD, making you undoubtingly believe it was true.Our night consisted of dramatic twists and turns. We almost got into a fight with two other girls, not entirely sure if they said what they said in a fight-provoking manner. Who knows, but we managed to ignore them and walk on. Then, we met up with some male friends of ours and got into their car. I was peaking by now, and so was my paranoia, so I thought they were kidnapping us. 'We gotta hotel for ya'll, don't worry,' he says, as I hear the doors lock and windows shoot up. I demanded we be dropped off at the main street and we would go from there.I guess you could say the trip started off on the wrong foot, but it's only just begun. We ran into our server and his friend C. A sigh of relief. C and I really don't get along, but who cared, he was a familiar face.We wound up leaving the Beach with them and chilling at C's apartment. (Last weekend, my friend and I tripped with C and another dude. C annoyed the shit out of me, and completely blew my trip. He insisted on 'getting to know eachother', I don't know.) I was hoping we wouldn't have a repeat of that ugly episode. Before the night even began, I told my friend whatever ends up happening tonight, I do NOT want to chill with C. He wasn't someone I would particularly want to hang out with, let alone trip with.My friend and the server had to go take care of some business in Downtown Miami. C and I were left alone. He offered me what looked like a pretty big blue pill. 'Take it, it's a roll.' I don't remember what I was thinking at this point, but I snatched it and swallowed it. Within a matter of minutes, I felt the effects.I was reminded of the feeling of euphoria and sensations like no other emerged from all over my body. Visuals were enhanced with a shift of an eyeball. Trails of defined colors danced in front of me as if a painter were swirling her brush. It was nice.Moments later, the mood changed. I began to feel scared. I wanted out of the trip and out of the house. C was sitting next to me on the couch with his eyes closed. HE was causing to me feel this way. (It's difficult to put in words, but) The feeling was as if he were penetrating through my mind and invading my personal thoughts. As his eyes kept shut, I could mentally feel our minds becoming one and my privacy no longer existed. I was frantic and nervous, at the same time trying to maintain my composure and trying to reassure myself that it wasn't real. But I was totally convinced this was reality and there was no escaping it. Fear was the center of this world and I  was its prisoner. I never knew a personal hell existed - mine was forming before me. They took over me. There was an overwhelming sense of negativity in my head and I couldn't stop it. I tried to think of a happy place many times, but they wouldn't allow it as I would be punished for attempting.I looked over at C, eyes still shut. I persistently begged him to open his eyes, as the mental torture would stop when he did so. Eyes remained shut. 'Please, please open your eyes C. Just stop it. Why-' He finally opened them. It took me by surprise, and was grateful that he did. Just when I thought he had understood and would comfort me in this time of need.. 'I'm sorry,' he mumbled and closed them once again. My mental hell resumed its normal course. He wasn't touching me, barely even talking to me. What the fuck are you going through, I would ask myself. Hopelessness, fear, lonliness and anger all came crashing down at me. And not knowing what the fuck was happening to me just added to my frustration. All I knew was that I never felt like such a piece of shit in my entire life. I had no control over my thoughts whatsoever and I was beginning to accept that. I soon let him in, and allowed him to do what he wished. As I sat in moral anguish, I noticed the glare from my cell phone stuffed between the cushions. I saw a chance. As I dialed the number to my friend's phone, I began to feel this magnetic energy pulling me toward C. It seemed as if I've just angered someone or something and it was telling me to put the 'fucking phone down.' Somehow, I managed to connect. 'Hello.' Her voice was like the dim light at the end of my dark tunnel. I was extremely relieved to hear someone from another world who knew who I was and could possibly understand my situation. While I was on the phone with her, I couldn't bring myself to explain what was happening. What if she thought I was crazy? What if she took his side, instead of mine? 'Nevermind. Just..hurry up.'Tears slowly ran down my cheeks. (I don't care what anybody says, but it seemed real as hell at this point, because I for one, am not a crier.) 'C, please, open your eyes,' as my voice cracked. I was mentally exhausted and my heart was rapidly beating. Every negative and evil thought, idea and belief known to humanity rested in my conscience. I could slowly feel my values, morals, and faith relinquish in a matter of seconds. I wanted to ball up and crawl into my mother's arms.Finally, I heard footsteps scurrying up the stairs. I jolted up and ran to the door. C quickly followed and beat me to my spot. 'Did I do something wrong?' I shoved him out of the way and flung the door wide open. My friend insisted I tell her what happened, and not quite sure how to answer, the first thing that came to mind was, 'I trolled balls.' I hauled ass down the steps and into the car. The ride home was even more weird. The server sat in the back seat, me in the front and my friend drove. I noticed he was on the phone and suddenly I assumed it was C - trying to take over my mind again. I literally freaked out and tried to wrestle the phone out of his hand. He resisted and stared at me as if I were crazy. Now, I thought he was in on it too; my friend then implied I shouldn't touch him (At that time, my friend and the server were seeing eachother.) So I sat there, all fucked in the head, feeling insane and alone. I was later told I attempted to jump out of the car while in motion. We pull up in front of my house. I start to panic. My friend suggests I take a xanax bar to calm myself down and fall deep into sleep. I hear an echoing voice in my head, C, agreeing I should, so he could fuck with my head while asleep. After what seemed like hours of convincing, she turned the car around. We then dropped the server off.We sat in front of her house. She assured me that everything would be fine. She wouldn't go anywhere until I was ready to go inside. I was finally feeling a level of comfort. It was about 8 or 9 in the morning, not too sure. She fell asleep as I sat there wondering why me? I glanced over to the side view mirror. She looked like me, but it wasn't. Her  pupils were dialated and her eyebrows wrinkled displaying a worried look. I was still catching mad visuals, but the mental ride was coming to an end. Nature reminded me of my true reality - my loving family, school, work. The sun pressed tightly against my face. Leaves rattled in the wind and birds were singing more magically than usual. The grass was tainted a rich green and the sky a perfect shade of blue.  I felt as if I were just stripped of my pride and dignity and suffered the humiliations of a rape victim.I awoke my friend and told her I was ready to go and rest. Tired, she went to her room and slept. I laid in the couch with my eyes still wide open. I'll try to explain as best as I can in words what I was about to embark upon..Suddenly, this surge of mental energy overcame me. Physically, it felt as if my brain were being cleansed and massaged. Every doubt I've ever had about anything and everything soon came clear to me. A higher existence guided me along this path to Seventh Heaven. I was revealed a place where my prejudices and judgements of people no longer existed, a place where love conquered all; a place where words couldn't apply meaning, but instead your soul justified your innocence; a place of truth - no questions, faith - no doubts. HE then spoke to me. Love and appreciate your mom; look after your brother and sister; spend time with your grandma (one after the other) Do what you love in life and go into the entertainment business; don't mess with drugs you can't handle..Just like that.. for the first time, not that day, but in my entire life, I felt at peace. It sounds so unbelieveable, but everything was so crystal clear to me. The revelation changed my perspective on everything, maturing my mind and bringing me closer to God - putting my utmost faith in something I once doubted it existed. In the end, I found myself again - happily reunited with my soul. They say everything happens for a reason. Mine may have been to receive 'the message-', so I guess I'm hanging up the phone.(To L, my friend, THANK YOU.)Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 6375Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Apr 21, 2001Views: 14,249    MDMA (3), LSD (2) : Various (28), Mystical Experiences (9), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), Combinations (3) DOSE:4 hitsoralLSD(gel tab)BODY WEIGHT:300 lbHello!  My name is Sam.  I'm 27 years old and I have been using LSD and other entheogens for about 18 months.  I've been reading a lot lately about 'bad trips'.  I've even heard about a couple from aquintances.  Most of these tales go a little like,  'I took a lot of acid this one time and I had a really bad trip...I don't even want to talk about it...so I'm never taking acid again.  I'll just stick with pot.'I'm really at a loss.  Let me first explain my experience with this 'bad trip' phenomenom.  I have had two so-called bad trips on LSD.  The first was on four geltabs.  A friend and I went to the bar where we work after hours all by ourselves.  It's a local nightclub and we figured it would be a great place to trip.  We fired up the DJ booth and set in with some serious jungle/breakbeat techno.  The first two hours went fine.  We experienced the initial grip of the beast...intensity.  Then we moved on into the chatting stage.  We discovered undeniable truths together and sharpened our 'acid wit' on each other.  Then we went our separate ways as was par for the course so far.  I found myself sitting on a couch contemplating my little world and I began to sink.  That's the only way I can explain it.  I felt I was sinking.  The music was just pummeling me.  It was hard, dirty and nasty and so was I.  I kept sinking further, and I began to physically sink into the couch and all this music was on me.  All I could think was how dirty and nasty I was as a person.  I thought it would never end, but I held on.  When the music was over it was gone...like that.  All I could remember was sitting on the couch and feeling a maternal figure showing me a mirror.  This figure was forcing me to deal with myself, and it did so with the same love and temperament that a mother would in teaching her child to tie his shoes.  After that, all I could do was smile and the rest of the trip was the best I'd ever had.The second bad trip was almost identical.  Same dose, but I was at home and my friend had already passed out.  I, however, was still going strong.  I decided it would be a good idea to watch the movie '8mm'...bad call!  The 'bad trip' was similar, I felt like I was sinking and the movie made feel dirty, but it was intensified tenfold.  I couldn't get away from the movie...even when it ended.  I went to my bed because it was the only place in my house I felt safe.  I wrapped myself in a sheet careful not to let anything but the sheet touch me.  I tried to sleep, but a waking nightmare kept me awake and forced me to endure all that it had to offer.  I was finally relieved by the mercy of unconsciousness.  When I awoke I felt as good as I ever had.  I felt purged.These 'bad trips' are the best memories I have of LSD.  I don't understand how people can't love them for what they can teach us.  I believe LSD opens doors that normally remain closed, for whatever reasons, and force us to deal with the skeletons that live there.  Then you don't have to be imprisoned by them anymore.  I believe people who quit using LSD because of 'bad trips' are probably using the drug for the wrong reasons in the first place.  I hate even using the term 'bad trip'...I call them 'the real trip'.Now, I don't mean to belittle any other entheogens, but LSD isn't for everyone and maybe some people should stick with the less intense variety. But, LSD has a special place in my heart.  LSD is my goody goody.  LSD is the Daddy.  But I will say that I can't wait until I get my grubby hands on some DMT.  'If acid is a slow, strange trip, DMT is like gettng shot out of a cannon'...I can't wait for that.SamuelThursday 18, May 20004:23 A.M.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 1497Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 27 Published: May 19, 2001Views: 50,772    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Bad Trips (6), Retrospective / Summary (11) DOSE: T+ 0:00300 mgoralPharms - Venlafaxine(daily)  T+ 0:00200 mgoralPharms - Fluvoxamine(daily)  T+ 0:0040 mgoralPharms - Ziprasidone(daily)  T+ 0:002 hitsoralLSD(edible / food)  T+ 7:003 shotsoralAlcohol - Hard BODY WEIGHT:150 lbAnti-Depressants and Halucigenics[might be worth adding the pharms... I find reports of combinations like this interesting.  your call, tho.  --scruff]I've always told myself that if I were to use drugs, it wouldn't be something light like marijuana, it would be hard-core, maybe acid or coke. I have never been big on drugs, but I am a psychadelic girl. Not too long ago, I was in the hospital for depression and anger. The result: 300 mg of Effexor, 200 mg of Luvox, and 40 mg of Geodon each day. Keep in mind that I am making a complete hypocrite of myself by being on all these medications. A couple of guys, who I had met at a party, and most of which have criminal records, calle  me up and asked me if I wanted to trip off acid. After serious contemplation, I agreed. On a Sunday, at about 10 AM, I took a hit of LSD, on a sweet tart (supposedly 2 regular hits, or two drops, as if it were 2 blotters). My trip was very diminished due to my medications, and I am thankful for that My trip was very diminished due to my medications, and I am thankful for that. At about 5 PM, I was taking shots of whiskey, I had about 3. Drinking on LSD was great. If I thought I could feel a body buzz before, I was ignorant. I had read as much as I could, but in the end I wasn't prepared. At the end of the night, I was wigging out. I was convinced I was going to get raped within a month, that everyone hated me, and that I was dying from what I called 'seperation of the wrist'. I was frightened. I voluntarily set myself up for yet another mental collapse. To this day I do not know how pure the drug I took was, and what other than LSD it contained. All I have is the damage, which are diminished coordination, head rushes, poor adjustment to heat, etc. Studies need to be done on the effects of other drugs in combination with anti depressants and anti-psychotics.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 7973Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jul 10, 2001Views: 2,257    Pharms - Venlafaxine (191), Pharms - Fluvoxamine (297), Pharms - Ziprasidone (353), LSD (2) : Retrospective / Summary (11), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Depression (15), Post Trip Problems (8), Combinations (3), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:8 hitsoralLSD(gel tab) 2 capslsoralMDMA(capsule)Well, the trip started out beautifully.  I had taken the X a couple hours before I dropped the acid.  I was looking for a beautiful, heavenly experience.  A pure enlightnening peaceful exploration of my consciousness.  And it started out fine.  I found myself in the most beautiful trance, thinking about the future of mankind, seeing a visual map of man-made creations that are yet to come.  A map of the future.  I thought, this is what we are supposed to be'.  This is the future of mankind, beautiful colors, powerful machines, and sooo much love.  And then..My friend A came over to me, looked me in the eyes and said 'Are you okay?'  I thought.. 'Am I okay?'  then my whole world shook.  'What if I'm not okay?'  I thought..  I could sense a strong strong netted vibe that suspended between the 4 of us.  I could feel the feelings of everyone in the room, and it became clear to me that each one of us was responsible for the experience of the other.I saw something dark.  I thought, 'I can't be around these guys if I start having bad thoughts.. They must stay happy!'  So, I raced into the bathroom as the darkness began to take over my thoughts... I could no longer see what was in front of me, I was so engulfed in my thoughts.. The pure unadulterated fear that something bad is going to happen.  After 3 or 4 minutes of searching for the light switch, I came out, decided that in order to save the other 3 voyagers, I have to get out and get my head straight.  So I ran out the apartment.This voyage became the scariest thing I've ever experienced.  My mind was functioning on 2 levels, pure fear, and a voice inside my head rationalizing and trying to figure out what was going on.  Suddenly anything and everything became ugly, scary, terrifying.  The gutter, the trashbags, the road workers, the oil on the street... it all disgusted me, and I had nowhere to turn. the earth's evilness was swallowing me whole.  I pissed my pants.About this time, the other three emerge from the complex to see me darting around in fear, sock-footed, in the middle of the parking lot.  I see them, think that they're part of a cult and that I've got to get away from them.  They grab me, and a violent struggle commences.  My friends become demons dragging me into a horrible place I do not want to be.  The trip gets worse.  I begin to think that the more I struggle to be free, the better chance I have of getting in to heaven.  And then I give in for a few moments, get a glimpse of the terror of hell, and begin struggling for a positive eternity again.  They carry me into the apartment, and visions I conjured up at an early age begin appearing.  I cannot describe the fear.  They take me, and put me in the shower to hose me off (bad idea)... I see myself in the mirror, and it is covered in blood..  I see the toilet, I am disgusted to the point of puking..  I let out multiple grunts and horrible yelps.  I am being tortured in hell.  Then my first glimpse of eternity arrives.  I realize, I am here in Hell forever.  This will go on forever.  For one last instant, I give in, and submit to the demons... I see the devil, only... it looks like me.. and I can see the pure evil inside..  I let out a bloodcurdling scream, and the others in the room realize that I am experiencing something truly horrible.  Now I've got them.  I have conveyed my terror.  I am horseshit.. rejected by God.. He's so far away from me now.. I walk alone into the other room... the others try to stop me, but I let them know that I need to be alone.  I lie down.  I look at the wall.  'Oh my God.. I'm tripping.'And the true sadness and realization starts.  One of my friends comes in and asks 'Are you okay?'  I look at him and say 'I've seen the devil.  I didn't want to... but I saw him..'  He comes, lays his head on my stomach, and I realize that everything is alright.  But it won't be over for a looong time.  I have this trip embedded in my mind, and it will take years for me to forget.  It has sent me into a horrible depression that I am currently fighting.  I suffer horrible mental problems because of my experience.  My mind is stuck on seeing the bad in life.  I think about the positive, and the complete opposite arises.  If anyone else has had an experience even remotely close to this, please submit it here, and describe how you have dealt with it.I have quit all drugs... I cannot take them without them sending me off my rocker.  Why did this experience take place?  I often think I'm just a sick person.. but others tell me that it could have happened to anyone.  who knows.. I need a witness.Exp Year: 1999ExpID: 108Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jul 19, 2001Views: 32,587    MDMA (3), LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Post Trip Problems (8), Bad Trips (6) DOSE: T+ 0:0030 mgoralPharms - Paroxetine(pill / tablet)  T+ 0:595 hitsoralLSD   T+ 1:003 bowlssmokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:130 lbIt started out to be a very fun day of smoking weed. Me and my friend W were riding quads and having a great time. We had 10 hits of acid that we planned on taking at night while camping, and I was looking forward to it so much. It was a cool day, it being March, so we planned on taking lots of firewood. At around 6pm we started to get prepared to go camping. We planned on going to a very remote pond only accesible by quad. We loaded up the trailor with chairs, a CD player, firewood, 2 flashlights, and some food and drinks. We left my house to begin our journey...I had been on paxil for about 3 months for depression, and read that SSRI's like paxil will decrease the effects of acid. This is my reason for taking 5. I was experienced with high doses of acid even when I hadn't been on paxil. This night was about to get bad, real bad.We took the hits at around 11pm. We weren't very high anymore because I wanted to wait till the acid kicked in to smoke. I started feeling the stimulating feeling only 20 minutes later, so we started smoking weed. It came on so strong. Everything in my vision was moving and comical thoughts started to dance through my head. The fire's light seemed to go on forever through the woods and reflecting off of the pond. W was also feeling good. He was laughing and acting hysterical. We turned on some good techno music, I believe it was Bad Boy Bill. A few minutes later, probably 12am by then, I started to feel really out of it. Everything around me started looking alien and unfamiliar. We stopped smoking weed after the 3rd bowl, as it was clear that the pot was increasing the effects of the trip. When I closed my eyes I could see things that were going with the music. I saw a line of bamboo sticks jumping up and down with the music. It was getting really cold and I decided it would be best to drive the 2 miles back to my house. W agreed, as I could clearly see he was in distress, and looked confused. This is when the trip turned absolutely crazy. We take off running to the quad cause we are getting scared. With us, we carry the CD player and the chairs. I had parked my quad about a quarter of a mile away, because there was only a walking trail to the pond. I reached in my pocket for the key. Not there. We started to panic. Evil vibes from all directions were hitting us full speed. This is around my peak. We panic. We head back to the camp in hysteria. My visuals were getting intense and everything had a red tint to it. The trees looked like they were grabbing for me. Then W looses the flashlight. I am freaking out and W is trying to calm me down even though he is also scared. I just take off running, blindly through the woods. He screams my name to get me to come back. What I was thinking I don't know. I fell down hard about 20 feet away from W and pick up a rock. I start pouting (not like me). My friend was like aww, come on. I start hitting myself in the head with the rock. The pain was very intense. I was either severely frustrated or trying to knock myself out. I was in a different world. I remembered going camping but I didn't know why this person was here. I almost didn't know who W was, but he looked familiar. I looked at my watch and didn't understand what it meant. Then we just layed on the ground by the fire. I had lost my glasses somwhere in my self-struggle. I suddenly thought the whole woods were on fire. I jumped up and tried to pour my drink on the fire, but W stopped me. Good thing he wasn't as messed up as me. I began to think cops were going to find us, which was impossible. I asked my friend and he clarified everything. As I layed on the ground and put my head on the rock I began getting very euphoric and just thought, I am going to lay here comfortable and wait till I am sober to figure things out. I looked in the fire and saw the wires from my glasses glowing red. I am glad that was a hallucination. In the morning my brother rode his quad up to see how we were and I told him to get the spare key. He did and our asses were saved. I found my glasses and was very happy to get the hell outta there. Conclusion: My experiences with SSRI's and acid is it makes a different kind of trip. It is more intense actually but lasts slightly less. With weed, SSRI;s definately increase the high. Dont assume what you read is true, it may be true for some and not true for you. In a way I am glad I lost the key. I surely would have wrecked. Be careful, trippers, acid is not somthing to play with, it is somthing to respect.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 8357Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jul 26, 2001Views: 36,275    Pharms - Paroxetine (148), Cannabis (1), LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Nature / Outdoors (23), Entities / Beings (37), Combinations (3), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:004 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:002 tabletsoralMDMA(pill / tablet)  T+ 0:502 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:210 lbWell the night started out like the average friday night. My friend moses we will say, and I picked up some acid. In the area we are from we are use to low potency acid. It is what we expect. Well this time we were wrong. Shortly after getting the acid we arive at Mary's house. We trade some acid for some pills.We all decide to Candy flip.12:00am Mary drops 3 hits of acid and one roll. Moses drops 4 hits of acid and two rolls. I drop 4 hits of acid and two rolls. The mind set at the time was good. We were all happy to be doing such wonderful drugs.12:30am We are all starting to feel the onset of our roll. 12:50am Im starting to trip by now. Im also peaking off the pills. I decide to eat 2 more hits of acid. Mary is also begining to peak on the acid. Her roll is also peaking. Moses tells us he is trippin really hard. And he can  barely feel the pills because of the overwheling trip.1:15am Well at about this time im trippin balls. Nothing out of the ordinary. The acid also over takes my roll. By now Moses and I are very concerned with Mary. She is mumbling something like 'Im over here cuz over there isnt fun, and fun isn't over here, etc' She is also talking about wanting to die. By now Moses and I are starting to go into bad trips worrying about mary.1:25 from here on out i cannot speak for anyone else. In the next five hours the only words Moses and I said were 'Im trippin Balls.' Mary was still talking about dying. The only way to describe the rest of the trip was a severe mind fuck. I heard people throwing up in the next room. When no one else was there. People pounding on the door and walls. I also saw worms crawling under my skin. But the most frightening part of all was having my mind unravel. That is the only way to describe it. I saw things in a whole new way. All i could think is 'So this is how it is. If things dont change soon im going to kill my self' but then something inside of me said 'give it a few hours you'll be back to normal'. But then something even more shocking happened. I started to hear a voice in my head. All it said was 'in here, in here' over and over again. This went on for hours.6:00am  im starting to comedown thank god. Moses is also coming down. But mary was scaring us. She said she hasnt started coming down yet. And that she was going to trip for ever.8:00am  We all leave. Im still feeling the after affects of the acid12:00pm Im at home still feeling the acid but it no way peaking. I get a phone call. Its Mary. She asks 'Hey are you still trippin?' She sounded really scared so i say 'yeah' She Says 'good so am i'Ever since that day Mary has not been the same. She is in no way perma-trippin but she is not the same person.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 8536Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Aug 6, 2001Views: 6,943    LSD (2), MDMA (3) : Bad Trips (6), Entities / Beings (37), Combinations (3), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:1 hitoralLSDBODY WEIGHT:180 lbThis is the story of how events can turn your trip into the most nasty thing that will ever happen to you. Words can never really describe what has happened to your soul after such an event, in fact it is always hard to remember exactly how you felt as your world melts away.In England there's this festival called Glastonbury. In 1997, it was a mud bath as it was raining continuously. With this backdrop, a group of us met an LSD dealer. We all bought one each, most only took half but I was having trouble splitting it so I just thought 'sod it' and did it all. For the first three or four hours it was great, I won't go into it as everyone who has done it knows how great it can be. After a while though, I got very heavy-legged and really wanted to sit down and I also got a bit of a panic attack. I had heard that drinking alcohol was a good way to get rid of any LSD fright. The only thing available was beer, so I got a round in but most people didn't drink their beer so I had it all. Several pints. My fear was slightly subdued. We went back to this girl's tent to sit down but pretty soon I was needing a piss. So off I went to piss, but it got pretty scary on my own with the sounds becoming all strange and my vision was filled with creatures of horror and the floor was a swirling mass of mud with flashing lights reflected on it. I held it together pretty well as I had done it all before. But my head fell apart when I realised I was unable to find the tent my friends were in. The panic hit me as my legs were getting more and more heavy, I really wanted to sit down but the mud prevented me from doing so. The visuals got more intense and they got even more horrific. I kept seeing people bleeding everywhere and there was a terrible savage laughter coming from every direction. At this point I just wanted out, but as soon as you think that you've totally lost it. I had a vague idea of where my tent was, as it was near a major path, so I decided that I had to get there, that felt like safety if only I could find it. I walked through the mud and it seemed to pull me down with every step, the floor seemed to be alive. There were flashing lights everywhere, flying around my head, and the laughing had become demonic. If someone had told me the devil laughs like that I would believe them, it was that scary, that evil. I was walking up a hill and my thoughts became more crazed as I got more scared. I got to the top and a terrible stench of sh*t hit me. The rancid fumes filled my nostrils but I continued on into the field and there weren't any tents in this part of the field and it suddenly hit me that this was the field were they dumped all the sh*t from the toilets (it wasn't of course). A wave of paranoia hit me, my fear of things I was seeing was gone but I suddenly felt that every single person in the festival had made me think these terrible thoughts and scared me enough to trick me into walking into the field of sh*t. I suddenly realised that everyone was evil in ways that I could never have imagined. I continued to panic but I now wanted to show everyone that I didn't care what they had done to me. I walked and walked, constantly surpressing the urge to start screaming, and I finally found my tent. A wave of great feelings filled me and I suddenly realised how gone I had got. All the fear left me and I started to enjoy the trip for a few seconds. I even managed to laugh at my stupid thoughts from seconds before. As I got into the tent though, a most powerful smell of sh*t hit me. All the panic, all the fears filled me again. I was covered in sh*t, my clothes were covered in this rancid brown sh*t. The view that everyone was conspiring against me returned. These people were driving me mad. I stripped off and started sniffing my clothes, throwing each article out of the tent once I could not find any sh*t stains. I realised I was talking to myself, saying 'this is the worse day of my life' again and again. My friend's younger brother was in the tent and he woke up and acted very strangely (I think that he had never seen a person act so scared and so crazy), and it just confirmed that he too was in on this ruse to drive me nuts. I tried to sleep but I felt the tent was grabbing at me and strange voices were calling to me and the visions in my own head must have been sent from satan himself (well, that's how I felt as the time). I kept talking to myself. I really was mad at this point and I swore to myself that if I survived I would never do this gain. I think I was crying, it really felt like my brain and body was being savaged from within me and that I was going to die or worse. Words can never really describe what I felt, only a person who has had a terrible trip will know what I mean. It was a situation where I knew what true evil was, I could feel it all around me clawing at my soul, and everyone was involved, and I mean everyone in the world. If hell is like that, it is worse than I could have imagined before that bad trip. The story ends well though. Slowly I calmed down, and even managed to control my feeble mind enough to get dressed and go to the toilets. When daylight finally arrived, things felt good. I saw that the reason the tent smelt was because I had kicked a stray cow pat on the way into the tent, there was only sh*t on one of my shoes. I really wasn't covered in sh*t and the sun was rising for the first time that weekend. I felt reborn. I went for a walk and saw the field I had been in, it had been NEXT to the place where they put the sh*t but the field itself was fine.I swore that I would change from that point, and I did, but it still took me a long time to get over my night in hell. I would say to anyone taking LSD not to. You may have one great trip, you may have 100, but when the bad one gets you it will drive you to the point where your mind is no longer your own, and there's many people who have been mentally lost in this world.Exp Year: 1997ExpID: 8205Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Aug 7, 2001Views: 11,919    LSD (2) : Festival / Lg. Crowd (24), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:5 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:105 lbMy name is Kayla, I'm 17 years old and now sober.  I had this experience on acid; it was fucking insane. I HATE acid.  I know a lot of people that would disagree with me but this is my opinion: Acid is a very dangerous drug and you really do have to be prepared for a trip.  Anything and everything will affect it, even shit from when you were 6 years old.  I've had a really messed up life so the first time I tripped was crazy. Here's my story.....One day I was just kickin it with my friends and they invited me to a rave.  It was my first rave so I felt a little awkward there but then I saw a few friends and felt a little more comfortable. It was about 11:30pm when my friend found some acid and we decided we both wanted to trip.  We each bought 5 hits of blotter acid and took them all at once.  At about 12:15, I started feeling weird, not hallucinating, but I just wasn't comfortable and I started noticing things change, like my fingers were discolored and it looked disgusting.  My arms and wrists looked like they were bleeding everywhere and I turned to a friend and asked them if I was bleeding everywhere and they all just sat and laughed at me and told me I was, and that scared the hell out of me.  That's when I realized how fucked up I was. I started to peak an hour later, and when someone talked to me, I couldn't understand them, it sounded like they were rats and they were just squealing so I'd run away...and the bass at the party was making me think like a psycho, like how much I just wanted to kill someone or what if I die....weird thoughts kept going through my head. I didn't know what to do with myself, I started puking, I couldn't understand anyone, my arms and legs felt like they were about to fall off, I thought I was bleeding everywhere, and the worst part is, none of my friends cared.  They just laughed at me like I was their entertainment and pretending all of this.  That's all I remember from there on. I don't remember shit.  All I know is I woke up at my friend's and I was completely out of it for 3 days. I was practically delusional. I wouldn't respond if anyone said my name and I couldn't walk.  Some of the other odd things people said I did:  I tried to run through a brick wall in front of the paramedics, and I was sweating and crying for about 2 hours.  As for my friend, she was hospitalized and put into rehab for months.  The doctors said her heartbeat was going up and down so rapidly she could have died any second....I guess I was just lucky, I took the exact same acid, off the same sheet, the same amount, and we weigh exactly the same.That's my story....you might laugh, but believe me, if that was you, it wouldn't be so funny......anyway, if you're gonna do acid, do it in a safe place you're familiar with and with people that care and have done it before.  If it's your first time, know what to expect and don't take more than two hits your first time!!Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 314Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Sep 6, 2001Views: 26,345    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Post Trip Problems (8), Second Hand Report (42), First Times (2), Rave / Dance Event (18) DOSE:2.75 goralMushrooms - P. cubensis(tea) 250 ugoralLSD(pill / tablet)BODY WEIGHT:124 lbBackground: This was my first session with a career psychedelic sitter. Twelve days before, I had participated in a group ayahuasca session. A friend and I were attended by the sitter and her co-sitter, as if we were having solo sessions, but we were in the same room (setting: bedrolls, eyeshades, music in the style of holotropic breathwork). I anticipated this was going to be my first full-on high-dose ego-death session. Two days later, we were to participate in a group ayahuasca session. We met with our sitters for dinner the night before:We talked a little bit about the work we would be doing the next day and then on Saturday, with Grandmother (ayahuasca). I felt, 'this is right and good,' i.e. it was going to be safe and right for me to journey the next day with these sitters. Fast forward for a moment -- in retrospect I see that comments that were said at the table became reassuring features of the following day's journey. For example, in discussing methods for self-growth, one sitter said 'look at [such-and-such experience] as something for your toolkit.' This was a metaphor that really worked for me. A toolkit represents preparation (having all your tools ready in one place), discernment (the right tool for the right job) resourcefulness and self-reliance, all things that I value. [This may seem like a detail to which I'm attributing too much importance but it's been an important metaphor for me in processing the huge volume of information I got over the next couple of days]. The sitter suggested to us that the addition of mushrooms to the LSD grounding for an otherwise more mental journey (this is how I interpreted it, at least.) We were told to not eat anything after 9 a.m. and to be where we needed to be for our session at noon.That night, I had a frightening dream. I dreamed that I was partying with friends, in a casual setting. We were in front of a stage, but some ways away from it. In the dream, Panyin (my closest friend and co-tripper for this session, she is sometimes a companion in my dreams, too) went and did cartwheels on the stage. She was up there doing cartwheels and she fell and hit her head on a piece of machinery that was behind the curtain of the stage. She went unconscious -- the blow had been so hard that I was alarmed and had a distinct feeling that it could have been a fatal blow. I became quite concerned at what the right course of action would be -- should I call 911 immediately or should I go consult some of our medical insurance papers? (we had just received papers about a feature of our insurance that lets you call a nurse for advice over the phone). I was busy trying to decide this. And at the same time my intuition was telling me this was a dire emergency and she very well could DIE and she would be gone and that would be it. I woke up very upset. It was so disturbing that I didn't tell C when she woke up. Then I forgot about it, we ate breakfast and drove to our session. [in retrospect -- I remember had had a dream similar to this before, 7 years earlier, that deeply imprinted on me]We get to our session. The sitters have prepared comfortable bedrolls for us on the floor and are arranging the music details. Panyin and I do some stretching. I feel very serious. We sit down to have tea with our sitters and one of them asks if we had any dreams the night before. My eyes tear up. I tell my dream, feeling anxious. The sitter tells me in a matter-of-fact tone that what will probably come up for me during my journey is the ego-death stuff, 'getting out of my head' (as in getting hit on the head and going out like in the dream). I have a sinking feeling as when faced with the inevitable.When we are given mushrooms (2.5-3 grams) to hold in our hands and pray on for our intention, that sense of inevitability is even stronger. I am surprised at how much I am holding in my hand and awed at what I am about to do. I remember that my setting is perfect. I try not to think too much about it and just go with it.Someone has found a stuffed animal to put on my pillow. This is reassuring -- I had mentioned the night before that I had forgotten my own teddy bear. The sitter tells us the Rules and tells us some things we can remember to help us navigate:	1) there is a beginning, a middle and and end.	2) we all hold space on this planet -- sometimes you're in a difficult place, but it's just you're turn to be there in the 'hot spot' for a while, that's all.	3) If you find that you're lost of confused, pick an element of the music and just follow it, it will carry you and keep you moving so you don't get stuck. (now in reading this later, I don't think my sitter was a Deadhead, but this certainly sounds like a familiar message...)We sip our tea and then take the 250 mcg LSD. We lay down and put on eyeshades and earphones. I feel a little anxiety but not outright fear.Now the rest is a little hard to re-construct from my own memory. I remember not getting a whole lot of visual imagery until quite late, after the time that Panyin took a booster. It may have been about T+4:00 or so.My session's 'work' was focused on a difficult place I reached at around t+4:00 or 5. What happened before it is harder to remember; I remember listening to the music and feeling my Observer commenting on how the choice of music can affect the place a traveller is in; in retrospect I had not surrendered to the experience, nor was I resisting it, I felt deeply in it but not very very deeply. I had some insights at this phase, one was that lessons don't have to be sternly imposed; we can learn lessons by being shown things (this related to ideas about parenting and my relationship with my parents, i.e. the archetypes of Father who gives punitive lessons vs. the Mother who shows by gentle example).  I had to get up and go pee at one point and I kept my eyes closed the whole way to the bathroom (lead there by one of the sitters) because I in fact wanted to stay 'inside'. But when the sitter asked me if I wanted a booster I had trouble connecting with whether I felt 'yes' or whether I felt 'no' and giggled at the prospect. I didn't know, and because I didn't know I felt a little disappointed. The thought also briefly went through my mind, 'shit, I can't take more, I'm a coward.' [in retrospect, I can understand the thought, but I don't think I can ever be that hard on myself again] I imagined I was going to slowly come back to the straight world without bringing back much, while Panyin continued to trip next to me. But then I realized I didn't feel like more LSD was what I wanted to do. I suppose I lay back down then and put the eyeshades back on, maybe out of a feeling of resignation.The chronology of the rest of this trip is completely pell-mell because I got into timeless moments and linear time went to the background for a long while. I started to panic and it snowballed. At one point I even tried to run from the room and had to be physically restrained! I had taken off my eyeshades, and the sitter was ok with that, but after a while she suggested I put my eyeshades and said, 'there's nothing out here, go back inside.' I took notes two days later and the next few pages are derived from those notes:I was calling out loud to Gaichi (boyfriend) and to Panyin because I was in a space where I had no reference points and I really didn't know who 'I' was, all classic 'bad trip' stuff. I was trying to call to him (Gaichi) so there would be someone who recognized me and who could in turn call me back to myself. This was a difficult place where I really was seeking reassurance -- I kept asking the sitters, 'Is it OK?' and was told 'you're doing just fine, just keep breathing,' and I was having trouble remembering to do that. Then I got fragmented and confused and all this stuff was happening at once -- I couldn't remember what I was doing there in the room or why or anything. I had a vague recollection that I had taken something but even that was unclear because there was no past in that moment. I vaguely wondered 'does it look like I'm having a bad trip?' and I kept moving on past that thought because my setting was one where 'bad trip' doesn't exist [good thing, too!]. But I would wonder, 'am I supposed to try and snap out of this?' I wondered if the people around me wanted Samanthe to come back and should I comply, I couldn't tell what they wanted but I was vaguely concerned about it (my 'trying to please people' programming going strong). Panyin just couldn't stand my anguish without doing something so she came over to be with the sitters attending me. She appeared to me to be looking at me very worriedly and that scared me a little, because if *she* looked worried then there must be something wrong (this reminds me of the dream I had the night before, where I looked down worriedly at Panyin after she fell and went unconscious). I wondered if the neighbors could hear me and I clapped my hand over my mouth ('don't want to impose, don't want to do something that's bad or wrong'), because I screamed twice, as if something really big had smacked into me or shot through me. It felt like birthing, and orgasm, and dying, all at once. I didn't have a choice about it. I felt like I was cycling in and out of consciousness in microsecond intervals. At one point, when I called to Panyin, the sitter gently reminded me 'Panyin is having her own trip.' This kind of brought me back to the current time-space, but I was still confused, and I was worried that I wouldn't pop back up in the same 'place' (i.e. Samanthe, my ego self, my familiar personality) the next time I went 'unconscious'  but maybe there was a chance I would pop up somewhere different on the karmic wheel, like a beggar in the streets of Bangladesh. I hallucinated that my sitter growled at me, 'come on, you can't let us down now, we've put so much work into you,' which made me slightly paranoid. I imagined that another mentor friend was in the room in spirit and that I needed to 'come back' or I would really be letting her and everyone down (as in everyone else who values this work). I saw a brief image of papers, like scientific papers with citations at the bottom, and it didn't make sense to me, they didn't seem important to me, because I had no sense of the past. I vaguely reminded myself of all of the books that have been written and the other physical manifestations of human existence that I was imagining as my anchor or trail of crumbs back to 'my' 'life.' I also had a vivid impression that reality was all inside the room where we were, and that I would be there forever. I realized we were all women in the room and I felt a twinge of embarassment that I had called out to my boyfriend, as if it were improper to not stay in the present (the present trip being, 'you are here with two woman sitters, no need to call out for anyone not already here'). It was like a lesson about being where you're at, relating to the people in your presence, and not being somewhere where you're not, relating to people in your head, if that makes sense. I think the sitter did say to me at one point when I called out for Gaichi,  'Gaichi's not here, he's in your head,' and that was at first bewildering but made perfectly good sense. I don't remember if the messages in the following three paragraphs came through before or after the difficult part of the session. Even though they were not original in content -- in fact they were pretty archetypal -- I experienced them *viscerally* which had a bigger impact than mere 'book learning':I realized my mother and my father are not my only teachers and parents -- I am the child of everyone I have ever met and not met, and my parents are also brother and sister and children to me. It was a clear message that my parents aren't really my 'parents' -- as if I unlearned the conditioning about what parents 'are.' Basically, they were my portal into this world and I also happened to have learned many things from them. They are not gods. I was seeing from a broader (less unconsciously child-like) perspective what they really are in my life.I reviewed the crucial nature of storytelling -- the stories and myths we tell and listen to create us and create the world, and the art that artists make creates the world. Artists are sacred and to be revered because they show us things that *can* be and that have been and should be remembered. If we forget stories we forget who we are -- *remembering* is very important. If we don't do that we lose ourselves. I thought of great writers (interestingly the ones who came to mind were all women) and imagined how crucial their work is to the process of remembering.  Because the stories we tell wind throughout 'time' and create it, the result is that time really is non-linear. Our ancestors are not just in the past -- they are here and now. I also realized the importance of telling our own stories to other people -- of speaking out instead of just keeping it all inside, of finding one's voice and having the courage to use it. It is really essential to be nice to oneself, to pamper oneself, to seek out quality and beauty for oneself in order to create a beautiful and true existence. This message came in at the end and throughout the next day when I started to interact with the world again.Things that kept me going through the experience:  there's a beginning, a middle and an end (said just like that, by the sitter)  Prayer: 'How may I best be of service, how may I serve thee God.' (this may sound awfully conventional and I don't even really pray to 'God' but in the midst of my intoxication it provided some comfort)  Sometimes you're in a difficult place, but it's just because it's your turn to be there.  When Panyin and I were back at our room for the night (at about T+8:00, following a simple meal of soup prepared by the sitters), I tried to go to sleep. But my mind was flooded with thoughts, mainly variations on the theme of karma. I wondered if perhaps I had fulfilled the duties of this incarnation and might pass away in the night and be reborn somewhere else in my sleep. This was disconcerting. I thought about my life's work and my primary relationship and the family of humankind and my mind was exhausted with the bigness of it all. I didn't become frustrated, I was patient, and this was because the context for all this was a good one.We are all one -- the many faces of God -- each person carries in them a seed of all archetypes. Just because we are born to a family doesn't make that our only family -- sometimes our birth family is not even our family at all. So, it's important to not be hung up on the family trip, however, it's very important to honor parents and grandparents on the principle that they have come before us and are also participating in this trip/dance. It is also important to honor and speak to other archetypes in parents and grandparents (i.e. brother, sister, lover).(end of notes)I had so many thoughts that night. I thought a lot about money and other types of currency (words are a major currency -- the meanings we attribute to currency of any kind allow us to co-create our reality) that we exchange as we dance the human interaction dance/flow and create our world. I thought about 'trips' -- each persons has their trips. And we can choose to perceive them or not, and participate in them or not; ultimately it's up to us (I was getting lots of lessons on 'free will.') I saw the fragility of life, how unpredictable our lessons can be, no matter how carefully we plan, and that is awesome. Because of the fragility of life, it's foolish to overdevelop one relationship at the expense of others because ultimately you rob yourself -- if that person dies, you have missed out on all the other interactions (this thought probably related to my perceiving my parents as codependent). If you also are developing relationships with other people and a principle in your life dies, then you carry them with you forever and you also have other people there to help you grieve. All of the 'stuff' that was coming through and the observations above were understood on a deep deep visceral level, even if at first glance they appear trite or self-evident. The next day, I was not very grounded, and I couldn't drive. I could barely talk. I reminded myself to be really nice to myself. It was then that I decided that I would not be participating in a group session with ayahuasca the next day. I had a lot of things to process and had no use for another day of 'churning the waters.' Too much to integrate already. At 2 pm or so (T+25:00) I finally took 4 mg of Valium because I craved some respite. I was *so* grateful for it. I slept for 2 and a half hours and when I came out of it I was *still* totally spacey. Panyin and I went to see a movie. I estimate it took my about 30 hours to get back to baseline.------------------------------------The next day, I sat with eyeshades during everyone else's experience. I felt my chronic shoulder pain acutely. After about an hour, I was telling myself over and over again, 'be gentle with yourself.' I felt the pain shift and diminish. It came back, and I just reminded myself, 'be gentle with yourself.'After many hours, I fell asleep. When I woke up on Sunday, I wrote the things above. I also took notes while another woman shared her notes, because her words spoke to my experience and stimulated my thoughts: Embodiment -- learning self-affirmations through the body (movement & breath) -- assures that those lessons will stay with us and be with us when we need them...  Men are subtly taught that their bodies are less valuable than women's, that theirs are expendable (mainly through wars). This erodes their humanity and their nurturing. They really need nurturing, and so do women. Healing ourselves is our gift to the world. Work with the plant to learn things, different aspects of the Self. We need Sanga--community--to share, to become ourselves, because living among people not of our community can become confusing. Be gentle, develop beauty. Do not delay pleasure that can be felt now. Connecting with the same gender is important, to become human, to learn to avoid playing roles which don't fit us. We are what we take in--it is divine. We are the Creator, being created, and creating. Respect each other's truths--it is all part of God/Universe.------------------------------------Notes, 2001: It's really enjoyable to re-read what I wrote, and flesh it out, with the perspective of two years. It feels good to see I've applied some of what I learned, and that what I haven't yet applied, I still see myself doing in the future. This trip feels like a part of the fabric of my life. It was incredibly difficult to endure. And it felt like I endured it -- I am learning that I want my life to be about experiencing, not about enduring. I can see now how I was imagining that the 'right' way to trip was to do a high-dose LSD session, and I dutifully followed the imperative even though I was terrified. I'm a little better about not being so hard on myself these days. I'm not sure if I would go to that fear space again -- I think probably not. But I don't feel like repeating LSD or mushrooms like that again -- I prefer ayahuasca. The LSD felt too mental for my taste, and mushrooms feel just plain weird. But I am so grateful I went where I did with this trip!Exp Year: 1999ExpID: 9764Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 4, 2001Views: 72,879    Mushrooms (39), LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Guides / Sitters (39), Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:120 lbThe experience was proabably one of the terrible trips of my life. I took acid thinking it would just be like weed, where I would be tripping and laughing, little did I realize that acid can take you into a different world where your not in touch with reality, nor your body and soul. Shortly after I consumed acid I was seeing the world in a new view, like another dimension. Though objects did look cool, I was in miserable hell, I felt like a lost, extrememly lonely girl who has fallen into a deep dark hole and no one was there to help me.  Also while I was on acid I had a reality check, I hated all my friends and I felt like everyone was out there to get me, all my thoughts were negative and I wanted to  inflict my pain upon everyone. I was in complete paranoia and my false worries turned into reality, I was in ultimate hell and i could'nt get out. Though I did regret the experience I wish I would have done it around someone I really loved and trusted, becuase even though I had a bad trip I can see how drugs sometimes can be a beautiful thing if done right and with the right person.

It was a half tab of some home made and I went to a rave and danced all night. I spent the entire trip in a decent atmosphere surrounded by people who were into having a good time. No negative vibes in the air, and I was still young (18) and optimistic. It was the beginning of a long slide into the dark world of drug abuse.   About three months later a friend and I decided to take the mother of all trips. We started around 11:00 PM on the harbour front in my hometown (a nice Canadian tourist town) and took what probably amounted to a quad of blotter each. We then smoked some massive reefer (a gram joint) right down to the cherry. The pot hit quick and we walked along the harbour wall. The LSD ascent was rapid, and before too long we were giggling and staring at each other in amazement as to how fucked up we were. That afternoon we toured all the local attractions: Undersea World, Wax Museum, History Museum, and the park. The experience was truly amazing, nothing psychological, all of it pure visual/auditory hallucination and body rockin'. The comedown was clean. This was to be the last good trip I had.   A year later I was far deeper into the drugs, taking more pot than I needed to, and drinking heavily. I had left home and was living amongst the drugged. It was a dark place, and not at all condusive to happy tripping. I was involved in an interesting experiment.   A friend of mine was thinking of buying some sheets of LSD from a supplier, and he wanted me to test it out for him. In the middle of the night I met the supplier at a local doughnut shop, and he gave me two tabs of what he claimed were double hits. One had purple dinosaurs on it, the other blank. I popped the dino and started walking to meet my friend. The walk was about six kilometers to a house I had only visited in the day, and so sure enough I got lost. I had only been walking for an hour, and not feeling the effects decided to pop the other tab. I wandered around the neighbourhood where I figured my friend was hanging, waiting for me to show. I burned through a pack of Marlborough red in the space of an hour. I stopped to drink from people's garden hoses, I was so parched. Finally, somewhere in the darkness I heard someone whisper ' 'ere ' and I could see a glowing cherry shining in the shadows. I hobbled over, and there was my man, holding a joint out for me to take. Which I did, and toked heavy before collapsing backward onto the grass. I was in the backyard of the place I was supposed to be at. The grass felt amazingly soft and I could have lay there forever if not for the others around. My friend was asking how it was, and all I could say was 'Fuckin'-A, fuckin'-A'. After two hours of walking, I felt the effects of the high here. I was enraptured by the play of colors across a spiderweb in the window. I was pretty high, and at this point it was all visual hallucination. We went inside, I grabbed some food out of the fridge. This house was not mine, and the food certainly wasn't, but I was in that godhead mode where, if I want it, I can find the shortest path to it, and take it. Megalomanic selfishness! Anyhow, I grabbed the food without complaint, chomping down an apple and a carrot. We retired to the basement and played some computer games. Or I should say 'tried to play'. I couldn't get past the configuration screen. It was Doom, a game where you run around trying to shoot your buddies. My friend loaded it up for me proper, but I couldn't get into it. I couldn't kill my friends. I just ran around the game board asking 'is this all we do? Kill each other? what's the point?' I retired to a corner of the room and worked out a plan to take over the world. There were three of us in that computer room, two guys on the game and me on the LSD. I stared at them playing the game, thinking 'fuck man, these guys are wasting their time with this shit, let's get global and take things over!' I tried to relate these glorious plans to them, but they kept saying 'oh you're high, talk to us when you come down'. Sure enough I didn't come down at all and the sun began to rise. Everyone went off to bed, and no one mentioned it to me that it would be okay for me to pass out there, so I felt like a complete stranger in this house. I hurriedly grabbed my coat and hit the door. It was a cold morning, October 23rd, 1993. I was wasted. I tried to leave the neighbourhood but I couldn't! I would run halfway down one street and then realize I had to go back to the house. I would head back to the house and realize I had to go home. It was a weird causality loop that eventually had me wandering the neighbood crossroad in a circle. I felt I couldn't go to any of the houses for assistance, obviously, because I was fucked out of my mind and they would call the cops! After circling for a while, I felt tired and decided to lay down on the ground, right on the cold concrete on the road, and try to sleep. That's when death came for me. I felt my heart slow, then stop. It seemed like people surrounded me, taking my pulse and asking if I was all right. I couldn't respond. I was lying there, completely paralyzed. Then I heard someone say 'this one's gone, let's get out of here' and terror seized me then. I leapt up and began to run that same loop again, of heading down a street and back to the house. My thoughts went back to the moment I dropped the acid. Time was distorted. One moment I was in the doughnut shop talking to the supplier, then I was back at the house talking to the people there, and then I was in the street. I heard my friend say 'Join the human race, man' and one of the girls that was at that house say 'we are your friends, don't you care about us? what about your family? what will they think about this?'. Again I was seized with terror as I realized my father would just shit when he found out about this. Up to now my father had a fairly good idea that his son was a worthless drug addict, but he'd never had any concrete evidence. If I got caught in this situation, he would have me over a barrel. I looked up to the sky, and there in the pink morning sky, a white-bearded old face looked down at me and my addled mind told me it was God, and in order to redeem myself, I had to come down, become a priest, and spread the word of God among the masses. I agreed, my mind shouted, anything to end this confusion! Then I went into another loop, this time fully within my mind, where I was searching for a word. If only I could find this one word, I could break these loops and go home, everything would be all right. I paced in a tight circle, wracking my brain for the word, what was it, what could it be? Then it came to me: Life! The word was life! It wasn't just to realize it, I had to shout it out at the top of my lungs for all the world! So there I was, 5 AM in a deserted intersection, this skinny, dirty, drug-crazed kid, screaming Life! Life! Life! at the top of his scratchy lungs. The cops came.   This is when it started to get really bad. So there I am, screaming, and I hear the noise of an engine behind me. I slowly turn, and a car is bearing down on me! I feel an impact - and then there are two cops standing in front of me. 'What's happening, son? What's going on?' they ask. I mumble something about overdosing on LSD. They decide I need to take a ride with them, which was the absolutely last thing on my mind. I resist, and they cuff me and toss me into the back of the cruiser. It was the puke-mobile, for those of you with experience, the one with the hard plastic rear seat. I didn't know this, and being thrown into a car with a hard plastic seat scared the hell out of me. I started screaming again, Life! Life! but the cops didn't care. We moved.   I was given a full head job by these cops. One of them kept asking me questions and answering them for me. 'What's your name? Beezlebub? Satan? The devil?' I got scared. I thought I saw my house, and when I said so, they told me I wasn't going there, no one wanted me there. So they took me to the hospital. I was dragged out of the car, and through the back entrance of the hospital. They took me to a small room and restrained me, face down, to a bed. I got shot in the ass with something, probably a dopamine, to this day I have no idea. Then they left me there. The door was a big steel job with a locking bolt ratchet across the middle of it, and I felt like I was in an asylum. I lay there for a while, then I became convinced that the Cenobites from Clive Barker's Hellraiser were coming for me. They would come right through the wall and flay my worthless ass, then drag me off to hell for some unending torment. Like this present condition wasn't enough. The cuffs were burning my wrists from my struggling. I still have scars on my wrists from this. Well the Cenobites didn't come (maybe my screaming Life! Life! kept them at bay) but something worse did. This haggardly nurse with a face of dripping wax told me she was coming back in a while to do some bloodwork. Now you probably know bloodwork is a common term for taking and analysing blood. I didn't. I was scared shitless. They came and took the blood without flaying me, and I began to feel somewhat sane again. I slowly came down, and they gave me some food, and then my father was there to take me home. This really freaked me out because I don't recall giving the cops any information about myself, and I wasn't carrying my wallet at the time either. He took me home, absolutely disgusted with me (I don't blame him) and I passed out in my old room. I woke up some ten hours later and still didn't feel normal, but I had to go to work. It felt like my reality had been turned inside out. Yet I knew I was alive, and that relief overcame my feelings of dread. I went to work, related some of the story to my boss, and went back home. It would be three months before my confidence returned.    With an experience like that, you'd think I would have had the sense to quit all together? No. I carefully looked back at that experience with an objective eye and saw it for what it was. I needed to take the LSD at that time to show myself the depths to which I had sunk. The whole god/Cenobite thing was a pure product of my subconsious, all of the images known to me. I was afraid, deep down, of facing my fears of death, and of facing up to real living, away from drugs. It wasn't until two years later that I would fully be free from drugs, but this was a major step in that direction. It would not be the last trip however.   It was the night of my twentieth birthday when I tripped on LSD for the last time. I was at a party, and it just happened. An old friend of mine was going to drop, and for some reason, I felt I had to drop with him. So we popped a double tab of blotter each, and went off with a third friend to my apartment. The plan was to chill there and just trip in peace, or maybe take a walkabout. We got to the pad but the other guys wanted weed. So the third friend called his dealer, and we agreed to walk out to meet him. Stepping back outside (I was living downtown at this point, in a seedy shit bachelor apartment in the low-rent drug red-zone) the LSD kicked me like a mule. I was soaring. We headed down the street to the dealer's place, and on the other side of the street I saw a rag-tag aboriginal family trudging in the opposite direction. I swear to god they were calling out my name 'Christopher! Where are you? Christopher!' and it freaked me out, because my mother is aboriginal, and I felt that this was the family I had abandoned. I dwelled on this for only a bit, because at the next major intersection, the third friend started screaming into traffic 'Whooooo! Whoooo! Isn't this great? Walking around downtown just completely fucked? Whooooo!' He was hanging off a lamp-post into traffic, and at that point, put into that perspective, I couldn't think of anything worse than walking around downtown fucked up. What if the cops stopped us? As the signal changed to let us cross, I waited until the two friends were walking before rapidly retreating back to my apartment. I rushed in, took the elevator up to the third, and locked my door. I ripped off my boots, and cowered in bed, fully clothed. Sure enough, the guys figured out I was gone and came back. The apartment buzzer blasted through my waking dream and I cowered deeper into the covers. They screamed up from the street 'Chris! Chris!' This freaked me out more. I simply tried to disappear. Eventually they left, and then tried to call from a phone. I tore the phone out of the wall. Finally, I would have peace. It was 2 AM.   There was a late night pizza place, Romeo's, below the north window of that apartment, and I could hear tons of bass coming from there. I went to the window, and hung out over the street. It seemed like the street was full of taxis, stretching as far as I could see to the west. In the parking lot, all manner of cars were parked, and people were partying. It was too much for me, so I headed back to the bed. I tossed and turned, trying to sleep. I cast furtive glances at my boots, there by the door, thinking 'shouln't I be somewhere? I should be walking somewhere'. A serious hole opened in my fabric of reality - literaly! The black and shimmering hole opened above my bed, and I could put my hand into it! I looked at the clock. It was 1:36 AM! How could this be? I had gone backward in time? I was tripping now for sure. There was no real apprehension or terror here, not like that trip two years before, just a sense of 'wow, I am so totally fucked up, and it's my birthday' Some time later I was able to think in sequence enough to go into the bathroom and take a shower. It felt like my body was just covered in a grease I couldn't remove. I stared at my nakedness in the mirror and thought 'man, I am so unhealthy and ugly' It was largely true. Four years of drug abuse had not been kind to my frame. My bones were clearly visable below my sallow skin, and my face was covered with pocks and pimples. I cried. What had become of me? Again and again the realization came that I was twenty years old and I hadn't done a damn thing worthwhile. I flicked on the television, and all the early morning children's shows were on. Yet in each and every one the message was the same: Make friends of your enemies. I thought, it's so true, how many people do I hate that don't even deserve it, and I am the one I hate. It's all in me, I am the only one who affects my reality, and this is what I have done. What a failure. I was coming down, but not fast enough. I had to meet my family in the morning for my 'birthday party'. I was still high when my father came to get me. We drove towards the family house and a kid on a skateboard crossed the road in front of us, tried a trick, and bailed. My father said 'He thinks he's so cool!' and I felt he was talking about me, about my lifestyle. It was terrible. I was so pitiable. We got to the house, and there my three totally clean family members gathered around me and stared at me with open disgust. They knew I was a drugged-out loser who didn't deserve a show of affection, even on his birthday. I took the cards, cried again, and went home.   Bad trip? Hardly. Perhaps this was the best trip of all. I learned all I needed to learn. From that day on, five years ago, I have devoted all my time to improving myself. I am clean, no drug use, no alcohol use. I eat healthy, and exercise regularly. I am a beautifully solid 180 lbs, with clear skin and a positive glow. I married last year to a beautiful woman who has taught me more about myself than any drug ever could.    Are drugs good or bad? Drugs are drugs, and they have their uses. It's like medicine. If you're sick, you take it. I think that most of us are in some way psychically sick, and this is the reason so many of us are drugged...    Thank you for your time, if you took the time to read this, and I hope it has helped you in some way. I know it helped me.Exp Year: 1993ExpID: 3486Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 31, 2001Views: 28,174    LSD (2) : Retrospective / Summary (11), Bad Trips (6), Various (28) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD  2 tabletsoralMDMA(pill / tablet)BODY WEIGHT:180 lbI love tripping. I love the mind games, the visuals, the feeling of being electronic, the ideas, and I especially love how close it can bring two people. I've done LSD probably a hundred times in my life, and I never once had a bad experience until this day in June 2000. It was a few weeks after the second most amazing acid experience of my life, which I should probably document one of these days. R. came across a new guy who sold acid, and we were all incredibly excited to take it this weekend. R. and his girlfriend, A., came over Friday night, and had split a sugar cube. A. was tripping pretty hard, while R. hardly felt anything. Obviously A. got the good part of the cube! We (G. and I) got our hits from R. and decided to save them for the next day. G. loves tripping in the daytime, while I'm more of a night tripper. While I love the trees and patterns in the grass during the day, I can't turn my back on my good friends, The Lights.Saturday, around 4pm, we each took our sugarcubes in G.'s apartment. We watched TV for about a hour in silent anticipation, but didn't feel a thing. We decided to take a walk across the street to the drugstore to purchase some agave cactus snapple (mmm), and we both started to feel slightly silly while crossing the intersection. Nice timing! We got to the store and roamed around, playing with the stuffed animals, etc. We were definitely not tripping nearly as hard as we could have been.. I kept thinking back to high school, when I used to eat acid every day and I'd need to take several hits in order to feel anything more than the 'i just took an unidentified drug' feeling. I was afraid it was going to be like that again.. I decided to wait it out, and so did G.We walked back to his apartment and sat down on the couch once again. It had been 1 hour and 45 minutes, and we still did not feel as though we were full-fledged tripping. This was only G's second time tripping, so I had to try to assure him that it's definitely possible for it to take this long to kick in, though I was definitely having my doubts.We decided to drive over to R. and A's place to see what they were up to. They ate two cubes as we walked in the door, but I felt the need to warn them about their lack of potency. It was hard for A. to believe, because she was beyond fucked up the night before.We went out and came back and sat around the living room. It had been 3 hours for G. and I, and we were still hardly feeling it. R. and A. were not feeling it at all at this point. We smoked a little weed to get our spirits up, and it definitely did the trick. Slowly but surely, I started feeling it more and more. I was beginning to see the electronic outlines of everything.. everything seemed to vibrate very fast, and eminated the color of acid (you know exactly what I mean! that beautiful color that you've only seen while tripping!). It wasn't intense, but it was there.Come to think of it, I think that's what the problem with this whole trip was. I knew I took acid, but I was so obsessed with the fact that it wasn't strong. It just made me miserable. I kept smoking more weed to make up for it.When R. and A. started feeling it, we watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. It was interesting to watch in this condition, as I'd imagined it to be. The fact that I was able to concentrate on a movie really upset me. I wanted to be tripping, full on. So did everyone else. We decided to take some MDMA (highbeams - SUPER fucking speedy).. each of us taking one pill. We hardly even rolled! We took another, and had a minimal roll. Our minds were too cloudy to appreciate it, though candyflips in the past have been amazing.I knew how uncomfortable G. was. I felt it. We kept making eye contact, and I noticed that we were definitely talking to each other without words. We knew exactly what the other wanted, and it was starting to scare us.Sure, that's happened to me before - you're tripping, and you're on the exact same wavelength as the person you're with. You feel attached. You feel like you are the same person. That's how we felt, except our thoughts were horrible. We started to scare ourselves. We couldn't talk about it because nobody else was thinking that way. We looked at each other and both needed to get out of there. We got in the car and G. started to drive away. Not a word was said for a few blocks.'What's happening?' he asked me. I was so glad he asked me that, yet totally petrified to face the answer, whatever it was.'I don't know. I'm scared.' I told him. He told me he was scared to.'What do we do in this situation?' he asked. I told him I didn't know, and that we shouldn't think about it. Obviously, that wasn't going to help.We went into his apartment and set the lighting scheme to a comfortable one. We paced around the apartment, trying to articulate what exactly was going on. Something horrible was happening, or going to happen. We both knew this. I was afraid to start crying because I didn't think I could stop. I have never been so petrified in my entire life. We kept telling each other and ourselves that there was nothing weird going on, and that this was in our heads. The thought of this being 'just in my head' was the scariest thing of all, though. I started to think I was going crazy. I KNEW I was going crazy. I started hearing screaming in my head. I didn't know what was going to happen, but I knew it involved me dying of fear. Is that possible? The whole time this was happening, we kept talking about how we were so petrified about the fact that we could read each other's minds. We knew how much this meant to each other, but at the same time it was just such a BIG concept to grasp. Too amazing to handle. I couldn't comprehend it. I should probably thank the MDMA making me not understand anything that was going on.I tried to stay strong for G., who's second trip was just looking terrible. I kept making excuses for why this has never happened to me before. I had to make sure that we were going to recover. We talked about everything going through our heads, and we knew exactly how the other felt. I couldn't get over how the weakest acid I've ever done gave me such a horrible trip. It was kind of laughable at this point, but we were still so scared. We laid on the floor and held each other until we decided to try to sleep. I've tried to sleep while tripping before. It's not a good idea. We bought sleeping pills earlier in the day, and I decided to take the recommended dosage (2 pills). Tried to sleep for 2 hours, didn't work. I took 3 more sleeping pills (don't try this at home kids- it's a really stupid idea, and i was so fucked up i just wanted to fix myself) and that also didn't work. Eventually, I took 4 valerian root and drank a whole lot of water. That put me to sleep, finally.The next day, I felt incredibly anxious and uneasy. My body ached, but I felt like I played a really intense mind game. I felt like my brain got excersize. But I'm still scared. I've been scared for a really long time. I have a real problem with being afraid of everything, and this made me afraid of LSD, my favorite thing in the world besides my cat. I know that this was really shitty acid and that all of the factors mentioned above contributed to my shitty trip, and I know that I'd jump at the chance to do more in a second, but I still have that fear that I'm afraid won't ever go away....But I feel better now that I've written this.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 2656Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 9, 2001Views: 18,437    LSD (2), MDMA (3) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:155 lbI am presently aged 45, and took LSD at aged 16, during 1972.  I can honestly say that the trip experience was so profound and real, that it has affected me ever since. My parents were on holiday, and I tripped at home, with a work colleague, who was not a good friend, just somebody I knew.  I thought LSD was going to be all flowers and pretty lights, etc., and was looking forward to the experience.   We bought the black microdot tabs from a dealer that he knew, who warned us that the tabs were strong, and to make sure we were somewhere safe.  On the way home on a bus, we dropped the tabs. We got home OK, and decided to go to a local shop.  The time was around 5-6pm. After about half an hour, we started to feel a bit light headed, and giggly.  We returned home, and sat in the front room, and put on some Deep Purple on the hi fi. I can remember moving my hands, and seeing the fingertips trailing behind, and the seeing the walls swaying.  Also, sounds coming out of the hi fi speakers were in colour.  Then, bang.   I lost an hour or two here, my colleague said that I just wandered round and round in circles, in a trance state.  I can vaguely remember seeing my mind on different planes and levels, shooting out into infinity.  I then came round, and noticed the guy with me staring at me in an all-knowing way.  He had tripped before, and I began to get the AWFUL feeling that he had tricked me into taking the tab. As the time went on, I began to get paranoid, and started to realize that this trip was going to last for eternity, and, in fact, my whole life previous to this, was also part of the trip. I saw my parents sitting on the sofa laughing at me, “you've been conned again” on their faces.  I looked at the guy with me, yes, I now realized I knew him, I'd always known him, for eternity, I was in a death trip now, I was sucked into a spiral, everything I looked at, I knew what was coming, DEJA VU on a massive scale. Fear is not a good description of the horror of this experience.   Several times in the trip, I became 'aware' and tried to tell myself, this is stupid, you are you, I repeated my name over and over.  At one stage, I decided to go for a walk.  It was dark, about 11pm. We caught a bus, God knows how.  Walked round a town centre.  It was raining.  The rain hit my face and felt like acid burning holes.  I looked at the guy with me, yes, his name, everything, he was the bastard that always tricks me into taking LSD, and I fall for it every time, for infinity -whoosh  - away again down the deja vu spiral, horrendous sickening fear.   At one stage in town, I looked at an EXIT sign.  Yes,  ex it,  this is it, it is the trip, whoosh - away again.  Managed to get home safely by walking home. We had left the front door unlocked, but got lucky.   I then spent the next 2-3 hours battling with my sanity, as time and time again I suffered the realization, and gut-wrenching fear, that I had done this millions of times before, and could never escape it.   I eventually came down at about 4 am, staring at a gas fire, in a state of shock. The following days I wandered round in a daze, trying to come to terms with what had happened to me.  I only took LSD one more time after that, a half a tab.  To convince myself it was OK.  It wasn’t.  I went to rock concert at a stadium, it was dark, I saw the EXIT signs, I was back on the same trip, panicked, left early, and went home, lay in bed in a state of fear. The following year, I smoked some weed, became paranoid, and suddenly flash backed, I was still on the trip.  I ran panicking, it’s all I can do for a few seconds, then the feeling goes.  I tried sniffing solvent, bang, whilst high, I got the same feeling, still on the trip, panicked and ran again.  People look at me strange, I’m not surprised.    The years went on.  I married and had children, got a good job.    Whilst at work, I had to go into a dark hall, with an illuminated exit sign, bang, - you’ve guessed it, I flash backed again, deja vu, the people with me are all part of the conspiracy. And it goes on.   I’ve had about 7 or 8 flashbacks, some being as far as 8 years apart.  The last one was last week.  I was in a panicky situation involving my job, involving danger. I was dealing with something, when I had the realisation, deja vu feeling again, OH NO, is what I say.  Christ, it’s a nightmare.  So, during my life, Ive tried TM, Buddhism, Martial arts, various other spiritual paths,  I’m lost, I’m searching for sanity,  I honestly don’t know, 29 years later, what is reality.   When I die, I hope it’s blackness and peace, and not part of a neverending trip, and I’ve got to suffer the experience again.My advice to anybody reading this who hasn’t tripped yet,  DON’T.Exp Year: 1972ExpID: 8336Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 24, 2001Views: 80,271    LSD (2) : HPPD / Lasting Visuals (40), Post Trip Problems (8), Bad Trips (6), First Times (2), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:175 lbI tried LSD for the first time at age 14.  Peer pressure was the reason for doing so.  I was with friends at a party and took the hit.  After about an hour I was feeling a bit anxious and jittery and I noticed my visual perception was heightened as well as my hearing.  It seemed like I could here someone sneeze from a block away.  It was interesting to look at things and laugh at everything.After about two and a half hours I started feeling really wierd and warm.  I was soaked in sweat and started taking my shirt off and pants off in the middle of winter,(i am in canada so it's cold here), without having any sensation of being cold what so ever.  I thought the sweat was rain and it felt like summertime.Then I started feeling very intensly paranoid.  Everybody was staring at me and watching what I was doing.  I thought my friends were whispering bad things about me.  I even thought people in cars driving by knew I was on acid.  I was panicking very badly and didn't trust anyone I was with.  I felt hopeless and out of control.I felt like I was going crazy and the feeling or highness was never going to end.  It seemed like it was going to last forever.  At the time this feeling was the most horrible experience I had ever felt in my life.  Everything that I looked at seemed magnified and distored.  I looked at my face and eyes in a mirror and panicked because  my eyes seemed to be floating in different directions and I could see every impurity and pore so intensly in my skin, and every little sound seemed so intense.(ie, water dripping from a tap).  I was fearful, hopeless, nervously shaking and almost called an ambulance to come and take me to the hospital.I tried to stay calm but everything I looked at seemed as if it was breathing.  A curtain covering a closed window seemed as if it was blowing in the wind.  Wrinkles on a sheet seemed to swirl around like snakes.  I didn't actually see anything that wasn't there, but thing that were there seemed to be moving around intensely especially from the corner of my eyes.After the trip was over I seemed to be ok. About a month later I was just in the mall to buy a pair of shoes and all of a sudden out of nowhere I started panicking and feeling as if I was on an acid trip.  My perception was enhanced, sounds became louder, I felt nervous, uncomfortable and very paranoid.  I dropped everything at the shoe store that I was going to buy and rushed out in a panic.  It was as if I was running away from something but I couldn't figure out what.I was too scared to share my feelings with anyone because I thought they would think I was crazy so I lived like this for about two years that I can remember all on my own.  Now my life and mindset are more at a relaxed state and I look at my traumatic experience as a lesson learned well.  I personally know for a fact that my 'LONG LASTING flashback' was definately due to my previous LSD use.  It was not worth the trouble that it caused me and my family.I don't remember ever feeling negative about anything before and since my LSD use (1 time) , it has destroyed a part of me that is greatly missed.  I have become negative and depressed and now rely on 100mg of Zoloft per day forever to keep my mind in a controllable and rational state.  If it wasn't for Zoloft I would probalby be dead from suicide.Exp Year: 1990ExpID: 3168Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Dec 17, 2001Views: 11,249    LSD (2) : Large Group (10+) (19), HPPD / Lasting Visuals (40), Post Trip Problems (8), Depression (15), Health Problems (27), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), First Times (2) DOSE:4.0 mgoralPharms - Fentanyl 5 hitsoralLSD 2 tabletsoralMDMABODY WEIGHT:200 lbjust for a little backround, I have done: LSD, Psilocybin, Salvia, Nitrous Oxide, MDMA, DXM, THC, Opium, GHB, Ketamine, 5Meo-DMT, 2C-T-7, ethyl ether, and other drugs...this experience happened about June 1999I managed to aquire some fentanyl transdermal patches (100 ug/hr, the strongest variety). This is a medication for EXTREME pain, and is also known as 'China White' and is well known by its roll in 'Tango & Cash'... Anyway, I'm writing this because when I was experimenting I found it hard to find information on the net about this substance (and found some WRONG info on usenet), and I wanted to help anyone who is thinking about doing it.... Just remember, fentanyl is stronger than heroin, and I would never think of doing heroin, but since the substance was perscription, somthing made it seem OK... trust me, its not!I took the patch, cut it open, squeezed it out, and swollowed a small amount, a little roll on the corner of a buisness card, maybe 1/30 of the content of the patch, and boosted it with similar doses about 1-2 hours apart to get to the desired high. I would become very stoned, and zonked in general... One of my friends, who had tried heroin, said it was exactly the same without the 'Rush', rather a slow progression. I did this on 4 occasions, but on the 5th a horrible thing happened: I was doing the substance alone, this time with 2 pills of MDMA and 5 hits of (very strong) acid. Two usenet reports told me that the alcohol based substance will evaporate, and when it does the active drug evaporates with it, so I only had a small amount left. What I didn't know is that the while the alcohol evaporates, the drug in fact does not evaporate, and I was now left with a substance much more strong than the already extremely powerful goo. I must have passed out quite quickly because the next thing I remember is about 6 paramedics and 2 cops in my tiny room asking me if I knew where I was, I was having trouble maintaining, this was only about 4 hours after taking the acid, and I was still tripping VERY hard during all of this. They loaded me into an ambulance, and kept asking me what I took, and they explained that they had to shoot me up with Narcan to get me awake. I said I had taken Fentanyl, they kept asking how many? They had a hard time understanding that it was a gel, not pills. Upon arriving at the ER I kept drifting in and out of conciousness as my oxygen saturation dropped as low as 75% (as I was told later). I was shot up with Narcan at least 3-4 more times...  This was due in most part to the hospital's inexperience with fentanyl overdoses (I was their first). they gave me Activated Charcoal (which was really, really bad tasting BTW) and apparently instead of absorbing the chemical and not allowing the body to use it, it absorbed it and left it in my system longer, for a slow release of fentanyl. The first night in the hospital was pure hell...  Being shot up with narcan is not pleasent, I felt a cold rush wave over my body from the point where it is injected and follow it through my entire body. The LSD didn't help either, I was having wild hallucinations throughout the entire first night in the hospital, and actually got very parinoid at the nurse who was shooting me up with the stuff, cursing at her when ever she entered the room (I apologized the next day).During the time while I was passed out I breathed in a lot of saliva, and could have drowned if my friends had not discovered me earlier. I was stuck in the hospital for 5 days with a lot of trouble breathing, and was forced to where an oxygen mask 24 hr a day for 4 out of 5 days. The first few days were so bad I would get winded from rolling on my side.I have vowed never to do another 'hard' drug in my life, it's just not worth it. I didnt do drugs for about 6 months after the experience, except occasional pot smoke. I continue to use all manner of psychadelics, but I promised myself to never do anything but psych's, mdma, and pot for the rest of my existence. A lot of people think i'm a complete nut for even thinking about doing drugs again, but this brush with death made me be a lot less haphazard with use, and I now use much less. It's still probably not a good idea, but that's me...Almost dying, being trapped in a hospital room, shot with drugs, having 2 IV's put in, my FIRST bad trip (after more than 100 positive LSD trips), and so on, and so on, was not the time I was looking for..I was drug tested... as I expected the LSD does not show up, but MDMA showed up as Amphetamines, I claimed I was taking decongestants and there were no follow up questions...Exp Year: 1999ExpID: 4163Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Dec 25, 2001Views: 28,002    Pharms - Fentanyl (223), LSD (2), MDMA (3) : Health Problems (27), Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3), General (1), Various (28) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(pill / tablet)I took acid on a friend's recommendation. I first took ecstasy with him, which was fun so I thought that I would trust him with LSD. I took 2 dots which are apparently quite strong. After about an hour, objects began moving and things seemed to take on great symbolic value. Although the room was utterly silent apart from the music, I remember thinking that we were all still communicating on an incredible level and having each other's thoughts. Soon though we went on a walk and BLAM, the trip went bad. This was after about 2 hours. Everyone was scheming against me; my parents were about to arrive and get mad, the house was full of slugs, time had stopped and I would be like this forever; worst of all, I had no control over my chain of consciousness or thoughts.Eventually I got out of the house and I have been having awful flashbacks since. These often come as I am trying to sleep and I have been having nightmares for about 2months now. I feel that the acid has changed my personality also; I cannot get away from the feeling that everyone is plotting against me. Before taking LSD, I think I was friendly and outgoing. Now, though, I have become introverted and neurotic. I find it difficult to meet people (unless I am on ecstasy) and as I have just started at University, this is very bad for my social life.I do not know what I did wrong; I can just suggest that you think hard about the setting before you take acid. I wish I knew suggestions about controlling the flashbacks or nightmares.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 3667Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Dec 25, 2001Views: 6,895    LSD (2) : Post Trip Problems (8), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:12 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:135 lbI started using LSD in 1991.  My friends and I took lots of trips.  After a year, we were doing it like every four days.  It seemed to us the amount of time it took for our resistance to die down.  It was always a joke that too much was never enough.  We would buy whole sheets and go through it in a month or so (three people).  I had many, many good trips.  It seems it is all a state of mind when tripping.  We were very experienced and could control it.  We knew what to do when someone started to loose it; and we would bring them back to earth.Then one day, I decided fuck it this was it.  I was gonna go hardcore.  I dropped 12 hits at once.  We took amino acids and drank orange juice to pump us up.  I hadn't dropped in about 3 months so I, essentially, had no resistance in my system anymore. It was usual, everything was going good.  And then BAM, I could feel it wave after wave getting stronger.  I lost it.  The worst mistake was to get scared.  I was frightened bad.  I was screaming for them to take me to the hospital.  I couldn't take it.  It was extremely intense and I was there but no one was in control.  I never left my body (though I wish I could have).  We got our other friend who was fine to help me.  They took me somewhere else.  I lost consciousness somewhere in there.  At least mentally (though my friends would disagree).  For ten hours I was climbing around, shaking, babbling, screaming, and informing them I was dead or dying.  I finally came to my senses though not down after that.  I think out of pure exhaustion.  I can't describe what it is like to peak for ten hours nor would I try to.It took me another 36 hours to come down enough to pass as a normal functioning human being.  I pretty much just passed out and woke up a little bit better.  It sucks to wake all messed up.  Whenever we were tired of tripping we needed to sleep.  This was the cure.  We would wake up and we’d be all right again.  Well not this time.  My friends made me stick it out, but because I couldn't drive my ass to the hospital nor to the end of the driveway.It took a week before I felt good again.  After that day I took a half a dose (imagine what an idiot).  It got almost as intense as that day.  It lasted like 8 to 10 hours like normal though.  It now has been over 5 years, and I don't think I will ever get better.  I can't even go to a movie theater anymore because when I get up and leave I flip out from sitting in the dark staring at the screen.  I can't quit smoking because I get stressed out and start flipping.  I don't know how long I can take this crap.  It sucks, sucks, sucks.I have taken college psych twice and they say I should seek out a psychatrist and get meds to control it.  I don't have serious flashbacks I just get panicked and start flipping.  Imagine just flipping out after five years for no apparent reason.  It scares the shit out of me.I know someday I will end up in the hospital emergency room screaming for thorazine or valium.  They won't take me serious and I will have to hurt someone.I also tell myself it will be better to die then go through that again because I have been to hell and I am not going back.  The real heaven or hell has to be better than that.I am a father now and how am I going to explain to my son that I screwed myself up beyond repair.Exp Year: 1994ExpID: 4040Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Dec 25, 2001Views: 6,115    LSD (2) : Post Trip Problems (8), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(gel tab)BODY WEIGHT:130 lbWell, I've been wondering about doing acid for quite a while but what really got me to do it is when a kid came to school fried and he was telling me about all this shit he saw and how cool it was. So I did some research and asked lots of questions about acid. I asked him if he could hook me up with 2 tabs and I waited for about 2 weeks before he finally got them. I sort of had an understanding of what it would be like; Seeing colors, everything is all crazy looking so I wouldn't think it would be a big deal. I tried to find a place to do the acid for a while because i wanted to be sure that everything was cool and i wasn't going to get busted. Finally I asked my friend (Allen) if I could spend the night at his house and his parents weren’t home so everything would be perfect. My two other friends (Dave & Dan) came over to his to spend the night too. All of them weren’t really interested in trying acid and didn’t want me to either but I wanted to so they said all right whatever. They were drinking a lot though so they were already drunk when I got to his house. I also brought a big hunk of hydro chronic so we could get really fucked up. Anyways, I hesitated for a while before taking the tabs because the Allen didn’t know if his grandma was coming to pick him up since his parents were in Las Vegas. She called and he said everything is fine and I felt a little safer so I took 1 tab at a time.Nothing really happened for like half an hour so I decided to go smoke the weed with them. At this point I started trippin and I was fucked up. I wasn’t seeing things yet though. They started whispering to each other and I was like, “what the fuck is going on.” They all started fucking with me and told me that my eyes were bleeding and shit. They  turned off all the lights in the house and I was scared as fuck. They all disappeared and I was searching all around the house for them. I felt like I was in a horror movie and they were the killers. I started walking around the house going, “you guys, come on stop fucking with me, this is scary shit.” But I still couldn’t find them. All of the sudden I turn around and the light turns on in the backyard. And I was freaking out. Then something jumps at the glass doors and bangs on them and I was scared as hell. There was banging everywhere and they kept making these scary sounds.  Dave kept saying, “John, go to the light, John go now or you will die, and shit like that and I was freaking out. So I just did as he said and went toward the light by the stairs. Then they all came out wearing scary Halloween costumes and had baseball bats.I ran into the kitchen and grabbed a knife and said, “stay away from me or I’m going to do something crazy and I’m fucking serious, dude. You guys really don’t want to fuck with me right now!” I wanted to stab myself and get it over with because I was so scared, and I was fucking pissed and still a little scared now, but I didn’t know what to do. They tricked me into giving them the knife then they told me that they were going to kill me and all started talking at the same time.My mind was going crazy and I just fell to the floor and passed out for like I think 2 min. When I woke up I felt them dragging me outside and they threw me on the grass, ran inside and locked the door. I could hear them talking inside and laughing at how funny the shit was but I was fucking scared. I was trippin so bad and I kept asking them to let me in because it was freezing cold. I just sat there on the porch waiting.After about 15 minutes something just jumped at me and scared the fuck out of me. I saw that it was someone in a ski mask but I thought it was going to kill me and it had a baseball bat. So I ran away down the street and it was chasing me but I screamed, “I have had enough of this, I want to get out. Fuck this shit.” And I started charging at person in the ski mask and socked it like 10 times but then he took off the mask and I saw it was Allen and I was begging him to stop all of this and to stop fucking with me. He said ok and it was all a joke so I said ok thank you. We started walking towards the house, and then he started running inside but I tried to keep up.  When I got there everyone was gone so I went everywhere and checked and it was all how it started.I opened the door to the garage where we smoked out to see if they were there and went inside. Then all of the sudden I hear the door slamming and I was like holy shit, nooooo!! They locked me in there and I kept begging them to let me out. I was really freaking out and I couldn’t understand reality. This is when the hallucinating begins.After about 20 minutes of being locked in the freezing cold garage talking to myself and begging them to let me out I looked at the wall and saw all of these patterns. They all started to get wavy and swirly. All of the pipes and wires were all dancing around the room and I was lovin it. It was so dope. The walls looked like they were breathing and kept going back and forth. I looked at this huge piece of wood with a bunch of holes in it. I think it is like a tool holder or something. Well, I saw 1 ant at first but all of the sudden they were everywhere and I got all freaked out. I yelled for my so called friends but they were laughing and everything started spinning.  I looked at the door and saw a bunch of glowing paint and it looked pretty dope. I remembered that I brought a shit load of candy in my bag because I heard that it tastes so good when frying. So I put a starburst in my mouth and it was true. I could taste it 10 times more than if I was sober. I just started grubbing out on all my candies and it tasted sooooo good. I loved it.It seemed like there were two different kinds of hallucination-the scary kind where I saw really freaky shit that I didn’t want to see, and the trippy kind that was really dope.  Glowing lights and neon shit look really cool.I asked my friends if they could at least throw me a blanket or jacket or something because I had no shirt on and it was freezing cold-seriously. They told me to go stand far away from the door and opened it. They threw me the jacket and a bag of chips. At that point, I realized that it was all just a trick or that’s what I was thinking along with a million other possibilities. I felt like I lost control of reality and I didn’t know what to believe. I thought that there were 2 sides of my friends; like evil twins. When they were really fucking with me with the baseball bats and shit-and when they told me everything’s cool.I talked to them through the door and they said that they are doing this for my own good, and they asked me if I wanted to try acid again and I said “no, just please let me out of here let me out, I just want to sit on the couch and chill with you guys. Why are you fucking with me so much?” I started to break a few tears because it was too much to handle—and I bet anyone would of done the same if they were in my situation. They thought that I would kill them if they let me out and said that I was too dangerous out there but I disagreed.They kept asking me what I would do if they let me out and I said, “I wont do anything I just want to go inside the house. I’m not going to kill you guys. Why would I do that? I just want to go in the warm house and go to sleep and get out of this tripp. Just leave me alone and stop fucking with my head. I want to see that this is all real and not just my imagination.” I didn’t know if I was dreaming or not but I just wanted to know the truth. Finally, I got them to open the door for me and I was so relieved when I got out. I talked to them for a while and told them about what I saw in the garage and everything and I was coming down now so I was sort of cool now. We went upstairs to Allen’s room and climbed out his window onto the roof. He had this really cool water balloon launcher so we started launching eggs and grapefruits at houses and after that we went teepeeing houses and it was dope. We stayed up all night long and had to wake up at 6:00 in the morning since they all had baseball games, so I called my dad to pick me up and slept until about 3:00p.m.After that crazy experience I don’t think that I will try acid in the near future and if I ever do it again then I suggest doing it with people I can trust—and I think everyone should take that advice.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 3743Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Dec 25, 2001Views: 845    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Guides / Sitters (39), Bad Trips (6), First Times (2) DOSE:3 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:155 lbAlmost a year ago I had the bad trip of all bad trips on New Year's Eve. I'd already had experience with a bad acid trip and had suffered through a series of panic attacks for several months after my first mushroom trip. However, those events were 8+ months removed from the day seven of us arrived at a friend's winter home in the woods. I started out with two hits and wandered around some country roads for about an hour with my friends, all of whom were tripping and two of whom were 'candy-flipping.' When we arrived back at the cabin, my friend (and supplier) E asked if I wanted to take a third hit with him. I agreed against my better judgment, seeing as how he offered it to me for free (*never take that extra, free acid hit!*). Previously I had never done more than two hits, so was somewhat nervous about what might happen, even though I was familiar with all of my friends and fairly comfortable in our lodging for the night. About an hour and a quarter into the trip, I began to have some serious hallucinations. I was laying on my back watching the sky move and pulsate as if it were a giant dome covered with stars... but the dome was being pushed down upon by giant, other-worldly hands that moved the stars precipitously close to me on the ground. I started to lose the ability to concentrate, think, speak, or communicate clearly with my friends. At first it wasn't unpleasant, just the initial confusion that is part of any acid trip. After a while, however, I found myself laying on the floor inside, lost in a trail of thought that almost undid my mind. I saw all of us as organisms doing only what we needed to in order to get different sorts of sustenance into our bodies. I found it hard for me to fight gravity in order to sit upright or even move my mouth to talk. It dawned on me that the only reasons we ever have to move or act are to ingest the food and water we need to survive, and to enact the natural urges we have as members of the animal kingdom - if we were fed intravenously, we'd never have biological reason to move. The intensity of my trip left me unable to move, and eventually I lost the desire to ever move (or live) again. I saw my friends sucking down cigarettes and beers in their daily attempt to meet the addictions they'd fostered over our years in college and it made me sick to my stomach to think these were some of the substances we find as important as food and water, as our bodies become more addicted to them. To compound these disassociative thoughts, my vision became more distorted than ever before. Friends' faces became bulging, bloated, discolored, and spewed forth burping, squelching noises every time they made some attempt at speech with me. Everything took on nightmarish colors that constantly changed and minute noises, such as a TV in the next room, became a deafening cacaphony of screeching. My life became a pure, living hell for about three hours that stretched on interminably in my mind. I began to feel as though my thoughts were terrible revelations that I'd somehow been exposed to in my higher state of consciousness and eventually tried to relay them to my friends. I was aware that all of my attempts at communicating these thoughts were failing, as I was unable to put any sort of thought into rational words. All I could muster was, 'the things I know could kill a man!' One of my friends turned to another and said, 'Is *he* that fucked up, or is it me?' My words here can't fully describe the terror I lived through that night, but I can share with you the fact that the effects of that trip still linger with me. I generally feel that tripping can lead to personal insight and wisdom and can definitely be a positive experience afterwards, even if it’s not always enjoyable during the trip. However, smoking cannabis since then has sometimes triggered flashbacks so strong that I feel as if I'm back in the cabin, hallucinating wildly and terribly paranoid. This sensation has come on so strong that it's kept me up for hours, hearing auditory hallucinations and being so mentally 'disturbed' that I can't do anything except lay there and wait for the feelings to subside. All of this has led me to quit smoking cannabis, a simple pleasure I never thought to be as harmful as smoking cigarettes or even drinking. Be aware that just one intense trip (no more than my fifth or sixth) can affect your life from there on out. Making the decision to ingest the few cheap hits can do a lot more damage than having a few scary hours immediately afterward. I now don't lose any sleep over my experience of that night and am a stronger person because of it, but there's no way I can wipe some of these awful thoughts, memories, and sights out of my mind completely.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 3923Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Dec 26, 2001Views: 12,226    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:  oralLSD(pill / tablet)BODY WEIGHT:150 lbHave you tried LSD:                                           yesHave you had a bad trip on LSD:                               yes Have you experienced flashbacks:                              yes Did you feel that the bad trip and flashback were connected:  noI have taken many doses of LSD, too many to count. And about 50 or so in the past month. I have been taking LSD on and off for the past 5 years, not so much in the first 4 years thought, it’s hard to find around here. I have had 2 bad trips. The first being the second time I had taken LSD and the 2nd bad trip being only a few weeks ago. The first bad trip was horrible, I was a freshman in high school and I took the hit at lunch. I was sorta tricked into taking LSD cause I didn’t know what it was but I wanted to be cool. after lunch I was fine taking notes when all the sudden I wasn’t taking notes anymore and was facing the chalk board. I looked down at what I had just written and saw that the end of my last line was nothing but scribbles. Then I blacked out a few more times and once came to standing up, with everyone around laughing. I sat back down and began to draw to keep me occupied. Then class let out and I blacked out a few more times walking down the hall. The next class I laid my head down the whole time, wishing it was over and hearing people say my name. My second bad trip ocurred a few weeks ago. I was almost down from my trip when sitting at my computer, blink the power went out, I sat in complete darkness. I just sat for a minute and then got up and felt my way to the door. I opened it expecting some light, boom nothing I opened a door and it was just to more darkness, scared the hell out of me. I finally realized I could use my cell phone to navigate the house for a flashlight, which put off a dim green glow. Then I made my way to my garage, didn’t know that my dog was in there, in his cage and he snorted on my leg and scared me half to death. Then I finally realised where a flashlight was, in my truck, parked on the street. I went outside and was scared to death. No lights anywhere, only moonlight, and a strong wind blowing leaves around. I could see no other cars but mine. It was like in the movies when a killer watches his prey from the bushes. I felt like I was being watched. And when I got to my truck I realised that I left the front door open and coulda let someone in the house. I got my mag light and decided it would be pretty good protection, went in, got ready for bed (try brushing your teeth using only a flash light while trippin) any way I got to bed and hid from the shadow monsters and about an hour later got the hell scared out of me one final time as the power came back on and I got blinded by the neon lights in my room. After that expirence I didnt take any cid for about a week.

I had also done alot of acid before. I had fairly pleasurable results using these 2 drugs seperately of one another, but I was unable to find a good description of what the synergies of the two would be. So, being the kind of brave(stupid?) person that I am, I decided to take it into my own hands and find out what it was like.Well I learned pretty quickly that it ain't fun. Tripping is fun by itself. Cocaine is fun by itself. They are even kind of fun together for awhile. But then take the cravings and the darkness of cocaine with the fragile mindset of tripping and something horrible happened to me. My throat became extremely dry and constricted. I could barely breathe. And the more I thought about it the more I fixated on it. Within an hour or two I thought I was dying. I could barely swallow and my breathing was completely shallow. I choked on every other breath and I swallowed fluid just to keep my throat open. My mind was racing and my heart was racing faster. My whole body was numb and I was starting to black out. At a very last resort I came out of my bedroom and let my sister know that I had done something very very stupid and that I may have to go to the hospital. I could barely choke out the word 'Help'. I lay on the ground for a good 2 hours or so barely breathing struggling for life and sanity. I never made it to the hospital, because my sister talked me out of it. She said that they would most likely pump my stomach and put me into a rehab or something. That didnt sound like something I was interested in, even if I was half-mad on acid and struggling for life. Eventually I calmed down and my throat loosened to the point where I could easily breathe. So there you have it. I didnt die, and I never made it to the hospital, but I sure made a jackass out of myself in front of relatives and I ruined my(and their) weekend. It also brought out in the open my use of drugs, something which I had previously kept private and hidden from them. Its kind of hard to hide something like that when you stumble out of your bedroom in the middle of a regular evening trying to breathe and choke out 'Help!'.Please post this to inform anyone else who is looking to combine these 2 drugs as to one possible result of their actions.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 4691Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Dec 31, 2001Views: 47,781    Cocaine (13), LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Health Problems (27), Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3) DOSE:4 hitsoralLSDBODY WEIGHT:155 lb  On Halloween, my roomate's girlfriend decided we should have a tripping party with some of our friends at her apartment. Upon arriving there, I ingested my hits and sat in her living room waiting for the effects to kick in. Some of my fellow trippers, those that rode with me to her house, dropped at the same time while others didn't drop for a few more hours, when they arrived.The first 'problems' occured when my roomate's girlfriend's friends came. The amount of tripping people in one room was seven. What I experianced was an extreme sense of deja voo. I thought that the conversations were repeating themselves and this repetition manifested itself as me being in a circle with everyone repeating themselves over and over. Many people would consider this experience a bad trip; however I didn't. On later trips I noticed a strange effect. The more people tripping in one small area leads to a more intense experience. I feel this is due to the extremely vunerable position tripping puts ones mind in.Now, later in the Halloween night, a division of the group occured. I noticed that there was an ongoing argument between 3 vs. 4 of the group about whether the lights should be on or off. Some of us wanted to sit in the dark the whole time watching trails or tracers on glowsticks while others, including myself, wished to discuss philosophy in the light so we could see our visuals. The strangest thing about the night happened when one of the Dark Tracers, as we called them, lost a glow stick. They immediatly accused us of stealing it. Every five minutes they would send a 'diplomat' to try to negotiate our return of the stolen glowstick, but we did not have it. They got so paranoid of us and our sinister plans to keep their glowstick that none of them notice in the 50 or so times they walked into the bathroom that the glowstick was sitting on the floor by the toilet. How a person can not notice a glowstick in a dark bathroom while tripping I'll never know.I came to the conclusion that these events are what people call a bad trip. I did not think the trip was bad, just that the people in the room didn't all know each other and there were disagreements about how the most enjoyable tripping experiance could be attained. I do not think that bad trips bring on flashbacks but I haven't had one so I don't know. I have taken exactly 89 1/2 hits in my life over a period of 3 years and find that I now have the ability to concentrate and induce flashbacks. Is this a strange occurance or do others notice this also?

I am fairly experienced with acid, having tripped at least 20 times in the past, and I have taken in excess of 5 hits on multiple occasions, and had never had a bad trip. This night, I dosed 5 cubes at around 6pm, and I expected a fairly routine, intense, yet mellow trip. Around 6:30, I started to get intense body waves and slight visuals, and I knew that this was going to be a big one. I got on the computer and started talking to people until I decided that I couldn't pay attention with all the visuals I was getting, so I went upstairs to get myself in order. When I got up there, I was starting to get kind of panicky, because I felt like I was about to go somewhere I had never been before, so I rolled a joint (with much difficulty) with the hopes of mellowing me out a bit. This was a bad idea, because with each hit, I began to lose more and more control until I felt like I was hanging by a thread. I was getting the most intense visuals of my life, but that was nothing compared to the intense mind fuck that was raping my brain. I felt like I was existing in snapshots, where I would be alert for about 5 seconds, and then I would lose the next 5 seconds, only to return, having to make up for the time I had lost. Does that make sense? If you've experienced it, you would know... I kept trying to think positive, but I could barely think at all so it was a lost cause. I knew I had to get out of my house, so I called my friend and told her I was the middle of a serious tweak, and that I needed help. She said that I sounded completely out of it and that I kept blanking out and slurring my words, and it took about a minute in a half for me to say a simple sentence. I barely remember even calling her. I went outside to wait for her, and as I was standing out in the cold, I could feel all these invisible hands touching and grabbing the back of my legs, and the ground looked like it was shaking and swaying like an earthquake. The only thing I could concentrate on were the cigarettes I kept smoking, which took as much focus as I could muster. I kept forgetting why I was outside, but all I knew was that I could not go back inside. I felt like I was going crazy and losing my mind, and the only thing that kept me sane was the small amount of rationality I had in my mind, which kept telling me that it was only the effects of the drug. It didn't matter though... I wanted out... Finally, my friend arrived and helped me into her car. I kept thinking that it was a bad idea that I had called her, and she was going to try to hurt me. I just sunk into my seat and watched the my surroundings as we drove. The town I have lived in all my life looked so unfamiliar and scary, and I felt like everything was closing in on me. She said she was going to pick up her boyfriend and asked if I would be ok in the car alone for a few moments. I said 'ok', and when she got out of the car I looked at my watch. It said 9:20. While she was inside, I was seeing shadows in the street everywhere, and kept seeing police lights that weren't really there. I kept expecting a swat team to come and pull me out of her car, and I knew that If that happened, I would be able to say nothing to protest because I could barely even think, let alone argue with some nonexistent cops. After several minutes of I got the distinct feeling that I was getting really old really fast, and I looked at my watch again, thinking that I had been in my friends car alone for at least an hour. My watch said 9:22. It had been only 2 minutes since she had left. This really freaked me out, and I put my hands over my ears hoping that the mind fuck would go away. As soon as I did this however, I heard a lound piercing scream-like sound in my left ear. This sound would switch to my right ear and back again, and did so until I took my hands off my ears. Finally, my friend returned with her boyfriend, and we left. Their return calmed me down alot, because it was comforting to listen to their normal conversation, because it reassured me that reality still existed. We drove around for quite a while, until I finally was in the state of mind where I was back in control. She dropped me off at home at around midnight, and I went inside. I was still tripping hard and getting intense visuals, but I had a much higher level of control. I finally went to bed at around 5 am, and woke up at around 1pm today feeling pretty much back to normal, with the exception of some very minor lingering trails, and the memory of an unforgettable night... I guess the moral of the story is NEVER underestimate the power of acid. It can sneak up on you no matter how experienced you are, and present you with a fuck of a bad trip your 1st time, or your 50th. You never know. Be careful.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 5189Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 11, 2002Views: 11,804    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Various (28) DOSE:  repeatedsmokedCannabis(plant material) 6 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)    Pharms - Paroxetine(daily)BODY WEIGHT:130 lbWhat I am about to tell you is the most accurate description I can give of a night in December 2000. Most of the information is taken from a paper I prepared 2 days after the experience. I think about this experience every day, and it's been almost 3 months.I went over to my friends house. He was having a party with about 60 people. We were smoking a lot of weed. Then someone brought acid over. I am an experienced user with acid, and it wasn't too big of a deal that I decided to take six, although the most I had ever had was five, which was a bad experience due to being on a camping trip. But I was with my friends, and there was always weed if I started to get tense. But what I've learned from this experience and many others, is that weed intensifies the trip significantly.First, everything started to get louder about 20 minutes after I had taken them. I was experiencing a mild tripping feeling, with slight visuals and feelings of the adrenaline flowing. We started smoking out of a gasmask. I had a lot, like about 10 bowls. I was in my friend's bedroom, where there were only about 5 people. I started to quickly loose reality 1 hour after I had taken them. That's when things got crazy. All in a sudden, SMASH! I fell through the bed I was laying on, fell through the floor, and down to the next level in the apartment, in which the room looked exactly the same. (I only imagined this had happened). I was laying there, my friends still there. I looked at my chest. Guts were hanging out. I could feel severe pain. I didn't say a word. Things are slightly foggy from there, but I do remember knowing I was dead. I was thinking, what did I do to deserve to die? I couldn't move. People who I knew from school who were not at the party were looking at me, knowing I was dead, and saying things like, he was a weirdo, I never did like him, he deserved it. I was in total terror. So this is what death is like. The ambulance and police came (in my head). I saw the flashers. The cops came in and looked at my dead body. 'Yep thats what acid will do to you' they said smiling. I didn't understand why the music was still playing. I never looked at the imaginary cops directly. My friends were talking about me, about old times. They seemed unusually happy that I was dead. This thought angered me. I kept thinking, what's my coworker, my mom and everyone else going to think when they find out I died when I was tripping. I was wondering when I was going to be dead completely, like going black or going to heaven, hell, or wherever. I was seeing myself almost in the third person, in a pile of blood. I finally got the strength to get up. I thought everyone would be suprised that I was there. My friend was like, 'Are you ok?' I said what the fuck is going on!!!? He calmly said, 'It's a party dude'.  I repeatedly asked him what happened. He said I was just laying there that whole half hour I was on his bed. I looked at where I was lying. There was no blood. I was now experiencing the equivalent to a basic 3 hit trip. I got reality back sooner that I thought I would. The next day, no one will ever know how happy I was to be alive. To this day I am so thankful to be alive, even though I consider my life shitty. I wonder if some parts of the trip were due to Paxil, which I have been taking for months. The times I've tripped while taking Paxil seem to be more intense for a lesser period of time. My point of this story besides sharing my extremely odd and scary experience is, you can be with your best friends and still have a bad trip.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 5348Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 14, 2002Views: 17,206    LSD (2) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Large Group (10+) (19) DOSE:3 hitsoralLSD(liquid)BODY WEIGHT:170 lbIn the past year I have experimented a number of times with acid, probably around ten times. I have taken anywhere from one to six liquid hits, and I have usually enjoyed myself quite thoroughly. My previous strongest trip before the one I am about to describe involved heavy visuals, mild euphoria, and a ceaseless attempt to describe my crazy thoughts to my friend- what I would consider a pretty solid trip, although I remained curious about higher dosages. Last weekend my friend John came down to pick me up. Since John was the same guy I had my previous best trip with, I suggested that we take some acid before we left. He got 2 hits, and I took three, at about 7:30 PM. I told him that this time we would try to keep our tripping under wraps and try to party without acting too crazy. The weekend before I had bought three hits from the same guy and I hardly tripped at all, so I thought this task would be no problem. Also I believe myself to be a pretty level headed guy, and I feel like I am strongly in tune with my self at least on a mental level. So we hurried out to the car and drove to his place. Of course driving is not the best idea, but his place was only fifteen minutes away and we were already on his street and smoking a joint I had rolled before we started to become impaired in any way. We stopped in to a convenience store so I could get some gum (for the jaw grind) and some gatorade for John. I was nervous being in the store and I was happy to leave. We drove down the street to his place and went inside. This is the point where things become shaky. I realized at this point that the acid was coming on extremely fast. I remember pointing at John's roommate and asking 'is this dude going to watch us to make sure we're ok?' Soon enough he got kind of freaked out and left because he didn't ever trip and we were probably becoming kind of scary. The visuals were very intense by 9:00. Heavy fractalization of every surface of the room was occurring, and the patterns were raising up to the extent that they seemed to press together in front of my eyes, like somebody attached an air compressor to the walls and the room swelled up around my face. I have never really been scared about visuals, but this visual experience was a little too close for comfort. The uncontrollably pulsating room had become inescapable to me now, and my closed eye visuals were almost identical to my open ones. I was losing sight of John and grabbed his hand to make sure he was still there. I don't know how I began my downward train of thought, perhaps it was the uneasiness caused by driving on acid, or simply the sheer power of the visuals. I eventually seemed to be losing all contact with the room. I began yelping John's name just to try and prove to myself that he was still there. I lay down on the couch and tried to calm myself down but the effects of the acid were overpowering. I couldn't see the room now, just a constantly swirling gray mass strewn with prism like color effects. Another thing that had begun happening was a rush of energy through my body. Other times that I had tripped I had experienced what I thought was stomach gas, but this time the pain rose up out of my stomach and flowed up over the back of my neck and forward across my brain to my eyes. This current of energy was extremely intense, and seemed to be trying to burst forth from my body with ununrelenting strength. Spikes of solid electricity seemed to be bursting from my fingertips, my arms were numb, with that pins and needles feeling, but multiplied many times, and it felt like a fish hook had been attached to every nerve ending on my skin and the strings were getting tugged. What seemed to be crackling waves of energy were flowing across my head (I can only relate this feeling to the image of those two wires with the electricity traveling upwards between them, with the addition of the sensation of 100 fuses overloading and burning out every second in my head). My eyes felt as if they were pulsating rapidly in and out, and I was certain that they might pop out of my head. These sensory stimuli were unpleasant to say the least. At the same time I began to become less aware of my biological functions. I did not know whether my heart was still beating (when I felt it, it was very rapid) and my mouth and windpipe seemed to become detached from my body and I didn't know if I was still breathing. I constantly held my hand to my mouth to make sure that there was airflow (which there was, but it was very scary to experience this slight dissociation from body for the first time). These uncomfortable physical sensations as well an explosive mental state propelled me into a frenzy of terror. I thought that I had finally made myself insane through this drug which I realized I knew less about than I had earlier liked to think. I was grabbing frantically at the couch by now, trying to keep hold of the real world. I hopefully asked if this was almost over, and John said to my great disappointment that it was only about 10:00. I at one point envisioned a slight opening in my visions, which I interpreted as a rapidly closing portal back into the world of sanity. I used all the will power at my disposal to keep this portal in sight by way of grabbing the couch, yelling out John's name, etc. I felt that if I gave up I would slip forever into this chaotic energy world and be insane. I reached a point where I simply could not fight any longer, and I feared that it was all over. I asked John to call my parents or his or even the police- anybody. I was scared out of my mind. Before this I would have never for a second considered contacting any of these people, something that would not be at all practical except for in an extremely no resort situation. Luckily John did not have long distance and was in no shape to even dial the phone, so I was safe. I finally thought that I had died or lost it, and I thought my parents could be at any minute be crying over my body that I had left far behind in reality. I feel like at that point, if I had more control over what I was doing, I might have actually harmed myself. Somehow, John called his ex girlfriend, who was a veteran tripper, and she came over. When she saw me she ran over and sat next to me. By then I was nearly screaming and crying quite a bit. (I feel almost like a coward now but at the time I simply had no control over what was happening). I kept crying and saying stuff like 'I am sooo fucked up' and 'I am frying my ass off', because by then the physical and sensory sensations were almost unbearable- it literally felt like I had dropped my brain into a crackling frying pan. She was very soothing and rubbed my tingling arms and told me to try and keep my eyes open and it would soon end. After a while I could finally distinguish the room again and was very, very glad, to feel some deceleration of the acid. I got a can of beer but I had to ask John's girlfriend to open it because the senses in my hands were still firing out of control. She left after a while, and I was soon able to calm down and describe to John some of the things that had been going on inside my head. It was almost twelve by then, but the trip was still in full swing with pronounced visuals. Basically for the rest of the time I listened to what John had to say about his views on life which I found quite interesting, and also I felt too burnt out already to do much talking. We sat around and talked for a few more hours, smoked another joint, and after watching half of a movie we went to sleep at about 6:30AM. The next morning I was pretty quiet, because I was still contemplating the experience. I was afraid that I might have damaged myself mentally, or that I might start having flashbacks. So far though I haven’t noticed any adverse effects. I took a shower and my parents came and picked me up that afternoon to take me to dinner. Before I left, though, John made me promise not to do any more acid until I had learned everything I could from the trip. When I got back to school, I talked to a guy I know who has the most drug experience of anyone I know, and he told me he tripped really hard off of only one hit. Although it was by far the single scariest, most uncomfortable and physically painful experience of my life, I am glad that I was able to keep hold of that portal to reality and survive the trip. I would say that it was the first experience of my life that gave me a greater appreciation for life itself. I have actually had a very upbeat week since the event. What surprised me most was how unprepared I was for the intensity of the acid. I had taken more hits than that before, with nowhere near those results. I will most probably not do acid for a long time, and when I do (or advice for others experimenting) I will be very careful about dosage. I had no idea that I could actually have an uncontrollably unpleasant time unless I swallowed a whole vial. Also, the lights were on in the room and there was no music, a situation that I think probably increased my chances of settling on a negative train of thought. And I found that it probably is best to have a sober sitter to reassure you, because with LSD you can never know what to expect.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 5566Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 17, 2002Views: 37,881    LSD (2) : General (1), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:3 hitsoralLSD 4 bowlssmokedCannabisBODY WEIGHT:150 lbThis is story about destruction and redemption. I had taken LSD probably a dozen times and smoked my body weight in marijuana before one fateful night. Until then, me and drugs (and I've tried just about every one) had always gotten along fine.I was with a cousin: we dropped the acid and swung back to his place to smoke. Trip started out fine. Heavy, heavy, heavy, but beautiful. I kept smoking wanting to push it further. Guess I went further that night then I could handle. Came face to face with my limit, for the first time.My cousin was a stranger. I knew him, but didn't know who he was. Looked out the window and saw our world, earth, but in the future. Flying cars, towering neon spires, a night sky that looked like static. Normally I would have loved such intense visuals, but it was too much. I had time traveled, or dimension hopped, and didn't know how to handle it.I pulled my eyes away and tried all the things I normally loved to do on LSD: drawing, listening to music, talking, etc. Nothing worked, my hands wouldn't move right, and my mind couldn't focus on any material task. I eventually begged myself to sleep, and did so... in a whirl of colors, voices, sounds, and strange thoughts.The memory of losing control that night haunted me. I tried LSD over and over to recapture my initial love for the drug, but it, and pot were no longer my teachers, they just fucked me up too bad. I went from being the person everyone asked to trip with, to not being able to touch it. Humbling. :)So I waited years. Grew, got deeper, reflected. Thought about the night and what it meant. Thought about the Grand Scheme. There are many possible explanations of what happened, of why it went sour. I meditated on these.I've begun healing myself. Experiences like that leave scars. Spiritual scars. I'm slowly reprogramming my brain. (For me, it has to be slowly.) I'm letting go of my negative associations, and willing back the good ones through meditation and the use of other substances.There are many factors that come into play when I take drugs. Many of them are well-known: body weight, where you are, who you are with, what you've eaten, how healthy you are, how well rested, etc. But there is another factor when it comes to psychedelics, and that is spiritual readiness. If you push harder and further into The Beyond (call it what you will) then you are ready to go, these things can happen.My advice, as one who has gone to the edge and returned is this: remember psychedelics are sacred. They are a gift. If you are determined to use them, give them the respect and love they deserve. As a wise man once told me, you can't rush the opening of a flower.Be well brothers and sisters. We are all in this thing together.Exp Year: 1990ExpID: 5715Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 21, 2002Views: 13,537    LSD (2) : Retrospective / Summary (11), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(liquid)BODY WEIGHT:107 lbI had done acid once before, but I had only taken one hit the first time and didn't really get much out of it, so I thought I would try  two this time. Around 7pm me and a few other friends each took our one hit and sat around watching tv waiting for the acid to kick in. After about an hour we hadn't felt anything but a slight high, so we decided to take another one. We sat in a friends bedroom and all of a sudden it was like everything around were just the fuuniest things ever...It felt like we had sat there for hours just laughing continuously about nothing. After about what was really 30 mintues I was starting to  really feel it, and I was looking at my friend when she told me the bed was breathing...and I thought she was crazy, but it actually was and then everything around us started to breath and we looked over at this plastic chair and there was a water fall running down it. Then me and my friend H were looking at Bs feet and they started to swell up and we could see the blood going through her feet, so that really scared us and we all decided that we had to all have socks on because it was just to sick to look at anymore. Our friend T who hadn't taken anything decided we needed to go get a movie,  we all piled into her truck and drove to the movie store. On the way there I  had brought my toothbrush and started brushing my teeth and it was the most awsome feeling ever. after we got a movie we had planned on going over to T's brothers house so she could get some alchohol. On the way back to her house we decided to call a friend and see if he wanted to hang out, he had asked us to come over. Since T wanted to drink I decided that I was ok to drive. I still don't really understand how we made it there because one min. we were at her house and the next we were across town. When we got into his house he told us he was going to go get some food and be right back and for us to just stay there. It seemed like he was gone for hours but it had to only be 20-30 mintutes. We sat in the living room and watched tv some more when all of a sudden I jumped up and decided that I didn't like the way his house felt and that it was making me sick looking at everything mutate. I walked into the kitchen hoping it would fade away and I could just go back and watch tv, only it got worse and I kept saying I just wanted it all to stop and that C needed to come back to his house. I walked around in circles feeling fine one secound and the next I was scared and wanted to go home...and then the next secound I thought I was going to die, because I felt like my insides were falling out and they were going to be aten away by  bugs. I thought maybe if I went back into the kitchen and got some water I would be fine, but The water only seemed to make it worse and it all hurt more. My friends just kinda looked at me like they  didn't know what to do. Then I thought I would just go lay down and fall asleep, no way was that going to happen. When I layed down I really felt like everything was being draind from my body and i was getting really scared. We all decided that it was the house and that we just needed to leave. B took me to my car so we could figure out if it was me or just the house. We sat in my car and i was feeling all better and then C came home and came out to the car to see what we were doing and tell us to come back inside. I decided that I was fine to go back inside untill I got inside and he had brought a bunch of people over. Me and B just decided to go upstairs away from them and talk. When I felt like I was going to die again. We went back down stairs and told H and T that we had to go back to T's house. Walking out to the car everyone had felt like the house made them sick. We got in the car and everyone said they felt so much better in the car than the house. I don't remember the drive back to T's house, but somehow we made it. When we walked into the house I soon felt the feeling like i was going to just die AGAIN and  told them to take me to the hospital because I was really dieing. They both just looked at me like I was crazy so  then I  thought if I went into the bathroom and I came  back out and I'd be fine...well the bathroom wasnt the place. The walls in the shower were marble and they keept changing colors and the flowers on the floor were dancing around and the walls were sweating. I was feeling really sick looking at all this so I went back into the room and tried to lay down  but the pain of my insides being ripped out returned. I thought that maybe if I called someone that was sober they could talk to me and tell me  that I wasnt dieing. I called my ex bf  because I thought that only him or my  mom could make everything  go away and I'd be better again, but he wasn't home.  B called her bf since he does this alot he might be able to help us. He was no help. I made several trips to the bathroom thinking I would feel better in there. I tired to explain to H what  I was feeling and I guess I really scared her and she started crying. After awhile we all sat on the bed and me and H were crying and laughing so hard we didn't know if we were happy, sad, scared, tired, etc. About 30 min. of that we were all feeling alot better and decided to go upstairs and get some food. We came back down and ate and talked about what all had happend and why it was happinging. ( we really got no where) around 4am I finally got a hold of my ex bf and talked to him for a few minutes and just talking to him made me feel like I was ok and I could go to sleep. We all fell asleep around 5.So that was the whole trip in short. It started off great and soon turned into the worst thing I have ever felt. I don't know  what made it all go down hill so fast, but I think it was the change of atmosphere and the mood that C put us all in. I don't think I'll stop acid, but I will always remember this and REALLY hope it never happens again.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 5860Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 5, 2002Views: 12,955    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:2.5 hitsoralLSD(gel tab)   repeatedsmokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:145 lbIn highschool, I took LSD many times as a recreational drug until I ultimatly 'pierced the veil' on a few trips, with unpleasent mental results, and no longer take it.  However, I know many people take LSD as a 'fun drug' and not as a tool for introspection, and I'm writing this as a warning of what can happen in the wrong set and setting.I hadn't intended to trip on the day in question, but did so impulsively when someone offered me cheap geltabs.  They were purple, and literally as thick as a guitar pick.  I was unsure of how much to take, but ended up consuming 2-3 at around 11:00AM, figuring classes would be over (at 1:50) before the hardest part of the trip kicked in, and that I'd just skip my classes and wander around the campus/town anyway.  I shortly thereafter remembered that I had a doctors appointment at 4:30, and that my mother was going to pick me up at 5:00 (it was my senior year, but I believe my license was suspended at the time due to traffic tickets).  Based on what I've read, I'd put the dose at around 350 ug, but I have no real way of knowing.An hour or so later, I got the usual body-kick/giggly feeling, intensification of light, patterns, etc, but soon realized things were going to go bad.... I'd be walking through the halls hearing fragments of conversation, and my mind would weave them into conversations about me, my name being called etc, I remember at one point laughing and saying to no one, 'THAT, is paranoia......'.I got out of school, and decided (foolishly) that since pot usually has the effect of making me calm, it would calm me down enough to go to the doctors.  I had $40 on me that I had been intending to spend on pot, I think my plan was to by a 1/2oz bag for 50, but had spent $10 on the acid, I'm not sure.  So I went to the local park with a kid I knew, he was a heavy user of pot, and he agreed to help me around (I knew I was tripping too hard to walk around streets by myself) if I could give him a ride home, which I wasn't sure I could do, but I didn't feel that bad lying to him because I was really freaked out.There were 3 people in a car in the park with some really strong nuggets, they wanted $40/eigth, and it was hard to talk to them, I kept getting paranoid.  But I know I bought the bag and smoked a bowl with them and the person I was with, and really started to freak out..... I wandered around town (small town, just a crossroads, a strip of stores, etc) with him in a daze, at one point I really started to freak out and I said 'I'm having a bad trip' and he just kept saying, 'No, you're not', and that helped calm me down.  But we kept smoking pot until finally I was laying on the roof of a building, staring at the trees above me, and they broke up in 100 other things, nymphs, dryads, etc, in my mind..... but it wasn't the sense of 'being everything' (or alternately, just that 'everything is one') that psychedelic doses of LSD can bring, this was just everything being out of control, broken, and I couldn't make sense of it..... I remember being across the street from my school, and saying something about needing to get down off the roof, and my friend said, 'don't you know where we are?' and I said 'yes, we're on the roof of the pizza place', and he said 'no, look around, man, we left there a long time ago', and I realized he was right, or at least that I believed him, my abilty to interpret visual perceptions was destroyed, I was totally lost in my head, paranoid, I didn't even really know I was on a drug, I just knew I was lost and had to be back at the school at 4:30, I HAD to be there or else BAD THINGS would happen, I HAD to see my mother, it was like being lost at the mall when I was 5 and really scared and I just HAD TO FIND MY MOTHER because she could make it all right, except I knew it wasn't like that at all, and it was all coming in so damn fast I could't process it at all. We got in a van with a bunch of people and the remainder of the pot was passed around and smoked, I remmeber seeing road signs and not knowing what they really meant, but somewhere in the back of my head I knew I had to be back in front of my school at 4:30, and I got obsessed with this, and I kept asking 'what time is it? What time is it?' and finally they got pissed and set all the clocks in the van to like 7PM, and I freaked out, but then we got back to the school, and a few minutes later my mother pulls up, and I manage to say 'can we give (my friend) a ride home?' and she says, 'no, you're going to be late', so I think he was pissed, he walked away, I got in the car and it was all weird and broken, I don't really remember it all that clearly, and she thought I was stoned and was mildly irritated and said, 'were you guys smoking pot?' and it seemed TOTALLY logical to say 'no, I'm on acid', and she got really pissed. At the doctors they ended up just having me sit in a dark room for an hour until I'd calmed down and was somewhat lucid again, and they decided I needed to be removed from classes for 2 months (got to do work at home, yay) because my judgement about taking drugs was bad, AND my parents made me pay for the doctor's appointment, since it was pretty much a waste of money.The moral here is, anyone can have a bad trip anytime, and yeah, at least at my HS there were a fair number of people who took low-to-mid dose LSD in school, but that doesn't make it a good idea.  For some people this drug is a bad idea anytime, and I would very much recommend waiting until you're at least 20 or so to really screw around with it, because hopefully by then you'll be directed and independant enough to integrate the experience into your life.  I've had major problems integrating the psychedelic expirience with my life, I think I was bound to have problems with anxiety/disassociation, I don't blame these personality traits on drugs, but I think LSD made them more visual in their nature.Exp Year: 1999ExpID: 6113Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 13, 2002Views: 36,008    LSD (2) : Post Trip Problems (8), Bad Trips (6), Various (28) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:165 lbIt was right after Christmas in 1995. I had had a fight with my girlfriend and went to a rave with my guitarist friend. When we got to the party, my friend Jeremy took one hit of acid and two hits of H-bomb ecstacy. I dropped two hits of acid and began to mingle around the rave. Everyone there was already tripping and I felt kinda left out. I went to the front entrance and got a beer and sat on an old wooden bench. I sat there for a couple of hours, just watching everybody walk in and out. As I began to trip, I kept thinking, 'pretty soon the cops are gonna come into this place and we are all going to jail. Confusion started to set in and all I could think is that nobody here cares anything about me and my girlfrind is gonna leave me and I'm probably going to jail. After a while I started looking for Jeremy and couldn't find him. I got scared and thought he had left me. I finally found him outside throwing up. He asked me what I wanted to do and I said, 'lets go to my house.' He agreed, and as we began to drive to my house, he said to me, 'You know, it's crazy. I can't even see the road, but I know where I'm going.'When we got back to the house he sat down in my living room floor and began to meditate. I went into the bedroom and looked into the mirror. I watched my face immediately cover over with hair and then crack and melt off of my scull. I got up and looked at the t.v. which had an Orlando Magic game on. Penny Hardaway was shooting free throws and his face had devil horns coming out of it and his eyes were glowing red. I felt this overwhelming sense of evil in the room. I went back into the living room and tried to focus on the christmas tree lights to amuse myself and take my mind off of the evil feelings. As I turned and looked at Jeremy, I noticed that he was sitting in the lotus position, with his hands looking like he was praying but they were pointing down to the floor. I said, 'man, I am not having fun anymore.' He looked at me but his eyes were rolled back in his head and all I could see were the whites of his eyes and he said, 'Just go with it man.' But his voice wasn't his. It was evil, dark, and eerie.I immediately began to shake violently and couldn't control it.I rushed into the bedroom and woke my girlfriend. I told her that I was about to die and that I wanted her to hold me, as she was the only thing in the room that felt alive. As I took her into my arms, something bizzare happenned. I stopped shaking and she started shaking. She got sick to her stomach and I followed her into the bathroom. As we sat in the bathroom I asked her if she would pray and ask God to make this thing leave. She said that she didn't know what to say. I urged her to do it and she did. I had been tripping for 4 hours at this time and when she prayed the trip and the shaking stopped suddenly. We went back to the bedroom after about 30 minutes, and on the way Jeremy looked at me and said,'What's wrong man?' I said,'Nothing now. I am going to bed.'He left about an hour later. That was my last trip. Whether you believe in demons or not, my 'friend' who was into sorcery, tried to have me posessed. I know this now. The demon couldn't have me, so it tried to get my girlfriend who was sober, and is now my wife.I am a preacher now, and looking back, I know that God spared my life that night. Acid opens a door to the spiritual realm that should never be opened. Be smart. Find your spiritual high in Jesus, not drugs.Exp Year: 1995ExpID: 6421Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 26, 2002Views: 11,636    LSD (2) : Entities / Beings (37), Bad Trips (6), Various (28) DOSE:15 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:170 lbMe and some friends had 2 blotters lying around.  We went to a party around 8:00 with tons of people there and were having a good time.  We were alle excited to be frying acid that night so we started around 8:30.  I decided to fry hard, 15 tabs.  This was not a wise idea.  Although I had fried 8-10 before, 15 was a substancial amount more than this.  The first effects started kicking in around 9:20 or so.  First mistake, a movie was being played, a horror movie.  horror movies are not good to be watching while on acid, so in a great deal of fear I asked them to turn it off.  They turned on some porn and this was much more relaxing.  This whole time I was off in my own little world, my friend had left.  This was my second mistake.  One must always be with their ride or their friends on acid.  Being alone while on acid is bad, very bad.  So the acid is hitting me visciously, but I am enjoying it.  The walls are shaking, the patterns are covering my body.  It was quite intense, and I loved it.  Then a guy came to the party.  Someone I'd never met.  Someone told him I was on acid and he decided to 'fuck with me'.  Third mistake, dont be with anyone who will 'fuck with you'.  He continually said to me, 'acid is so bad for you man, that shit is gonna FUCK YOUR BRAINS UP'  and 'Fuck acid man, your fucked!  Enjoy the next 8 hours mother fucker'After about 5 minutes of this I'd decided I'd had quite enough, so I left, and decided to go for a walk.  Fourth Mistake, never go on a walk while on acid alone, especially when frying hard.  I got to the end of the street and was immediately lost.  I had no idea where I was, what i was doing, and the greatest sense of horror I'd ever felt in my life came upon me.  I was out on a major road, on acid, where semi trucks were flying past me at high speed.  I am amazed that I am alive today.  Voices in my head began telling me that to truly understand the universe and its questions, one must DIE.  So I began to ponder the thought of running infront of a truck.  Building up my courage I took a step out on the road.  As a semi truck went by I quickly backed up, but stuck my hand out.  The truck hit my hand on the backside and hurled my hand back out of the road.  This horrified me.  At that point I ran down into a ditch by the road, sat there, in the dark, for the next 6 hours, waiting for the next day.  The next day I found out that my hand was broken.  The memories of that night will haunt me for the rest of my fucking life.  Fuck acid.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 6442Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 27, 2002Views: 8,345    LSD (2) : Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:130 lbIm telling this story of my last experience on acid to warn other users (particularly new users) about the effects of this drug.I was with my future boyfriend and our mutual best friend when i bought 2 tabs of acid off a guy who I had scored off before.  He said they were double dipped and  more potent.  I looked at them and said 'what the hell.'  I had only taken acid twice before and each time had only ingested half a tab, so my decision to take two was a BIG mistake.  I swallowed them and then we went to this park we always went to and parked to listened to tunes in the car.  After about half an hour I was starting to feel the effects and was feeling pretty good. Then my jerk-off friend (knowing Im phobic about spiders) ran his hands up my arm like a spider and told me that a big spider was racing up my arm.  I screamed and started to cry hysterically.  I jumped out of the car screaming and then I noticed a cop across the street giving a guy a ticket and that sent me further into the abyss.  My friends put me back in the car and said we were going to go driving to get away from the cop and calm me down.  At this point I was out of my mind.  I was fluctuating between hysterical crying and laughing.  I could not control my emotions at all.  As we were driving, the oncoming cars started to look very menacing.  The grills became mouths with very sharp teeth and looked like they would eat me.  We pulled over and I found a shard of glass and I refused to put it down believing it was somehow a link to reality.  I was sure I was going insane.  I was still crying and screaming and my boyfriend had to go to a guitar lesson and left me in the car with our friend.  We were in the parking lot and he was talking to me trying to take my mind off my trip.  For about 20 minutes it was working, but then his head turned into a big rat and I, again, lost it.  For about 7 hours I was in that state of hysterics, sure I was dying or going to become insane. When I finally did come down I was emotionally exhausted and my voice had blown out.  I have never been so frightened before in my life and have not touched it since.  I now suffer from a panic disorder.  It causes long lasting panic attacks that mimic my trip in many ways.  I, and my therapist, belive my acid trip caused this.   Well, not caused but uncovered it.  I wish every day that I had not taken that drug, as it was so traumatic that I now have this disorder and also other psychological symptoms that I did not have before my experience. I am not stating that LSD caused my problems in any way, just was the traumatic experience that unleashed a preexisting condition.  However, my problem could have lied dormant and never surfaced at all if I had not indulged in this drug use. I strongly urge that this drug not be taken, but if you choose to:1) take with TRUSTED friends2) ask people who have used it about what to expect3) start with a low dosageExp Year: 1999ExpID: 15477Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 25, 2002Views: 30,122    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Post Trip Problems (8), Health Problems (27), Bad Trips (6) DOSE: T+ 0:001 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:352 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:175 lbI tried LSD for the first time this past Friday/Sat - overall, I would say it was a 'bad trip' - I wasn't prepared for what it could do. And was stupid enough to take three hits total - one, then two more at +35-40 minuts, thinking it wasn't working well. At the same time, I saw some incredibly beautiful things once I stopped trying to control the trip. I was having mild visual hallucinations inside the apartment I was at, until we decided to take a trip to a center area with rocks and grass. One of my friends started talking about slug trails on the rocks, which then made the stones look like giant slugs. This started to freak me out, until my mind took over and I realized why I saw them. But all of the sudden, I looked at my feet and saw things opening up on my skin - which freaked me out incredibly badly. I couldn't get away from that vision until I was safely back in the apartment - where I then began to see small heads coming off of all surfaces, and could even taste them crunching in my mouth when I swallowed water and orange juice. I was constantly scared with an incredibly high heart-rate until I talked with a sober friend, when I said 'maybe I should stop trying to fight the trip and let it happen' (or something along those lines). When he agreed, I did so, and immediately the heads I had been afraid of before became strands of criss-crossing thread filling the room side to side like a smoky haze, piling up little by little.  I was never in great fear of the 'bad' hallucinations - I knew it was in my mind, and once I stopped trying to make them go away, they did. That was about 4 in the morning, and the threads became a constant whenever I wasn't concentrating on something else for the next 10 hours. If I sat with my head to the side, I could see the room slowly filling in front of my eyes, and once the room got to a certain point, the trip began to get much, much more hallucinatory, things dissolving into each other, and so on..  Throughout the night, we had watched the Matrix (actually, I watched about one scene over and over with small changes in scene and dialogue - this was during my freak out), the end of Election and then 'Say Anything.' While sitting in a chair waching the wall and ceiling, something odd started happening with Say Anything. The scenes started playing themselves backward, in my mind (I guess I had paid just enough attention to the first part to absorb it) - audio and visual. Very, very cool. The next eight or so hours (4am to noon - the 'good' part of the trip) were great - I understood why people would take LSD (whereas earlier I was asking 'why in God's name did I do this to myself?'). I was seeing beautiful things (especially a friend's diploma), actually had some interesting conversations (with others and myself).At noon, I got a call from my parents, and they needed me to come home to help with some stuff. They wouldn't be there until 3pm, so (after freaking out once again) I decided to go home, and try to fall asleep in the guest room (which still had my old bed and stuff). Better than telling them I was on acid (no more help on tuition...). I got dressed (when I took my button-up shirt off the coatrack I had hung it on and spun it around my shoulders, two moths/butterflies flew out and landed on the chair - absolutely incredible). Driving (about a five-minute trek) was fairly easy - I wasn't tripping very hard, seeing only minor visuals (yes, I know this was dangerous and stupid). Their was no sense of proportion to my truck, though. It felt like I was driving a vehicle I had never driven before. I popped a 5/500 hydrocodone and a Lodeine, hoping to knock myself out. I curled up under two sets of covers with the TV onto VH1, and proceeded to sleep off and on for the next five hours, until a Nicholas Cage movie drew my attention. I was, by this time, having only minor visuals. Rather than deal with the 'rents in a 'cracked out' state, I feigned illness and stayed in bed all day. I then slept off and on until eight o' clock this morning and am feeling great. Overall, with the two freakouts and a general sense for quite some time of 'when's this going to stop' - I characterize it as a bad trip. But at the same time, I have an overwhelming desire to try a smaller dose with less-violent movies (no Matrix!) and good music (we had no music at all).  I understand the great things LSD can do now and am prepared for them.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 6959Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 28, 2002Views: 12,035    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), First Times (2), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:003 hitssublingualLSD(gel tab)  T+ 0:301.5 hitssublingualLSD(gel tab)BODY WEIGHT:150 lb     Although I had taken a fairly substantial amount of the 'usual' psychodelics (LSD, MDMA, THC, DXM, Psilocybin) before this experience and enjoyed pretty much every second of it, NOTHING could have prepared me for what happened on that dark april night.       My young adult life was filled with drug-induced journeys to the center of my soul -- these journeys would take place with my two step-brothers, both around my age, and they would occur at my house, in my room, bathroom, bed, wherever.  This was the last of those journeys (except for MDMA, but that can't compare) simply because of the sheer intensity of the experience and the terror it induced.       Enough about me; the night began at approximately 6:30PM, after dinner and the parents had begun to get smashed -- another nightly occurrence -- so it was time to drop this 'KILLER' acid that we bought from our cousins, who at the time were my town's major source of acid.  The acid was black --- black like death.  I first went to take a shower, and before I got in the shower I popped 3 hits, and as soon as I got out of the shower I took 1.5 more hits, all of these hits were taken under my tongue, because for some fucked up reason I had heard it hits you harder that way -- I'm still unsure of the actual truth in that.  Doesn't matter to me anymore.     That night had been especially exciting because this was a brand new batch of acid, and also I didn't have school the next morning because of Advanced Placement testing that I was taking for my programming class.  So we were all stoked.  We were also going to record the experience via a microphone onto a tape that I had lying around.       About 1 hour in, I felt the acid bringing me up, slowly, and then all of a sudden everything surrounding me was a big joke.  I must have laughed nonstop for 2 hours, just pointing at something, saying something incomprehensible, and laughing histerically.  My brothers shared this feeling -- we were having a fantastic time.  I even called this chick that I liked up and just started cracking up on the phone... she ended up hanging up on me and I'm not sure I ever talked to her again, or ever would for that matter.  I know, its not cool, but hey it was a fucking riot at the time.  So anyways the trip wore on -- and my mind wore on with it.  At about 4 hours into the trip we were having a blast coloring ourselves with highliter and then going into the bathroom with a blacklight and tripping out looking at the 'neon tattoos.'  The last sane thing I remember is my older brother coming out of the bathroom with what looked like indian tribal warpaint on his face -- except all in highliter.   I didn't notice it until he all of a sudden turned the blacklight on -- and it scared the living shit out of me, and I must have screamed -- which I never should have done.       My dad woke up, amazingly, at the sound of my scream -- and immediately knew something was up... 'what the fuck... what the hell are you kids up to?' ... Hell, I know I'd be a little bit frazzled if I walked into MY son's room and he had highliter all over his body and his pupils were the size of a fucking dinner plate.  Anyways, he was mad but didn't punish us -- he just sent us all to bed, in our respective rooms.  I was all alone, and my trip was just getting started, really.     I tried to sleep.  No good.  Never gonna happen.  I began to ask myself what I was thinking and why I was thinking it to try and rationalize the situation calmly -- for I had never had these 'bad trip' feelings before.  As every minute slipped by, I felt I was growing more and more insane.  I kept trying to sleep, with nothing else to do -- no TV, just a computer.  I got on my computer and played some random game -- and completely sucked at it, and finally got so frazzled and confused that I wanted to do nothing else than go to sleep.  So, I put my Sasha Global Underground CD in and let BT's 'Fibbonacci Sequence' try to take me to sanity, and slumber.  I'm sure you thought that was it -- but no, the good part is yet to come.  Keep in mind that my mind is totally racing at 20000 miles an hour, the WHOLE time that all of this is happening... I was literally falling apart.  As I sat there in bed listening to Sasha, the sounds began to transform into what sounded like whispers, of ghosts... or something else.  I attempted to clarify these whispers, to learn this language that was being spoken to me -- one that can't be understood but any member of the human race.  This whispering language was probably the most horrifying sound I've ever heard.  I came to one conclusion -- it WAS, WITH NO QUESTION, Satan himself.  With that, I had crossed into the realm of insanity.        I ran to the bathroom, stuffed my fingers down my throat hoping to spit the acid out and just stop the whole thing.  Yeah.  Right.  I sat down after my self-induced nothing and tried to pull myself together, and succeeded somewhat.  I decided to take a shower and just go to sleep.  I hopped in the shower and all of a sudden all the fear came back when I saw the water moving BACKWARDS from my skin to the shower head.  I don't know how that makes sense but thats the only way I can explain it.  I jumped out of the shower and ran to my bed, ready to just kill myself.  I moped around the house looking for pills and knives... ANYTHING to end these crazy thoughts that SATAN was putting in to my skull.  I was going apeshit and I was almost out of control -- I'm thankful that I had enough sense to put the knife down.       I think the whole knife ordeal put me back into reality somewhat, but I was by no means on baseline... in fact I don't even think its right to put me on that scale because I simply had lost my mind... I shit you not when I say that I honestly thought that the devil himself was trying to communicate to me.  I finally came down at about 3 or 4 the next day, and I didn't go to sleep until about 9 that night.       I got a 4/5 on my AP test, by the way, and I was fucking STRUNG OUT when I took that test -- kind of odd, isn't it?  Just goes to show you how much of this stuff is in your head.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 15928Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jul 10, 2002Views: 15,643    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:001 hitoralLSD(gel tab)  T+ 0:451 hitoralLSD(gel tab)  T+ 0:59  smokedCannabis BODY WEIGHT:125 lbI considered myself to be quite experienced in drug taking but nothing could prepare me for the dose of reality or should I say unreality that I had experienced that night.I had recently scored some orange geltabs the night before and was quite excited to take them.  None of my friends had any money as usual so I was flying solo that night.  I had taken one geltab around 8:00 pm and went with my friends to go smoke some blunts down by the pool in our town.  I had begun to get impatient around 8:45 since I did not feel anything happening yet. So stupid me drops the other geltab around 9:00. NOTHING. Hours passes and I didnt feel shit. I was pissed. So me and two of my buddies go back to my place around 11:30 to chill and smoke some more. We started playing SuperMario Kart when all of a sudden I started laughing. I knew this wasn't any ordinary laughter. I turned to my friend and said, 'yo man i think im starting to trip' they were all shocked since it had been a couple of hours since I took the two geltabs. I felt it slowly creeping up on me and I didnt want it to sneak away. So I ran to my headphones and started blasting the Jimi Hendrix experience full volume. I sat in my chair watching my friend do some crap on the computer and I was really entertained when it really took a turn for the worst. It was around 12:30 that I was into about the 11th song on the cd and jimi's guitar was blasting pscychedelic sounds into my ears and it just sent me flying into another world at warp speed. I flung the headphones off my ears and  kept hearing these loud sirens going off in my brain. My legs and my arms went completely numb along with my mouth. I started to freak out.  My vision was all distorted like if i was looking through a fun house mirror. Everything looked far away from me.  MY arms, legs and feet looked as if they were 30 ft. away . My head felt detached from my body and I was completely numb. I thought since I couldnt feel my body that if I leaned against anything using my hands, that my elbow would snap at the joint. I was freaking the fuck out! I kept telling myself that this was just a drug and that it would go away soon but nothing would help me. My heart was racing , beating a 1000 miles per second. I thought I was going to have a heart attack. My body started shaking like if I was having a seisure.  I pleaded to my friend( who was drunk) to help me but he didn't do shit expect tell me, 'you got what you asked for' Lousy friend huh?  I was so scared that i was going to die of a heart attack. I wasnt delusional about my heart. It was really beating to the point that i felt like i was going to die. I looked in the mirror and saw my skinny dead like face and it just made me even more scared. I  layed down on my bed and tried to calm myself down by covereing my face with a pillow so that I wouldn't see any more frightening images. Meanwhile my drunk freind passed out on the mini couch i had in my room.  It was around 2:30 when my heart finally calmed down but my body was still spasming and shaking uncontrollably.Around 6:00 I tried to go to sleep but my body was still shaking. I spent the whole time I was laying down just thinking how the hell did this happen to me? It was so strange how it seemed as if I wasn't gonna trip at all to having the worst trip of my life.I have always been affected since that night. Ever time I smoked after that night I would always get real tense in my back and my legs would start shaking like a little flashback . Smoking was never the same for me. =( Ive tripped a couple of times after that but I always prepared myself for the worst.  Here's a lil hint kids, 'keep a couple of potent xanax pills near by just in case if u ever start to freak out to the point that u feel like u are about to die.'

The night on my own and in a really bad trip was the worst of my life.For the next six to nine months I was in a world of total isolation and fear that I had become insane.  I was paranoid and found links and parallels to my life everywhere I looked.  I became an insommniac and binged heavily on alcohol and food.  This sounds like a nightmare I know but gradually on my own I began the healing process which I compare to a re-birth, like many tribes have rituals of pain, mysticism, bravery etc for the youth to emerge as a man, I believe this was mine, the teenager that entered into this was selfish, petty, spiteful, deceitful, greedy, insecure around girls, obnoxious, smug and many other bad traits.  After about 12 months of sheer hell I began to heal.The moral of this is never underestimate the power and don't automatically think its a cure to all ills. I could quite easily have been in dead through suicide, in prison for commiting a violent act against someone, committed to a mental hospital or simply wandering through life in miserable limbo - instead I am relatively successful, happily married, still enjoy to party with various substances from time to time and consider myself lucky to have gone 'through the rabbit hole' and come out a better person.Exp Year: 1993ExpID: 14047Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Aug 1, 2002Views: 24,911    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Post Trip Problems (8), Depression (15), Health Problems (27), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:8 kgMy first trip was a psychedelic blast.  My girlfriends and I were out watching a band at one of our regular haunts.  The lights were awesome.  We danced all night.  I didn’t drink but I was so happy I spent $50 shouting other people drinks.  Ouch!  Unfortunately this wild night led to a two year tripping binge which totally fucked me up, without me knowing it.Throughout this time I had a few bad trips, many good.  Acid tricks your mind.  I told myself I should never end on a bad trip and of course after a good trip, there was no need to give up.I was a good girl from a good home in a good middle class suburb.  My parents broke up and moved and I felt like I had no real sense of home.  I lived as I chose and I thought this meant I was free, but in all reality I was falling into a lonely life of grungy drugs and rocknroll, which tore at my self-esteem.My worst trip began as a real hoot, as many bad trips do.  My boyfriend and some of his friends and I were driving around in the hills, checking out the forest.  The trees vibrated, leaves pulsed, it was awesome.  We drove up to a huge weir and watched the sun go down.  I remember we were on top of the world up there and I don’t even remember whose idea it was, but one of the guys and I did something terribly stupid, which could have ended in disaster for me.  The stars were bright and the water shone far below and Geoff held me by the ankles and I floated there upside down looking  at the water.  I felt free, truly free and  I remember thinking, if he dropped me I would either break my back or drown, then my boyfriend saw us and said “oy you two, stop being so stupid” and Geoff pulled me back up.  It was really weird.  We laughed and kidded around for a while then went back to the car, which was Geoff’s Mums.  It was dark and Geoff was spinning out so he pulled over and we all just sat there silently in the dark.  The tension was frightening.  I felt negative vibes pouring from Geoff towards me and I felt incredibly vulnerable like I needed to be hugged and loved and I was stuck in this car with four negative yobbos.  I closed my eyes and watched as pictures came, bright moving pictures, of space and time and dimension.  I saw universes inside universes and it freaked me out.  I felt tiny and worthless and miserable and I vowed to give up acid, but it took me another year before I did.  I have used it occasionally since as a party drug, but now I am too old to trouble my brain with it.  I would maybe indulge in a quarter tab at a concert one day but it would have to be damn good outdoor concert.I have smoked pot off and on over the years, much more on than off though.  I wish I smoked less but I don’t.  I have had difficulty finishing things, finding myself and I have noticed that in research of former LSD users this is quite common.  The experience I had both at the weir and after in the car, were so huge, that they numbed me spiritually for about five years.  Since then I have been lucky to find God and Goddess in nature and feel the natural highs of life without chemical drugs.  After much growth and finding myself I have recently come to notice how much the casual drug use I grew up with, has affected me for the negative.  I have suffered from depression at times although I have tried to hide it from myself.  Denial is my middle name.  I had low self-esteem and endured crappy relationships because I felt like a cracked fragile person.  I am now finally seeing some successes in my life, through following my heart, my intuition, God and Goddess.I still feel like I need to learn people skills, like many acid heads, I have hidden away from the 'real world' for a long time.  I find sustained conversation with strangers difficult because I am always stoned.  I plan to cut down my pot intake soon, maybe give up for a year, and go to uni, start learning again.  I do a lot of research about subjects I am interested in but until recently I have had trouble remembering what I’ve learnt.  I think this is more the pot than the lsd but who knows?I would give up pot today if I could stop kidding myself I need it to have creative thought as a writer.  Perhaps by admitting this now I am half way there.Exp Year: 1985ExpID: 14111Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Aug 1, 2002Views: 15,285    LSD (2) : Various (28), Post Trip Problems (8), Depression (15), Bad Trips (6), Retrospective / Summary (11) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:10 kgI've enjoyed taking a look through some of these accounts of 'Trips', the good, the bad and the ugly. I wonder if anyone else who's had a bad trip and read some of the other stories here has felt a loosening of the sphincter reading other people's nightmare episodes?! :)It's been about eight years since I last took any form of hallucinogen , at this time I cannot say whether I ever will again.  I tend to have the opinion that whatever path you take in life, one way or another we all reach the same conclusion and our experience then takes us across the divide to places where we won't tell the living our tales.  Anyway, I digress.Acid! The following account is an example of one very bad trip in around 30 good ones, but it's so far out there I thought I'd cover the bad stuffbefore the good.About ten years ago I bought my third trip from a guy in my home town Norwich (UK) It was a 'Strawberry' and I was told it had been double dipped. The guy had a reputation for selling good acid so I happily gave him my cash . My being in Norwich was just a social visit over a couple of days and catching up with friends. On the last day there I decided to drop the tab and use my friends house as 'Trip HQ' He knew what I was up to, he had gone to work and left me his keys to make myself at home.  I began to come up on the acid towards the lunch time. It was to be the first and last time I'd ever trip alone . Outside it was a glorious sunny day but I was happy enough in my temporary sanctuary to even think about going outside. The LSD rush started blazing up my spine and racing through my guts, I felt a little uneasy with it but had enough mind to allow myself to just go with it and wait until the rush plateaued. It did just that a little later , I'd decided to sit in the upstairs of the house and listen to music on the radio in a sunlit bedroom . I was having a wonderful time , watching floral Escher type patterns breathing over my skin , I enjoyed looking in the mirror looking at my grinning face with very distinct map contour patterns gently washing over my flesh . Its seemed like a great start eh ?Well, I vaguely recall deciding to go downstairs again for some reason then the next thing I recall was awakening on the floor of the dining room alone. The first thing I noticed was that there were blowflies buzzing around a bowl of catfood on the kitchen floor (Which was in view) I remember feeling perplexed as to why both flies had two bright neon after images in red and blue . I sat up and tried to figure out why I was on the floor in the first place . Now its worth pointing out before I take you down my helter skelter that somehow because of my black out , I'd completely forgotten that I'd taken anything at all . Prior to tripping I'd also written myself a note of reassurance in case things got too weird. So, sitting up on the floor still, I found my note and tried to read it. Alas because I was acid addled the words made no sense to me . Instead they morphed like alien glyphs and danced around on the piece of paper. It was then that my last little link to sanity crumbled and I heard my voice utter the terrifying words 'I've gone mad!' I had a feeling that I had to be somewhere else which then got heightened by the digital watch I was wearing suddenly bleeping a time alarm at me but I had no idea why or what it meant .So I left my sanctuary , I later found out that I left the back door wide open thus making the house entirely a burglar's free for all (Fortunately without that as a repercussion). I remember walking almost on auto pilot down a busy street heading towards town, I saw one of my old school teachers who also saw me, but the only thing I did was force a grin and keep on walking. I did indeed walk, not so much as a conscious effort or with any sense of intent, I felt utterly out of control.  I collided withsomeone carrying their shopping-vaguely heard them cuss at me as I continued in my stride, I turned down a passageway between two houses and strolled though the backdoor of a house I'd once lived in, past the new inhabitant and out the front door. I walked into the city center from there - I still don't know how I survived crossing roads but I did. I strolled into a city cafe where my friend's son was working, he saw me and said hello, but in my acid addled state of autopilot I just walked past him into the main cafe and sat down, then I stood up and walked out of the cafe without uttering a word.Other than being completely out to lunch on LSD at that time in the trip , I don't recall hallucinating, moreover I was more a puppet on a string guided by some subconscious walking mechanism which had its own design on where I should be, there was certainly no cognitive thinking to my actions. After the brief cafe episode of the trip, the situation just went from bad to worse.Somehow I'd navigated myself through Norwich during the busy lunchtime shoppers and begun to head in the direction of the city's central park 'Chapelfield gardens'. As a child I'd always felt a sense of friendliness and comfort there. Now in my fried state the familiar comfort of this park had shifted to its polar opposite, I was now hallucinating on top of everything else. The people in the park were all walking around but my perception had begun to distort their heads and faces beyond any form of human recognition. If you could imagine for a moment being surrounded by people in a busy place where their heads had been removed and replaced by Squids and Octopus you might begin to accurately picture the scene confronting me in the park. Everyone had tentacles smothering their faces and dangling down their necks like fleshy snake beards, even the women and children were not exempt from this disfiguration. The octopoid heads were white in appearance and each person seemed to have baleful staring eyes where their ears should have been. Even in my state of auto pilot I felt nothing but sheer terror at the alien swarm of people walking around me .My feet had obviously decided to make evasive maneuvers because I then found myself out of the park having crossed yet another treacherous main road and was now heading towards a multi storey apartment block. I recall that I got inside the building somehow and wandered in circles on one of the floors of the apartment block, I seemed stuck in a loop of wanting to get out, walking around a circle of short corridors and arriving at a janitors cupboard, I would open the door expecting to find an exit and be confronted by a dead end with cleaning products and brooms. I would repeat this several times like a fly that desperately flies in circles around a kitchen only to collide with the same window again and again. I don't remember how I finally broke the loop but I did.The next thing that happened was the memory of walking around some side streets, into someones back garden via an alley way, I recall a middle aged woman looking a little afraid of me being in her yard and rushing into her house closing the door behind her.  I left the yard and I think I walked between two garages, the gap between them was tight, perhaps I tried to go through it anyway, In my mind I was a being trapped inside an ever tightening spiral that I relentlessly marched along. As the spiral tightened my body would begin to crush, if I were to continue down the spiral I would surely be crushed to my final atom...I must have snapped out of that little loop of fractal thought mental torture, I was now adjacent to a main road in Norwich called 'Unthank road' I was in a front garden of another house, the inside of my mouth felt like plant matter, when I tried to scream, my tongue shot out as a mix of flesh and thorny rose stem. The situation was utterly hopeless, and getting ever worse with each lysergic eternal minute.  Over the other side of Unthank road from where I stood was a dental repair workshop, a discreet looking workplace that looked just as much part of the houses above it.  I recall that I walked into this workshop to the surpriseof the men who were working there, I think they said 'Hey, where do you think you're going' etc, but I was too far gone and on my way out again still under the guidance of this momentum and hidden agenda of the auto pilot within me.The adjacent side street began the final demise of my terrifying trip, you'll have to indulge me in this part and go with the flow of reality and abstract woven together.  First off, like a lemming I walked across this side road, onto the pavement then promptly plummeted a good seven ft into someones basement flat, there had probably been a flight of steps leading down to this concrete pit but I didn't see them and wouldn't have known what to do with them if I had. I guess I clambered up to street level again and limped my way up this street which was a bit of a cul de sac. Part of my subconscious memory must have recalled that an ex girlfriend had lived at the end of the street. I found myself walking up to her old front door which was one of those aluminium framed, double glazed types. I recall my reflection looking somewhat like a Francis Bacon painting, a mixture of anguished flesh and black oils ripping like blood down my body .I was falling in eternal darkness, like a fleshy sack of bricks. As I fell forever I would crash through intermittent panes of glass which would shatter and tear me in my never ending descent.  With the sound of breaking glass was the wavering crescendo of the word 'Mad' repeating in waves...mad, Mad, MAD,MAAAD, MAAAAAD, MAD, Mad, mad...over and over as Iplummeted, ripped and torn in darkness with splinters of glass falling beside me.Back on the street a voice was saying 'There is a way out of this, there is a word, and if it all ever gets too much you just say'_____________' and a door will open to allow you away from here 'Back on the street I had staggered a few more paces then fallen.  I was now a seven year old child lying on the pavement, my best friend's parents stood over me feeling concerned 'What happened', 'He's hit his head', 'Call an ambulance'. A disk shaped hole appeared above me with someones arm reaching down to me to try and pull me up into safety, I tried to reach the grasping hand but couldn’t. Then the hole disappeared. I was staggering along the street again at the bottom of the cul de sac.My gaze lifted to the sky and the sky's gaze fell upon me, each cloud was now a giant type of amoeba type organism, covered in dots which pulsed in colour like the skin of a cuttlefish, each giant amoeba had a giant blue human looking eye observing me.  I could hear voices taunting me, telling me I was stupid, telling me how thick I was for looking for the answers , telling me I had spastic consciousness. The amoebas seemed to be singing a never ending song which was something like this...'I'm an umpsquamadic peel and if I ever know what I feel, then I know that I felt like this before and I always knew what I was timely for...' (Repeat into infinity with a chorus of about 1000 people !)I briefly saw existence as a giant clock face of a billion dots between each second , the dots were ticking forward in a relentless advance like the movement of a second hand. Each dot was the equivalent of someone's lifetime. The internal monologue described that living and dying was part of this eternal chain, It showed me that there was a gap of nothing at the point which marked 12 on the clock face and that was a one second break from the never ending cycle of existence that any soul would have. Then the monologue started laughing at my dismay.In reality, I briefly became conscious enough to recognize that I was stumbling through a small childrens play area at the base of the cul de sac. It's worth describing to you a little about the geography of where I was. Adjacent to the cul de sac is a small path which leads to about four flights of stone steps leading to a street below. This street is called 'Park lane'. If you go through the gap in the fence at the back of the children's play area there is a steep foliage ridden embankment that leads down to a flint gravel parking area at the rear of a Park lane hotel. Guess which route I took!In reality I passed through the gap in the fence, failed to notice the dangerous drop below me then tumbled down the embankment onto the flint parking area. I was crawling on my hands and knees by this point.  A piece of flint had torn the palm of my hand making it look like a stigmata wound which was pretty appropriate to the following delusion...I was in a place that looked like 'The sea of holes' from the Beatles' 'Yellow submarine' movie. This was a white void with an infinity of swarming black dots, I could hear air raid sirens and the sound of buzzing, In the sea of holes was a giant cross which had a festering bloody pile of guts and organs spread across it staining the wood crimson. The guts were smothered in wasps stinging the ruined flesh causing venomous pustules.  It was an image of impossible pain.  Then the monologue returned booming over the sirens and drone of the wasps 'This is Christ, he's still suffering for your sins, still paying the price...' Morelaughter, then a fleeting moment of reality. I had crawled across Park lane and collapsed in the gutter on the other side of the road, my jacket was gone, there were cuts and grazes over my bare arms. A wasp had landed by my elbow and was making a snack for itself on one of my cuts.  I remember trying to brush it away and it stinging me as I did. Over the other side of the street I saw a woman pushing a pram and looking at me with concern but now I had returned to acid Hell again. My body was agiant mass of green flesh punctured all over by cactus like thorns that had grown from within and broken my skin on the way out. I had no arms or legs, I was more like a mass of tendrils with an apple shaped mass at the top. My form was that of pain, nothing more and nothing less.A brief flash of a police car pulling up beside me, someone getting out ...I was pain , floating in the sea of holes, there were a billion holes, each one a passage leading to another identical ocean of swarming black dots. The monologue told me there was only one whole which lead away from here...I was in a hospital, lying on a padded vinyl mattress with medics standing around me, I was human shape again. The doors of the room I was in swung open to reveal an idyllic country side scene of green hilly pastures, bathed in glorious sunlight and a friendly looking old Oak tree in the foreground view, if only I could crawl through those doors I would be safe, my soul saved.  But I couldn't move, the doors swung shut then opened again, now I could see a hospital corridor instead of the fields, someone was being pushed past on a stretcher trolley.Back in the sea of holes it seemed that my gaze in any direction would erase the back dots in their masses, for the first time in this nightmare trip I felt a sense of conscious hope. I began to wipe swathes of dots by sweeping glances into the void around me...'What have you taken ?'I was gaining hope by the minute, stripping the black dots away , removing these taunting false exits...'What have you taken?  Was it acid ?'Surrounded by a self created white void of comfort I gazed at the final bunch of black dots and knew my release from Hell was merely held by these remaining few ...'He's out of it still.'I had gazed all but two of the black dots away, these two now had a bridge akin to a line seen in a dot to dot puzzle.  In my mind my voice returned as I stared at each dot, I heard my own internal voice yelling 'One Two, One, Two, One one, Two...' Then, the two dots looked like my own hands with cuffs around them. The black line bridge had become a visiblechain, the white void had faded to become a hospital room. I was in fact on my back on a hospital bed with my arms trapped beneath me, I was looking through my legs at my wrists grazed with the rubbing pressure of police hand cuffs around them.  Then I yelled, 'Get these fucking hand cuffs off me !'In the room with me were a male and female police officer from the Norfolk constabulary, they had obviously been the people who had lifted me from the Park lane gutter and taken me to hospital. The male officer obliged my demand and removed the cuffs. The woman police officer asked me stuff like my name, If I knew where I was, but the best I could muster was a briefgroan. They both looked a bit frustrated and left me in the room on the hospital bed alone. I was rapidly regaining my sense of self and conscious of reality. I recalled that I had indeed dropped acid sometime earlier, my Hospital surroundings and the amount of cuts and bruises I had were confirmation to me that whatever I'd done, It had seriously backfired big time!I sat on the edge of the hospital bed, noted a number of missing Items I had recalled having on my person prior to all of this . I found my pumps in the bedside cabinet and put them on. Then I took my first deliberate steps across the room I was in. The bizarre nature of this entire episode had one final twist installed for me. I recall walking to the door of my single bed room and opening it, a few feet away from me were the two police officers facing each other having an intense conversation about what to do about me. They were so engrossed in their discussion that neither noticed as I came out of the room and begun walking down the hospital corridor. There was a window that stood from floor to ceiling, the type that pivots in the central vertical axis, so judging that I could fit through the gap, I squeezed through it.There is little left to tell of this story, except to say my walk from the hospital to the train station was quite distressing, I was in a lot of pain . had stitches in my chin, my elbow and hand. My right forearm had swollen up purple making it look like Popeye's right hook.  I was still semi-hallucinating but very aware of how I'd nearly died and how I had a lot of explaining to do when I got home to my girlfriend. There were no legal repercussions for giving the police the slip , I had caught a train back home to a village in Suffolk which was not in the jurisdiction of the Norfolk constabulary, however they had contacted my father who was in Norfolk , so I had quite a bit of explaining to do for him too!If anyone is interested in seeing some of the visuals I had during that hellish day, I have (The last time I looked) a website partly dedicated to the episode which can be found at geocities.com/hellclouds4, as well as an artist's page on Erowid.In retrospect, it was the worst day of my entire life. It was the closest I can imagine to having full blown psychosis. I think it was nothing short of a miracle that I didn't end up over someones car bonnet or worse. Do I believe the monologues and symbols of that day?  I'm not entirely sure I do, I now understand that intense adrenalin bursts whilst hallucinating are responsible for dragging the mind into the abyss of fear and worst possible scenarios. I kind of feel that I would have a very bleak outlook for life and reality if I believed for a moment that anything I saw in that trip was true. I've had some other trips which were glorious and the polar opposite of that day (You will find more of my accounts of these here soon ). So I tend to agree with Aldous Huxley that Heaven and Hell are both valid states of consciousness. It all depends on where the person is at and how we navigate through the psychedelic state which determines which destination we arrive at. If anything puzzles me at all about that day, It would have to be the black out I experienced early in the trip, I suspect that had I not lost consciousness I would probably have not forgotten that I took the drug and therefore wouldn't have panicked myself into an internal Hell fractal.Exp Year: 1991ExpID: 15729Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Aug 5, 2002Views: 30,614    LSD (2) : Various (28), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Bad Trips (6), General (1) DOSE: T+ 0:001 hitoralLSD(pill / tablet)  T+ 1:001 hitoralLSD(pill / tablet)BODY WEIGHT:140 lbI had experimented with different psychedelic drugs from age 16 and taken LSD many times, always enjoyable and sometimes inspiring.   On 1/4/69 we were given some red tablets of LSD that had a solid reputation among our peers for being very 'clean' yet strong. Normally I always made sure to trip on nice days with a close friend or two.  This time however we dropped about 7:30 PM and the weather was cold, dark and wintry.   After taking one tab, about an hour later we were having some very intense and pleasant visual color hallucinations and body rushes, so like fools, we decided to 'intensify' and drop another tab (stupid...  I almost never do this, as I end up coming on to one dose and starting to peak on the earlier dose at the same time).About an hour later as the second tab was starting to hit hard, every sensation (visual, audio, sensual/physical, .. all senses) that had previously been pleasant began to 'mutate' into discomfort.  It was accompanied by anxiety, extreme nervousness, and it became impossible & uncomfortable to sit, lie down or stand still.   I could not bear to look at anything, listen to anything, feel anything, stand or sit anywhere, talk to anyone, or be by myself.  I could not breathe without concentrating every muscle in my upper chest to do so.  Time slowed to a crawl.  All I wanted to do was get out of my body & mind, escape my skin, or somehow find a way to make this  experience stop immediately.  These awful sensations continued to intensify for another hour until neither I nor my friends knew what to do.  Like unprepared fools, we had no thorazine, etc.   Fearing I was either going to go insane or die, my companions eventually decided that, cops be damned, they were going to call an ambulance.They gathered up all drugs/paraphenalia,etc. in the apartment, called the hospital, and left.   I did not want them to stay and have to deal with hostile cops, risking arrest...don't forget, they were tripping heavily too, though not bumming like I was.  In those days, anyone involved in any type of drug-related situation went directly to jail.They left the front door open for the medics and police.   I lay in bed in the back bedroom until I heard the ambulance siren coming in the distance.Two cops came in first, shined a flashlight in my face, determined it was safe for the medics, and then I was strapped to a guerney and taken downstairs, outside, and placed in the ambulance.At about that same time, just as it felt things could get no worse, as I lay strapped on the guerney in the ambulance all of a sudden there was a strong sensation inside my head that could only be described as feeling something bursting and then 'melting' over my brain.  Instead of causing more pain or anxiety, it had the opposite effect, best described as a gradual and merciful release of pressure inside my skull.  I slowly began to sink into a quiet, almost comatose state, but still awake and with my eyes slightly open.  I still remember vividly how intense the wildly swirling colors were inside and outside the ambulance as the paramedic drove through the cold night with the bright spinning overhead ambulance lights on but quietly cruising without the siren to the hospital.By the time we arrived and I had been transferred to a bed in the emergency room, I had already begun to recover.  After about a half an hour of examination and some continued, repetitive & ridiculous inquisition from emergency room nurses ('What's your name?   how old are you,' etc.) I was left alone.   Unbelievably I hopped out of the bed and began to walk around the emergency ward, tripping out like some space cadet on all the gunshot victims, attempted suicides, etc. and remarkably feeling almost completely recovered and relaxed.  Trippin' in the trauma center...Out of curiosity, boredom I went through all the drawers near my bed.  I helped myself to a few souvenirs, including some ammonia poppers and a hemostat that later on became a great roach clip.Souvenirs in hand (pockets actually) I proceeded to walk out of the hospital.  In all the weekend emergency-room chaos, only one person on staff noticed I was leaving.  He asked me where was I going and told me I had to stay until I was released by a doctor.  I replied that I was fine, and 'I'm getting the hell out of here.'Instead of protesting or calling a cop he pushed a hospital form in my face and said, 'Sign this, .. it says you've been treated.'  I laughed, so did he, I signed the paper and walked out the door into the street.  I walked all the way home (about 3 miles) through the city streets, still tripping mildly and very relieved to have survived a truly awful night virtually (I thought) unscathed.A week later I convinced myself I should not let this one negative experience scare me out of regular and recreational LSD use.   Like a stubborn idiot ('get back on the horse') I got some more of the exact same acid from the same guy and dropped one tab again.About an hour later, there were almost no rushes or colors, but I began to feel the exact same type of symptoms & anxieties again, only greatly reduced in intensity.    I decided that my body/brain, nature/whatever was trying to tell me that I had been pushing my luck too often.  I had been taking increasing amounts more frequently & trying to regain the initial 'magic' feeling I had felt when I first took LSD, without giving my mind/body/psyche enough time to take it all in and recover.  In short.... the party was over.   I continued to occasionally experience minor flashbacks and brief but noticeable anxiety attacks for approximately 6 months to 1 year after 'hell night' & didn't completely recover and return to normal (whatever that is) until about 12 months later.   Even smoking a little marijuana had the effect of bringing on minor anxiety, paranoia and flashbacks. I stopped taking drugs of any kind for about 4 years.I consider myself fortunate to be able to look back and laugh at my immature and reckless stupidity and lack of respect for what is a very powerful substance.  IMHO, LSD should to be treated with respect.  I now enjoy cannabis (I love Amsterdam and go there occasionally for a month or so to sample the world-class weed & hash), but I doubt that I will ever find a reason or desire to take acid again.    I enjoyed LSD and must have tripped happily and successfully about 25 times, which for me was more than enough to retain some insight and something positive from the experience. I feel great, and since my mind and spirit ain't broke, I'm not going to try to fix it.I hope no one reading this ever has a bad trip like the one described above, and that your LSD experiences are peaceful, pleasant, fun and enlightening.Exp Year: 1969ExpID: 18533Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 30, 2002Views: 47,906    LSD (2) : Retrospective / Summary (11), Post Trip Problems (8), Bad Trips (6), Hospital (36) DOSE: T+ 0:002 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 3:30  repeatedinsufflatedCocaine(powder / crystals)BODY WEIGHT:70 kgI've taken a fair amount of acid the past few years, but none at all the past 5 or 6 months.Last night I took 2 papertrips -'blotter' a madhatter and a california sunshine, I was at a friends house, who refused to do acid, this is because of bad comments passed to him about the drug, he said he'd wait and see how well i was doing before he'd munch 1... so we are alone, music was playing, mainly listen to soft rock (Limp Bizcit, Korn -some house) mood was awsome, have no fears of parents rocking up or just uninvited guests...I munched at about 21:30, he ditched me a while to go and get some coke for him, and later, save some for me...So I felt all the usual about 45 minutes later, things start moving, etc... and I noticed an ant that appeared to be many ants after about 5 minutes (I think 5 minutes), this ant just became more and more ants, it was hectic and i thought I should take the show to another room till he got back...It bothered me to walk to the next room, cause it was like replacing your thoughts of that room in another room, I didn't feel comfortable once, uptight, metalic taste in my mouth, my eyes kept on delaying...I walked into his glass sliding door and this was completely hectic, cause that moment just kept on playing back in my head, and I felt like I was to be carefull of where I was walking and not to stand on anything..(there is nothing to stand on).He got back at about 22:15 and when he walked in the first thing he said was, 'did you notice the sliding door?' and that just freaked me out. Were ants everywhere or I was just too scared to want to notice ants, and he didn't know about the sliding door, he meant that he just that day had a sliding door put into his lounge... this is not how I thought of it though...I thought he knew...He had the coke and began cutting the shit on his glass table, it looked dirty and unclean in full meaning of the word, I felt like my life was going to end with a line...like that line could ruin my life, I mean 'it is cocaine you know'We wondered around his house for a while talking and laughing at weird and sort of storyless pictures hung on his walls, it depressed me how he could have a picture of his grandmother on the wall and right next to it have a picture of 2 dwarf mime artists playing tricks on each other, something about that made me think of treachery and just then I started to discover(in my head) that his whole family are treacherous toward each other and just some things made me think of him becoming treacherous toward me, and I became more uncalm and more hectic and I couldn't look at him the same...I thought he would at some point stab me, and do things to me that would end our friendship...I couldn't handle the sight of him, and he kept on pushing me for an answer... wanting to know why I couldn't trust him or talk to him, to me it was like he was starting to torture me for something I wouldn't tell him...He kept on telling me, 'dude the acid is fucking you up' like over and over again he would tell me this... and he tried to explain that he is one of my best friends and that he would never fuck me around... or backstab me in anyway...he convinced me to have a line of coke with him, but all the way to doing this...it was about 01:00 and we sat infront of the table with the 'c' and we just talked and shit looked like it was engulfing him and I felt like I was about to become a victim of lies, so I grabbed the card and told him that I should cut the line...I was adamant to cut the lines, and he said to me: 'dude, you are like my brother (but looked like he meant it) why tha fuck would I want to do these things, you are never munching acid with me again, and I am never taking this shit.' I cut the lines about 4cm's long and about 3mm thick, I shnarfed first, as soon as my head rose, for some reason I laughed in such a cynical way and (a burst) he looked at me and I just saw him as like my protector, and the hallucinations toned down by like 80% and I was on an elite coke vibe, plenty of depth in thought (but in a realistic manner) I felt completely comfortable as he shnarfed his line, and he said to me when he rose from the table, 'I lost you just now, and where ever you were, you are not taking me there.'No more acid for ME, no more acid EVER, not in this lifetime, depending on the music and vibe and place, things can become so sick and twisted that I forget reality so harshly that people can look by 1 action like they are conspiring against you...The coke helped me to forget my fantasy (this was chaos) always talking about how fun the world would be in complete Anarchy...LSD helped me to realise that it was the world I created for myself, but that world will help me to only become more Chaotic in my head if I continue to be rebelious in words and in action...Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 7274Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 19, 2003Views: 49,465    LSD (2), Cocaine (13) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Relationships (44), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5) DOSE:9 hitsoralLSD(gel tab) 4 hitssmokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:180 lbI am a friend of the person who was in this particular experience. He has told me exactly what to write, and I will write from his 1st person perspective.This story takes place in Atlanta. I am 18 years old.I had done LSD several times before this occurance. Each time had been the most pleasing of experiences, I had ventured through my thoughts and each time come out happily, seemingly on top of the world. Little did I know, my next trip would not be so beautiful...It was a Friday night. That week at school I had done poorly on a couple of tests and when my parents found out they gave me hell. They called me stupid and threatened to send me to military school, you know, all the shit. I had also been having problems with my girlfriend. She found out that I had been doing drugs(I had not informed her, as she was not particularly fond of them). I tried to reason with her, but she would not have it. Our relationship continued to deteriorate until finally we broke up on the Thursday prior.Well back to Friday night, I obviously had not been feeling too happy, so I decided to meet up with a few friends as a sort of pick-me-up. I met three of my friends at the movie theater, and one of them told me they had scored some LSD. One of the main rules of tripping is to always think good thoughts and be happy prior to your trip. This was where I made my mistake. I was incredibly depressed, but I decided to just fuck it and down 9 gel tabs. Ohhh shit why...My friends also had some, I am not sure how much.We decided to go out to my friends car before the movie and smoke a few bowls. I had four. We then proceeded to see 'The Ring', FUCKING HUGE MISTAKE. GOD DAMMIT I was a retard for seeing that damn movie while tripping. Everything started out normal before the movie started. I was watching previews and the colors on the screen swirled and twisted in shape. They were so beautiful. I was sure this was going to be a pleasant trip, I would be brought out of my depression. Haha, wow was I fucking wrong...So the movie started, and immediately I am transported to a world of fear and horror. If you have seen the ring, then you know the part where you see the girl in the closet, and her horribly contorted face. When I saw that, my friends and I completely lost it. We sprinted out of the theater screaming. I am pretty sure I was crying. I had never seen anything scarier in my life, but becasue I was tripping, I kept seeing the image over, and over again, as if the girl was right next to me. We luckily spotted another one of our friends (he was sober tonight). We told him what was going on and he was nice enough to drive us to my friends house, as we were obviously incapable. I looked out the window and I saw shadows instantly twist shape and turn into perverse faced demons. One shadow looked like fingers, and it turned into an arm that reached out and attempted to grab me and pull me down to hell. This arm had a voice. A deep, mysterious, terrifying voice, almost like the one of Indred Cold from The Mothman Prophecies. I pissed my pants I was so scared. We finally arrived home.I felt as if this feeling would never go away as we walked into my friends basement. It was extremely dark down there, and in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing a terrifying, demented, evil face staring its deranged, menacing eyes into my eyes. My friends had kind of cooled down, but not me. We decided to smoke some more bowls to lift our moods. When it was my turn, I lit the zippo and I saw the flame, twisting twirling right in front of me. I was perplexed by it, I had never seen anything more interesting in my life. But out of nowhere, all the sudden the flame just exploded in my eyes and was the length of the room. I then saw dark figures crawling out of the flame, obviously coming to take me away. I sat there, quivering in fear. My hands were shaking so hard that I dropped the zippo and it fell on my leg. I sat there and saw it burning a hole through my pants and burning my leg, but I could not feel it.Luckily, my friend noticed what was going on and knocked the zippo off my leg and my other friend picked it up and started to stare at it in pleasureful wonder. I wished I could feel that way. I started to cry, just all out cry. Why were my friends so much better off than me? Why the fuck does God hate me? I then started to scream, just scream my lungs out. My friend came over and pulled his hand back and slapped me vigorously across the face. I watched the motion of his hand and it seemed like 50 hands were coming across and slapping me, one by one. I had to retaliate. I took the lamp off the table next to me and threw it at his head. The glass lamp shattered across his face and he slumped to the floor. The light had singed his hair and his face was dripping with blood. It made me happy to see him in pain, to see somebody else going through the same thing I was. My two other friends weren't even watching as I got on top of my nearly unconcious friend and started beating him senseless with anything I could find.Thankfully, his parents sprinted down the basement stairs and saw what was happening. They stopped me from potentially and unknowingly killing my friend. My two other friends had know idea what was going on because they were over in the other corners of the dark room tripping hard. The boys parents flicked on the lights and I was blinded by the light. I jumped off the boy and started to sprint out the door, where I jumped through a window thinking I was a hawk. Of course, we were in the basement, so I luckily just landed on the ground in front of me. The boy's parents called 911.All of us were taken to the hospital, we had mostly come down from the trip by now. My friend was lying unconcious, barely alive, I had just now realized what I had done. I just had a broken left arm and some deep cuts from jumping through the window, but nothing like my friends wounds. The rest of us were taken to the police station for questioning. I admitted to ingesting the LSD but not to beating my friend. My friends admitted to nothing and wound up getting out scot free, fuckers...But I was charged with assault and battering, and I had some geltabs in my pocket, so they charged me with drug possession too. I have been charged as an adult, so I am currently in jail, my friend visited me and took down this story. I am going to court soon, where they will ultimately find me out, they already told me they know I'm guilty, I have no case. I am fucked, royally fucked. I am still suffering from psycological trauma. LSD has taken my life down the tubes, but its really my own fault. I hope, somehow, I get the death sentence, because death would be better than this lifestyle.The moral of the story is, don't fuck up. Don't trip when you are depressed and always trip with somebody sober. I didn't listen to the advice I read on the net, and now look at me...please, give me your prayers.Exp Year: 2002ExpID: 20041Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Mar 9, 2003Views: 46,746    Police / Customs (60), LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Second Hand Report (42), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:4 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)   smokedCannabis BODY WEIGHT:170 lbAbout 4-5 months ago I had an acid trip that completely blew my mind.  I had stopped at a friends house to say hey, and he asked me if I wanted any doses.  I said yeah, and bought his last four.  He told me they were really strong and clean, and to be careful.  Before I begin, let me give a little background that should make this trip a little clearer to anyone reading.  I am 22 and until about eight months ago I was living in a house with four guys, going to school, and doing a lot of drugs.  I have always enjoyed psychedellics, but never among many people.  I was more interested in exploring myself with close friends, or even by myself.  But a couple of weeks before fall semester my girlfriend revealed she was preganant.  So I moved back home (30 mins. away) to where she lived and we moved in and began preparing for our child.  This meant a big change to my way of life.  While I didn't want to abandon my thoughts and beliefs, I realized that certain things had to change.  The days of caring about nothing were over, that's how I felt and still do.  But it was tough, and I was not willing to completely give up my psychedellic experiences.  Well, as it turned out, my mind was stronger than the LSD.Back to the experience.  My girlfriend was about four months preganant, and I decided I was going to eat this acid.  And while I have no good excuse for doing it, I ate all four hits, with the intention of tripping with myself for the evening.  I ate the doses as we were getting in the car to go to the store (figuring I had plenty of time to get to the store and back before anything really happened).  Well the store is only maybe 10-15 minutes away, and when we got there I was already tripping (my friend wasn't lying!).  I said that we can't stay here, so we left.  We had to get gas on the way home, and the whole time at the gas station (maybe t+35) I felt like I was going to explode.  So we quickly got home.  I felt better, more secure, being at home.  But by now (maybe t+1:15) I was tripping harder than any peak i'd ever had.  But I was fine, at home and at ease (somewhat).This is where stuff gets out of hand.  A day or two before, at work, I had threatened a customer who got out of hand with my girlfriend.  They called the cops.  They (the cops) came over later that night but I wasn't home, they talked to my girlfriend. So now there was a knock at the door, and all I could think was that it was the cops, they would want to talk (which I couldn't), search the place, find stuff, and my whole world I had been working so hard for would be over.  I can't explain the horror I felt.  My girlfriend took me in the bedroom and didn't answer the door.  I was no longer in reality and couldn't figure out quite what was happening ( turns out it was just a friend coming over to say hey).  By the time I got calmed down I was tripping so hard that I didn't really even realize I had eaten acid.  I was in another world, I guess.  I'm sure that many other have been where, or gone much farther, than I was.  But when you reach a point where you are tripping so hard that you feel like you're in reality, and have no conscious thought of taking any mind-altering substance, then you had better have a strong head (which I did not).At this point my good friend called and wondered what was going on, and if I had any greenery.  I was so thrilled to hear the voice of a good friend that it was almost orgasmic.  I felt as though everyone knew what had happened that night, and we were all on the same level.  I said I just wanted him to come over and smoke and hang out, like old times.  In the meantime, I managed somehow to put on some Hendrix, and everything became peaceful.  Stars were in my living room, and everything had become right.  After worrying that someone was at my house, ready to take everything I've worked for, I finally felt peaceful.  Thinking back, the crazy thought is that I hadn't even come close to peaking yet, and already so much had been processed.My friend, along with one of his friends, finally arrived and we went to my basement to hang out.  It was great, I felt completely connected to everyone, mostly my good friend who I normally feel real close to.  But we began to smoke, and reality was no more.  I can not even explain what happened for the next hour or two.  Too intense.  My friends left and I apparently had no idea I was alone.  My girlfriend came downstairs at one point to find me dancing around with a bag of grass flying everywhere.  I vaguely remember different, weird things.O.K. now, thanks for listening so far, because this is the part of the trip I want, and need, to get out.  At some point I came upstairs.  I noticed I was drenched in sweat.  I knew now that I had eaten acid.  I couldn't account for the last hour or two or three. My girlfriend was in bed, and I was by myself.  All of a sudden everything went from psychedelic and colorful to a nightmarish black and white.  I noticed I was covered in sweat.  'oh my god, what has happened' ( I now realize this was my peak).  I couldn't account for any time before right now.  Had I 'whigged out'.  Was I even in my house.  I couldn't tell, and somehow I was aware that I could be imagining everything.  Then i really did 'whig out'.  I thought that I had gone crazy.  I woke my girlfriend up and was screaming for her to get my friend over here, the one who was over earlier, to tie me up.  I didn't think I was even in my house anymore.  Even though I appeared to be there (warped as it looked), I thought I was in an insane asylum, or was I?  Maybe I was just dying.  Maybe I was in an asylum, or hospital room, and I was dying.  I couldn't tell if I was talking to my girlfriend or what.  Listen, to spare many details that I barely understand, I'll just say this.  In the end, the end of my trip, I thought I was in some kind of tank strapped down, everyone watching me go insane.  I had one last twitch of energy, and then I felt my lungs explode.  I just lay there, feeling that I was now dead and I would never see my child, or my girlfriend, both of whom I already cared so much for.  But it was almost a calm feeling in the end.  I felt it was over.  Why struggle? But then I realized I didn't even have any idea or belief as to what the afterlife was.  I felt for a while that my mind would live on, but that maybe there was a heaven and hell.  I kept thinking I was already in hell, and that my punishment was to relive these last, terrifying phases of my trip forever.  I had let down my child and the woman I loved and I couldn't imagine a worse hell than this, but somehow i was calm, everything was somewhat surreal. If you have listened to all of my rambling thus far, I just want to say this to end.  I was dead, not physically, but mentally.  When I finally came to, and realized my friend did come back (after my girlfriend called him), and that everything would be fine, I was too overwhelmed.  I cannot express the magnitude of fear and terror I felt, just after feeling so perfect for a while.  I would never want to repeat this again, but now that it is over I wouldn't take it back.  I faced all of my fears that night (failing as a father, as a person, as anything) and am still here. I felt I was dead and came to grips with that.  Anybody out there who feels like they are superior to psychedellics are wrong.  LSD, mushrooms, or any other psychedelic are powerful substances which bring the subconcious to the surface.  Even after this event, I feel this is a good thing.  But I made two mistakes that night.  1)I took too much, and 2) My subconscious was not stable.  Since that night I haved live my life much differently.  I now realize that life is beautiful, and I have respect for it.  You get one chance.  To experience death without being dead is too dramatic for any words I can write.  I now live my life to the fullest, and feel like I have a cause.  I have a child, and a beautiful woman who I love and loves me, and that is it.  I still refuse to give up psychedelics, but I have MUCH, MUCH more respect for them, and understand that they have their time and place.  Hopefully, if you are reading this you also take them seriously and realize that they are not a 'way' of life, but a door to let you experience your life in a more complete way, for 'better or for worse'.Exp Year: 2002ExpID: 22310Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Apr 22, 2003Views: 15,161    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Various (28) DOSE: T+ 0:001 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:302 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 2:002.5 mgoralPharms - Alprazolam(pill / tablet)  T+ 2:3015 mgoralPharms - Diazepam(pill / tablet)BODY WEIGHT:68 kgLyserg-Saeure-Diaethylamid (Lysergic acid diethylamide-25) - the brainchild of Dr. Albert Hoffman. This was the first drug I've ever taken and I've had about 35 trips of acid since then. Unfortunately, this substance seems to be rarer these days and I haven't seen it around for years! LSD is not available in Malaysia (at least I've never come across it) and even in Melbourne, there's only rumors that acid is around but no one seems to be able to get hold of any.I recently managed to get in touch with someone who can actually deliver this rare (or so it seems) chemical. The best thing was the price - it's only A$15 for each blotter! It has been 6 years since I've last tripped on acid, and I'm sure glad to see it around, so I bought 3 blotters. The blotter art is a picture of a Buddha with a green face and a blue head piece.I intended to take a single blotter because it's been a while since I've tripped and these Buddha blotters were said to be strong. I perforated one blotter and put it under my tongue and listened to some psy-trance. My past experiences with LSD were always in raves, but I wanted to take it in a safe environment this time to gauge the strength. It was strong acid alright, and I made the mistake of dropping the other two blotters when I felt the first familiar effects take hold.I thought I could handle the experience but I haven't taken into account my frame of mind (not so good) at the time. I knew that taking all three blotters was a mistake when things started getting too intense and I had to shut off the music. I've forgotten the utter mind-fuck that LSD produces and I spent the night reading the Psychedelic Crisis FAQ [erowid.org].I knew deep down that everything was alright and it's just the acid that's fucking with my mind', but if you've taken a high dose of LSD, you know how things can get out of control inside your mind. :) I'll admit it, I was terrified. I know that everything would go back to normal in 10 hours, but everything was so intense, so unstoppable that I had a bad trip. I was utterly blindsided by the strength of these blotters - taking all 3 was a mistake indeed.I know that I'm not going insane. It's just the acid, it'll all be good in 10 hours, I tell myself. I know it's impossible to overdose on LSD (the LD-50 is very, very high) but I was scared that I'll be insane forever. I actually seriously considered checking myself into a hospital! Imagine that! What ludicrous thoughts I entertain in my mind while under the influence! I know it's just the drugs, and I'm really glad I had enough experience to stop things from getting really out of control. I practically tore apart a blister pack of Xanax (alprazolam) in an effort to calm down. 2.5 mg of Xanax didn?t do anything, so I sedated myself with a further 15 mg of Valium (diazepam). I shut down all the lights (to reduce stimulus) and laid in bed with blankets around me, watching the trails as the blankets moved. Closing my eyes produced repetitively green geometric patterns flowing and morphing through my vision and I was getting auditory hallucinations too. I opened my eyes to see a warped room that I could barely recognize, the proportions were wrong and things were too fluid.Finally, the benzos did their magic but I still couldn't sleep. It was a weird state of feeling like I was floating to sleep, and then the acid kicks in and I jerk awake into an unfamiliar room. I was pretty much sedated by then though, so I got up and managed to resume the trip report I was trying to keep. Hah! :) I don't remember much after that, but I know I went out to get some food and saw someone and had to avoid eye contact while getting food. That's about the only thing I remembered clearly before managing to eat and sleep.

I'm utterly humiliated by what I wrote in the trip journal, but I'm going to post it anyway, coz it shows how badly strong psychedelics like LSD can mess with your mind. =D It's disjointed and hard to read, but there you go, everything I wrote posted as is. Buddha taught me how to write the word 'respect' that day.

We decided to let her try acid because we did it a lot and she said she wanted to try it but never had.  There were six of us when we started out.  Everyone dropped 2 hits of red gel and we smoked a blunt while waiting for our trip to kick in.  Normally none of us do coke but our friend had just gotten a large amount of money and bought some for the party.  We did a couple lines each and had something to drink and within an hour we were all starting to feel the acid.  All through the night we just kept smoking weed and drinking and would occasionaly do a line.  At some point we cut out 4 lines (2 of the people didn't want any).  Erica wanted to go first, and without realizing what she was doing, she did all 4 lines.The rest of us just gave each other a kind of weird looked and I could tell they were as concerned as I was.  A few minutes after that Erica started talking about how fucked up she was and stated she had never done as many drugs as we'd done up to that point.  She then went on to tell us she was feeling weird and her heart was beating too fast.  We told her of course it was, that we'd done a lot of drugs but the acid was just worrying her that she was fine and what she was feeling was normal.  She sat down with her beer and seemed to be watching tv so I thought she was fine.  I rolled another blunt and we laced it with some coke.  After I finished I went over to sit where everyone else was so we could smoke.I looked at Erica's eyes and she was staring past the tv, as if it wasn't there, and they were filled with tears and I could see panic and terror all over her face.  I gave the blunt to our friend to light and asked her if she was ok.  She started balling her eyes out crying telling us that she was going to die, she'd done too many drugs.  By this point we were all tripping our balls off and everyone got really quiet.  I'd never saw anyone flip out before on acid although I'd had a few scary experiences with it myself.  I told her she was fine and that the drugs would wear off by morning.  She started shaking uncontrolably and crying more and just saying over and over that she was dying and we were lying to her about her being fine.Then there was a knock on the door, I just knew it was the cops and we were all going to jail, but luckily it wasn't.  It was a couple of my friends coming to see if they could score a couple hits because I'd tried to get them to party w/ us earlier but they had another party to go to.  I invited them in and warned them about Erica flipping out to just be calm around her and not do or say anything crazy.  We joined everyone in the living room and Erica was still sitting in the same spot, face soaked in tears, still trembling.  I was sitting across the room from Erica talking to my friend and I was watching her from the corner of my eye, trying to stay focused on whatever it was my friend was saying.At one point I looked over and Erica was staring at me, looking totally helpless and lost and I swear, even though she wasn't saying anything, she was talking to me.  She was telling me about how she was worried and thought she was dying.  I just smiled at her and in my mind I told her it was all the acid, to trust me.  I told her I knew she was scared and that I didn't know what to do or say to make her feel better, but I knew she should would be fine in a few hours, the acid would be gone, and for her to try not to worry and enjoy it.  At that exact moment Erica smiled back at me and said (none of this was actually said out loud I remind you) I see, I get what you're saying, thank you so much...and at that moment she wiped her face clean of her tears and got up to get another beer.After the 2 guests left the incident went unmentioned because Erica was doing much better and no longer scared and no one wanted to mention it out of fear it'd throw her back into it.  The rest of the night/morning went fine and everyone went to sleep about the time the sun was coming up.A few days later I was asking Erica if she remembered the whole thing when she was wigging out and I was talking to my friend and looked at her and smiled and she said she did and asked why.  I told her about the conversation I had with her in my mind and her face turned pale and she said the exact same conversation went through her head at the same time but she felt stupid about it later and hadn't wanted to say anything.  Every since then she refers to me as 'her alice', which, if you're not familiar with the Jefferson Airplane song 'White Rabbit' that probably doesn't mean much of anything.Sorry that was so long but that was one of the most amazing things I'd ever experienced on acid.  I had never been really good friends with Erica (but very close to the rest of the people at the party) but after that we've been very close friends and refuses to trip any more without me around.But anyway, the moral of the story is that above all else when using LSD, remember, YOU'RE JUST TRIPPIN'.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 7444Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 4, 2003Views: 1,092    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Second Hand Report (42), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), Combinations (3) DOSE:20 dropsoralLSD(liquid)BODY WEIGHT:120 lbI took about 1/5 of my red vial of acid, ON ACCIDENT, I meant to only take 5 or so hits, but I couldnĺt count the drops with my nose in the way, and the vial sprayed. I also took 2 1000 mg vitamin C pills with rose hips (supposed to intensify your trip). 15 minutes later the first traces of the trip started to kick in, just a little head rush and colors seemed stronger (pupil dilation increases the strength of color seen), so we decided to get moving, we went on a 1 mile walk to a mall (bad idea). On the walk, visuals started rushing around.I would watch cars drive by and laugh so hard I fell on the ground. This made both of us very very paranoid, if a cop drove by, we might as well be dead, my friend was on house arrest at the time. We walked around the mall a bit, but all the people were very scary, so we ran home. There I fell on the couch, and ate goldfish ALSO NOT GOOD. Goldfish are very salty, dehydration is not a main concern normally during an acid trip, but I had not gotten anything to drink all day except my milk in the morning, and it was about 6 at night. I tried to ask for a drink, but I couldnĺt talk, ended up staring at the vacuum for about 2 hours, we had a very complex conversation, the vacuum and me.Thatĺs about where I partially blacked out, I remember a few things, and others my mom or my friend told me about. My friend said a little baby was crawling all over my body and I wasnĺt moving. His mom got scared and called the paramedics (shes cool w/ drugs, but she thought I might die). I vaguely remember being carried in the ambulance. I then remember waking up in the hospital and feeling like the whole universe was all about to be gone all becuase I wanted to get high.It felt like I was killing the world and I was hella scared. I do remember the doctor asking me 'how are you feeling?' and I answered 'how should I know?' and he said 'what did you take?' and I said 'everything,' he then said something like 'where did you get it?' and I said 'nowhere.'The doctor, due to my actions, put me in 5 point restraints (tied up both arms, both legs and my torso) and gave me 2 sets of sedatives. They used 2 full bags of IV fluid before I was properly hydrated, and thats when I started to feel human again. Apparently I was violent, they thought I had taken PCP. My mom had come to see me (the hospital called her) and I didnĺt recognize her at all. I thought she was a monster, so when she came at me I tried to bite her.I finally soberized around 1:40, and started to cry when I realized what exactly had happend and how screwed I was, you see my parents had no idea I was doing anything except weed, and his 'overdose,' as the hospital called it, scared the shit out of them.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 7617Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 21, 2003Views: 16,124    LSD (2) : Hospital (36), Overdose (29), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5) DOSE:4 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:145 lbThis all happened about 7 years ago, but I still remember most of the night quite clearly.  You see - I was sober at the time (ok, maybe a bit stoned - but I smoked every day so it was pretty much 'normal'), along with all my other trip-buddies.  However - the psychedelic virgin of our bunch had decided to dose 4 hits of the white blotter we were always so able to acquire.I was in college, and it was my first year at Savannah College of Art and Design.  I lived in a dorm room with about 6 other guys.  I came to find out they all liked to eat as much acid as I did, and after about 2 weeks in school we already had a solid connection from a florida pipeline, about 2 people removed from the chemist.  I was already somewhat of a LSD veteran by the time I got to college, averaging 6-8 blotters per weekly trip for the past few years before... and therefore I was able to really appreciate the STRENGTH and size of the white blotters we were getting at SCAD.  We had tons of the stuff on hand, since there was about 5 of us tripping practically every few days.  However one guy in our dormroom - we'll call him S - had never done LSD before coming to college, and after having a wacky but silent freakout on 1 of the doses we had given him a few weeks prior - he decides to go ahead and take 4 (against all of our admonitions, of course).So my roomies and I are sitting around the pad, chillin, watchin the tube, cooking, etc. etc.  When all of a sudden S stumbles out into the room and starts looking around at everybody in a strange and lolling way, moving around to people and pawing at them slowly.  I was the furthest from him, in a chair by the wall, trying to pay attention to some movie.  But people on the couch started making exclamations like 'hey!'  and 'what the fuck, dude!' and 'yo! get off me!' and jumping up to walk away.  All of their migrations left S right in front of me, who smiled strangely and starting moving in as if to kiss me!  Pause for a second here - because this was a MENS dorm, and everyone in the room was clearly heterosexual (except for maybe a different guy, who was out with some chicks that night) - so I knew that S was not gay, and even if he was, I was CERTAINLY not having any of it.  So I got up from the chair snarling like an animal ready for blood, thinking that some show of primality might make it into his dazed brain... which it did, after a few moments.  He slumped to the floor, amidst incredulous glares and continual 'what the fuck?!'s from all of us.  At which point he pulled down his pants and began to wank - right there on the living room floor.  Most of us were laughing our asses off in disgust, but someone managed to say 'you sick bastard! go to your room to do that shit! nasty!' etc. etc.S manages to realize he shouldnt be doing that, pulls up his pants and starts wandering into the back of the dormroom, mumbling things like 'I'll never get laid' and 'no one wants me' and 'Im not shit' etc. etc.  At this point, I was beginning to see the gathering clouds of a full on freak out, and started following him around, trying to talk him down.  I quickly saw that he would have none of it - repeating his mantras of 'I am nothing' 'NOTHING!!!!' and growing to heights of great emotional strain during each looping display.  -------Intermission-------Wouldnt it be a classic fate that the loudest, most drug addled room in the entire dorm building... was right next door to the faculty RA supervisor??  That would be a laugh, right!  Kind of a bummer too, sometimes!  Right?---------------------------------So at this point, having reduced everything to screams of 'NOTHING!!', S began to paw and beat at himself.  I was becoming worried for the entire room, since S was screaming very loudly and our building's RA was just next door.  (all of us had extensive amounts of contraband scattered in various 'hiding places')  Being that he didnt appear to be in physical pain or distress, I decided to lock him in his room.   I put on a Doors album (his favorite music, or so he said) at loud volume.  I turned off the lights.  For about 10 minutes, it seemed to work.  Then, as all of us were chillin again in the main room, we started to hear S screaming at the absolute top of his lungs - continuously until he seemed out of breath - and then repeating, over and over and over.  We all realized that this was definately no good, and some were ready to turn him over to the building supervisor right then.  Instead, me and another guy decided to take another shot at calming him down.  We walked into his room and were greeted by him standing there in (somehow?) classic psychotic pose, trembling and playing with his lips in a very disturbing and schizoid type of way.  He was still screaming at the top of his lungs, but looking into his eyes I swear it almost seemed like he was enjoying his little roll in the mud.  My roomie took a few steps towards him saying 'dude... are you okay??'  But just as he got over to him, S opened his mouth and sort of projectile puked onto my roomies shoe.  It was a strange scene... as he stopped trembling or moving at all... then made a short 'BLECH!'... and then went right back into his schizoid spasms.  My roomie turned and walked out without another word - obviously completely fed up with S.  At this point, with S continuing to scream as loud as humanly possible, the prospect of turning him over to the building supervisor in a pre-emptive strike seemed very appealing to most if not all of us in the dorm room. After a short ordeal in which my roomies and I tried to act innocent amidst this horrible, satanic psychedelic overdose - the RA called the paramedics.  They had to get the cops to help them drag S out of our room - still mumbling and playing with his lips, screaming and the whole nine yards.The next day, after coming back from my classes, I saw S at home, sitting in the chair.  He was clearly pissed off, and clearly sober.  He complained in his laboriously sinister humor about waking up in the hospital with a tube up his dick.  He was still sore, and also seemed to be grudging the fact that we had turned him in.  He was getting expelled from college.  But - he remembered nothing of the previous night.  He said he had blacked out early on and then refused to discuss the content of his dreamings by shrugging it off as 'stupid bullshit'.  I let one of my other roomies tell him about the gay come on scene the night before.I wanted to share this scenario becuase I have seen it come about in many different shades, this being perhaps the worst I have seen.  But the spiral into madness, toxic psychosis, and pure schizophrenic dissociation REQUIRES YOUR MIND.  The drug is only a tool, an intermediary or diplomat if you will.  Your mind is what does the tripping.  Your mind manifests the state - not the drug.  In the world of psychedelic exploration, MANY things are possible - and there are no boundaries of the experience that end in various chemical or plant designations.  When you ingest any kind of psychedelic substance, you have passport to a very powerful realm.  A realm to respected - as it is the foundation of life and death itself.  Remember this and respect this realm, and it will become your teacher and protector.  Forget this and disrespect this realm, and it could become your destroyer and purifier.  Oh, and if its your second or third time tripping: TAKE A SMALL DOSE.Exp Year: 1996ExpID: 25881Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Aug 6, 2003Views: 19,867    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Second Hand Report (42), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)I've enjoyed taking a look through some of these accounts of 'Trips' the good, bad and ugly. I wonder if anyone else who's had a bad trip and read some of the other stories here has felt a loosening of the sphincter reading other peoples nightmare episodes?! :)  The following account is an example of one very bad trip in around 30 good ones, but i'ts so far out there I thought I'd cover the bad stuff before the good. I think it's important for any would be tripper to be prepared for the fact that an experience doesn't guarantee that you'll have a good time. Its also fair to say that steps can be taken in order to have a wonderful time, the FAQ section of Erowid has a very well written 'Trip' do's and don'ts  list which I think would ensure better chances of a positive psychedelic outcome. Here's my story anyway, it's about the one that went bad.   About ten years ago I bought my third trip from a guy in my home town Norwich (UK) It was a 'Strawberry' and I was told it had been double dipped. The guy had a reputation for selling good acid so I happily gave him my cash. My being in Norwich was just a social visit over a couple of days and catching up with friends. On the last day there I decided to drop the tab and use my friends house as 'Trip HQ' He knew what I was up to, he had gone to work and left me his keys to make myself at home. I took the single LSD tab in the late morning in a positive state of mind with no worries or anxieties. I began to come up on the acid towards the lunch time. It was to be the first and last time I'd ever trip alone. Outside it was a glorious sunny day but I was happy enough in my temporary sanctuary to even think about going outside. The LSD rush started blazing up my spine and racing through my guts, I felt a little uneasy with it but had enough mind to allow myself to just go with it and wait until the rush plateaued.It did just that a little later, I'd decided to sit in the upstairs of the house and listen to music on the radio in a sunlit bedroom. I was having a wonderful time, watching floral Escher type patterns breathing over my skin, I enjoyed looking in the mirror looking at my grinning face with very distinct map contour patterns gently washing over my flesh. Its seemed like a great start eh?  Well, I vaguely recall deciding to go downstairs again for some reason then the next thing I recall was awakening on the floor of the dining room alone. The first thing I noticed was that there were blowflies buzzing around a bowl of catfood on the kitchen floor (Which was in view) I remember feeling perplexed as to why both flies had two bright neon after images in red and blue. I sat up and tried to figure out why I was on the floor in the first place. Now its worth pointing out before I take you down my helter skelter that somehow because of my black out, I'd completely forgotten that I'd taken anything at all. Prior to tripping I'd also written myself a note of reassurance in case things got too weird. So, sitting up on the floor still, I found my note and tried to read it. Alas because I was acid addled the words made no sense to me. Instead they morphed like alien glyphs and danced around on the piece of paper. It was then that my last little link to sanity crumbled and I heard my voice utter the terrifying words 'I've gone mad!' I had a feeling that I had to be somewhere else which then got heightened by the digital watch I was wearing suddenly bleeping a time alarm at me. but I had no idea why or what it meant.  So I left my sanctuary, I later found out that I left the back door wide open thus making the house entirely a burglars free for all. (Fortunately without that as a repercussion) I remember walking almost on auto pilot down a busy street heading towards town, I saw one of my old school teachers who also saw me, but the only thing I did was force a grin and keep on walking. I did indeed walk, not so much as a conscious effort or with any sense of intent, I felt utterly out of control, I collided with someone carrying their shopping -- vaguely heard them cuss at me as I continued in my stride, I turned down a passageway between two houses and strolled though the backdoor of a house I'd once lived in, past the new inhabitant and out the front door. I walked into the city center from there -- I still don't know how I survived crossing roads but I did. I strolled into a city cafe where my friend's son was working, he saw me and said hello, but in my acid addled state of autopilot I just walked past him into the main cafe and sat down, then I stood up and walked out of the cafe without uttering a word.  Other than being completely out to lunch on LSD at that time in the trip, I don't recall hallucinating, moreover I was more a puppet on a string guided by some subconscious walking mechanism which had its own design on where I should be, there was certainly no cognitive thinking to my actions. After the brief cafe episode of the trip, the situation just went from bad to worse.  Somehow I'd navigated myself through Norwich during the busy lunchtime shoppers and begun to head in the direction of the city's central park 'Chapelfield gardens' As a child I'd always felt a sense of friendliness and comfort there. Now in my fried state the familiar comfort of this park had shifted to its polar opposite, I was now hallucinating on top of everything else. The people in the park were all walking around but my perception had begun to distort their heads and faces beyond any form of human recognition. If you could imagine for a moment being surrounded by people in a busy place where their heads had been removed and replaced by Squids and Octopus you might begin to accurately picture the scene confronting me in the park. Everyone had tentacles smothering their faces and dangling down their necks like fleshy snake beards, even the women and children were not exempt from this disfiguration. The octopoid heads were white in appearance and each person seemed to have baleful staring eyes where their ears should have been. Even in my state of auto pilot I felt nothing but sheer terror at the alien swarm of people walking around me.  My feet had obviously decided to make evasive maneuvers because I then found myself out of the park having crossed yet another treacherous main road and was now heading towards a multi storey apartment block. I recall that I got inside the building somehow and wandered in circles on one of the floors of the apartment block, I seemed stuck in a loop of wanting to get out, walking around a circle of short corridors and arriving at a janitors cupboard, I would open the door expecting to find an exit and be confronted by a dead end with cleaning products and brooms. I would repeat this several times like a fly that desperately flies in circles around a kitchen only to collide with the same window again and again. I don't remember how I finally broke the loop but I did. The next thing that happened was the memory of walking around some side streets, into someones back garden via an alley way, I recall a middle aged woman looking a little afraid of me being in her yard and rushing into her house closing the door behind her. I left the yard and I think I walked between two garages, the gap between them was tight, perhaps I tried to go through it anyway, In my mind I was a being trapped inside an ever tightening spiral that I relentlessly marched along. As the spiral tightened my body would begin to crush, if I were to continue down the spiral I would surely be crushed to my final atom. . .  I must have snapped out of that little loop of fractal thought mental torture, I was now adjacent to a main road in Norwich called 'Unthank road'. I was in a front garden of another house, the inside of my mouth felt like plant matter, when I tried to scream, my tongue shot out as a mix of flesh and thorny rose stem. The situation was utterly hopeless, and getting ever worse with each lysergic eternal minute. Over the other side of Unthank road from where I stood was a dental repair workshop, a discreet looking workplace that looked just as much part of the houses above it. I recall that I walked into this workshop to the surprise of the men who were working there, I think they said 'Hey, where do you think you're going ' etc, but I was too far gone and on my way out again still under the guidance of this momentum and hidden agenda of the auto pilot within me.  The adjacent side street began the final demise of my terrifying trip, you'll have to indulge me in this part and go with the flow of reality and abstract woven together. First off, like a lemming I walked across this side road, onto the pavement then promptly plummeted a good seven ft into someones basement flat, there had probably been a flight of steps leading down to this concrete pit but I didn't see them and wouldn't have known what to do with them if I had. I guess I clambered up to street level again and limped my way up this street which was a bit of a cul de sac. Part of my subconscious memory must have recalled that an ex girlfriend had lived at the end of the street. I found myself walking up to her old front door which was one of those aluminium framed, double glazed types. I recall my reflection looking somewhat like a Francis Bacon painting, a mixture of anguished flesh and black oils ripping like blood down my body.  I was falling in eternal darkness, like a fleshy sack of bricks. As I fell forever I would crash through intermittent panes of glass which would shatter and tear me in my never ending descent. With the sound of breaking glass was the wavering crescendo of the word 'Mad' repeating in waves. . . mad, Mad, MAD, MAAAD,MAAAAAD,MAD,Mad,mad over and over as I plummeted, ripped and torn in darkness with splinters of glass falling beside me.  Back on the street a voice was saying'There is a way out of this, there is a word, and if it all ever gets too much you just say '_____________' and a door will open to allow you away from here'  Back on the street I had staggered a few more paces then fallen. I was now a seven year old child lying on the pavement, my best friends parents stood over me feeling concerned 'What happened', 'He's hit his head', 'Call an ambulance'. A disk-shaped hole appeared above me with someones arm reaching down to me to try and pull me up into safety, I tried to reach the grasping hand but couldn’t, then the hole disappeared. I was staggering along the street again at the bottom of the cul-de-sac. My gaze lifted to the sky and the sky's gaze fell upon me, each cloud was now a giant type of amoeba type organism, covered in dots which pulsed in colour like the skin of a cuttlefish, each giant amoeba had a giant blue human looking eye observing me. I could hear voices taunting me, telling me I was stupid, telling me how thick I was for looking for the answers, telling me I had spastic consciousness. The amoebas seemed to be singing a never ending song which was something like this. . .  'I'm an umpsquamadic peel and if I ever know what I feel, then I know that I felt like this before and I always knew what I was timely for. . . ' (Repeat into infinity with a chorus of about 1000 people!)  I briefly saw existence as a giant clock face of a billion dots between each second, the dots were ticking forward in a relentless advance like the movement of a second hand. Each dot was the equivalent of someones lifetime. The internal monologue described that living and dying was part of this eternal chain, It showed me that there was a gap of nothing at the point which marked 12 on the clock face and that was a one second break from the never ending cycle of existence that any soul would have. Then the monologue started laughing at my dismay.  In reality I briefly became conscious enough to recognize that I was stumbling through a small children's play area at the base of the cul-de-sac. Its worth describing to you a little about the geography of where I was. Adjacent to the cul-de-sac is a small path which leads to about four flights of stone steps leading to a street below. This street is called 'Park lane'. If you go through the gap in the fence at the back of the childrens play area there is a steep foliage ridden embankment that leads down to a flint gravel parking area at the rear of a Park lane hotel. Guess which route I took!  In reality I passed through the gap in the fence, failed to notice the dangerous drop below me then tumbled down the embankment onto the flint parking area. I was crawling on my hands and knees by this point. A piece of flint had torn the palm of my hand making it look like a stigmata wound which was pretty appropriate to the following delusion. . .  I was in a place that looked like 'The sea of holes' from the Beatles 'Yellow submarine' movie. This was a white void with an infinity of swarming black dots, I could hear air raid sirens and the sound of buzzing, In the sea of holes was a giant cross which had a festering bloody pile of guts and organs spread across it staining the wood crimson. The guts were smothered in wasps stinging the ruined flesh causing venomous pustules. It was an image of impossible pain then the monologue returned booming over the sirens and drone of the wasps 'This is Christ, he's still suffering for your sins, still paying the price. . . ' More laughter, then a fleeting moment of reality. I had crawled across Park lane and collapsed in the gutter on the other side of the road, my jacket was gone, there were cuts and grazes over my bare arms. A wasp had landed by my elbow and was making a snack for itself on one of my cuts, I remember trying to brush it away and it stinging me as I did. Over the other side of the street I saw a woman pushing a pram and looking at me with concern but now I had returned to acid Hell again. My body was a giant mass of green flesh punctured all over by cactus-like thorns that had grown from within and broken my skin on the way out. I had no arms or legs, I was more like a mass of tendrils with an apple shaped mass at the top. My form was that of pain, nothing more and nothing less.  A brief flash of a police car pulling up beside me, someone getting out. . .  I was pain, floating in the sea of holes, there were a billion holes, each one a passage leading to another identical ocean of swarming black dots. The monologue told me there was only one hole which lead away from here. . .  I was in a hospital, lying on a padded vinyl mattress with medics standing around me, I was human-shape again. The doors of the room I was in swung open to reveal an idyllic country side scene of green hilly pastures, bathed in glorious sunlight and a friendly looking old Oak tree in the foreground view, if only I could crawl through those doors I would be safe, my soul saved. But I couldn't move, the doors swung shut then opened again, now I could see a hospital corridor instead of the fields, someone was being pushed past on a stretcher trolley.  Back in the sea of holes it seemed that my gaze in any direction would erase the back dots in their masses, for the first time in this nightmare trip I felt a sense of conscious hope. I began to wipe swathes of dots by sweeping glances into the void around me. . .  'What have you taken?'  I was gaining hope by the minute, stripping the black dots away, removing these taunting false exits. . .  'What have you taken? Was it acid?'  Surrounded by a self-created white void of comfort I gazed at the final bunch of black dots and knew my release from Hell was merely held by these remaining few. . .  'He's out of it still'  I had gazed all but two of the black dots away, these two now had a bridge akin to a line seen in a dot to dot puzzle, in my mind my voice returned as I stared at each dot, I heard my own internal voice yelling 'One Two, One, Two, One one, Two. . . ' Then The two dots looked like my own hands with cuffs around them. The black line bridge had become a visible chain, the white void had faded to become a hospital room. I was in fact on my back on a hospital bed with my arms trapped beneath me, I was looking through my legs at my wrists grazed with the rubbing pressure of police hand cuffs around them, then I yelled 'Get these fucking hand cuffs off me!'  In the room with me were a male and female police officer from the Norfolk constabulary, they had obviously been the people who had lifted me from the Park lane gutter and taken me to hospital. The male officer obliged my demand and removed the cuffs. The woman police officer asked me stuff like my name, If I knew where I was but the best I could muster was a brief groan. They both looked a bit frustrated and left me in the room on the hospital bed alone. I was rapidly regaining my sense of self and conscious of reality. I recalled that I had indeed dropped acid sometime earlier, my Hospital surroundings and the amount of cuts and bruises I had were confirmation to me that whatever I'd done, it had seriously backfired big time!  I sat on the edge of the hospital bed, noted a number of missing items I had recalled having on my person prior to all of this. I found my pumps in the bedside cabinet and put them on. Then I took my first deliberate steps across the room I was in. The bizarre nature of this entire episode had one final twist installed for me. I recall walking to the door of my single bed room and opening it, a few feet away from me were the two police officers facing each other having an intense conversation about what to do about me. They were so engrossed in their discussion that neither noticed as I came out of the room and begun walking down the hospital corridor. There was a window that stood from floor to ceiling, the type that pivots in the central vertical axis, so judging that I could fit through the gap, I squeezed through it!  There is little left to tell of this story, except to say my walk from the hospital to the train station was quite distressing, I was in a lot of pain. Had stitches in my chin, my elbow and hand. My right forearm had swollen up purple making it look like Popeye's right hook. I was still semi hallucinating but very aware of how I'd nearly died and how I had a lot of explaining to do when I got home to my girlfriend. There were no legal repercussions for giving the police the slip, I had caught a train back home to a village in Suffolk which was not in the jurisdiction of the Norfolk constabulary, however they had contacted my father who was in Norfolk, so I had quite a bit of explaining to do for him too!  In retrospect, it was the worst day of my entire life, It was the closest I can imagine to having full blown psychosis. I think it was nothing short of a miracle that I didn't end up over someones car bonnet or worse. Do I believe the monologues and symbols of that day? I'm not entirely sure I do, I now understand that intense adrenalin bursts whilst hallucinating are responsible for dragging the mind into the abyss of fear and worst possible scenarios. I kind of feel that I would have a very bleak outlook for life and reality if I believed for a moment that anything I saw in that trip was true. I've had some other trips which were glorious and the polar opposite of that day. So I tend to agree with Aldous Huxley that Heaven and Hell are both valid states of consciousness, It all depends on where the person is at and how we navigate through the psychedelic state which determines which destination we arrive at. If anything puzzles me at all about that day, it would have to be the black-out I experienced early in the trip, I suspect that had I not lost consciousness I would probably have not forgotten that I took the drug and therefore wouldn't have panicked myself into an internal Hell fractal.Exp Year: 1992ExpID: 15901Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 5, 2003Views: 94,728    LSD (2) : Hospital (36), Bad Trips (6), General (1) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(pill / tablet)BODY WEIGHT:150 lbIt was my 18th birthday, I was not planning on tripping or doing anything besides smoking a few buds and going to my kegger. My friends had set up a party for me about a half an hour from the town we live in, in a very small town I had hardly ever been to, in a house I had never been to. We were just getting ready to roll on out when I decided to stop by one of my friends houses to make sure she was still coming to my party and see if she needed a ride. when I walked in her house she was just hanging up the phone and she turned to me and said 'guess what birthday boy, some dose just rolled into town!' Well I had thought acid was my all time favorite drug, I had tripped about eight of nine times before and thought I had this tripping thing down, I was wrong.Let me tell you something really fast, in my town, 5000 people 60 miles away from any other 'populated' town, you get a pretty good idea of anything that comes around, what I mean by that is the speed, coke, weed, and acid are almost always the same quality as the last time give or take a little bit. The acid that came to town went like this: 1 hit= body high, 2 hits= mild trip, 3 hits= heavy trip and  4 hits= not fun anymore. This is how it had been for years, this is the way it is now. But on that fateful day, the exception that proved the rule came into play.I went to the dealer's house and he knew me pretty good, everyone knows everyone in a town of 5000. He had heard it was my birthday so he dumped out about 30 or 40 dark brown geltabs sifted threw them and pulled out one of the biggest in the group for a birthday hit. I thanked him and started to leave then thought, I didnt want to do this by myself so I bought two more to share with a few choice friends. I gave one hit to the girl that told me it was in town, now let me tell you now, she would always write me poems and shit about how much fun we had tripping together and how we were tripping partners and shit, the other I gave to me best friend that was a real straight shooter, smoked pot a few times, but never really got into the drug scene. He was one of those guys that everyone would see us and wonder how someone that was such a straight guy could be best bros with such a druggie. Well me and my buddy took our hits about 15 minutes before we left town and I gave the other hit to the girl when we were leaving.Most acid usually takes about 45 minutes to start getting the 'acid jitters' then I'm tripping an hour after dosing. We got the jitters and the 'seeing the glue behind the wall paper' type feelings when we were leaving, 15 minutes after dosing, thatÆs when I knew something was wrong, after all, we only took 1 hit. By the time we were pulling into the town of my party, 45 minutes after dosing, my friend kept saying there was no roof on the car. Sure enough I looked up and I saw the roof ripping away molocule by molocule, I could see the stars outside and feel and hear the wind blowing like crazy, I looked over to my side and the entire side of the car ripped away in the same way as the roof, I could ACTUALLY SEE the plants alongside the road and the pavement we were driving over! Keep in mind this is when most acid would normally just be taking effect.Well we got to the party and all my friends were there, I walked in and looked at one of my buddyÆs sitting on a chair with ty-dyed flowers sprouting out of the walls and chair he was sitting on, then I looked at him and his face morphed onto an evil looking frog. By now things were getting insane. I tried to calm myself and sit down for awhile, thatÆs when I looked into the kitchen and saw a very cool tile pattern layed into the floor. Now this was a real pattern, it was all kinds of squares, rectangles, triangles, octagons, of all different color. I was looking at this when I noticed my heartbeat, then I saw that with every beat, a wave went out from my body and hit this pattern and blew all the little tiles up into the air, flipping all over the place, then falling back into position, this went along the intire length of the pattern, in one wave after another. That was the last good feeling I felt for almost 4 months. Now here is where my story will stop going in a line and just go from one weird thing to another, sorry for this, but I had thousands of thoughts ripping through my mind at the same time and I cannot tell you exactly what all happened in the right order.I remember looking into a part of the house that was not completely finished it had plywood against the walls, ceiling and floor. I made the mistake of stumbling into this room... I thought I was in a stall of some sort, I found the door and escaped but it was to late, the stall was already in my mind, buried for the moment, but soon to come rising up with a horrible vengance. I went and sat on the couch, and thatÆs when I started noticing that my friends kept doing the same thing over and over again. I mean they kept doing the SAME thing! I knew what they would do before they did it. And I started to become convinced that they were all trying to brainwash me except my buddy who dosed with me... Wait a sec, my buddy.. he's in trouble! I knew this, I had forgot all about him since we got to the house, then I went on a frantic hunt to find him. Find him I did, the guy I was responsible for, I gave him the drugs, he never tried anything like this before. He was curled up in the corner of a dark, dirty room with no furniture in it, he had his coat hood pulled up around his head and he was just layeing there in the fetal position, shaking and crying like a child. I went to find the girl I had givein the dose to, and she did the worse thing she could ever do to a person. She looked me right in the eye and said 'I'm not tripping, I dont know why' this was when I was trying to gain a little sanity and my buddy was reliving some childhood trauma, and this girl was saying the acid wasnÆt any good. Turns out she had just got a new jealous boyfriend that she didnÆt want to do drugs without so she hadnÆt taken the hit and had saved it for him. I hate her. I lost my friend again and went into the trip deeper than I ever thought possible. I remember seeing a sentance floating in the air in front of me, I would read it but the end of the sentance was just the begining again, but I couldnt catch on, I just kept reading it faster and faster until it was a whirl of white letters in the air that sucked my mind into a very very very scary trip. I thought that I was stuck in a joke, the joke had 4 parts to it but the end was just the start again, and I relived the joke hundreds of times, just barely catching it at the start, but not knowing if me catching it was part of the cycle. I felt like it was some sort of sick sitcom for a higher being, that I had no control over, and I was never suppose to find out about.Now this got to a point where my mind could no longer stand the pure terror I was going threw, all of a sudden my mind was sucked out of the joke and I could watch it from a distance. It was total blackness except for something that looked like one of those 'shoe box managers' or little set ups you had to build in grade school, but each side of the box had a different part of the joke in it. I watched this for a few minutes until I lost all idea of where I was, it was like I fell out of the joke and stayed there, outside, watching it for a few minutes, then I fell. ģWhen I snapped out of it I was in a huge line of people in a whirl-like pattern. Everyone was walking towards the center of it, towards a black hole, with mindless looks on their faces; and I knew it was the souls of everyone on Earth here, shoulder to shoulder, line after line. When the people got to the center and stepped into the hole they would fall out of the hole at the end of the line and start the walk again! I remember stepping right up to the hole, then getting a notion of what was happening and freaking out! I pushed my way through about 5 of these mindless people before the ōsystemö got me again and I had to resume walking with no choice; but I was out of place in line, and in return, I knew I had lost my place in life.This is the worst part of it all. Do you remember when I was talking about the stall? Well I was still completely gone from reality and I saw myself turn into a cartoon. I watched cartoon trees grow up out of nowhere in a very dark carton forest. I knew something was in the darkness and soon I found out what.. the trees grew up one after another until they formed a wall the same color of the plywood, the same color as the stall, then the stall turned into a maze and I know this sounds so fucked up but it is the gods honest truth, I felt myself turning into a deer, I felt hair growing out of my face and my face growing longer, then I could feel my mind reverting back into some VERY primal state. Now as if being a little baby deer in a maze wasnt bad enough, I knew there was something in there with me, hunting me. Soon it found me, it was a GIANT cartoon buck, but it had human eyes and looked more like one of those christmas animation shows they use to show on FOX in the late eightys. (stop laughing, it was fucking scary) To tell you the truth, I dont know how I got out of that. Finally I pulled myself together, only because I knew my friend needed help, if I hadnt been there for him, I dont know if I would have ever got out of that trip. I managed to find him after we started coming down, but we were still REALLY fucking high, we walked outside and both said we had to get out of this house, both of us could feel a VERY evil presence in the center core  of that old home. My friend looked up at a tree and pointed to it noshalantly and said, hey, it's spinning.  I looked up and the tree turned into like dandyline branches spinning like there was no tommorow.  I found out that the acid I took made many other people go crazy, the guys that had the stuff destroyed a house they were at and flushed all there shit down the toilet.  I also found out that the 'one hit' I took turned out to be more like 15 hits.  Well I'm about tired of writing this now so I will try to sum it up.I couldnt smoke pot anymore because every time I did I got sucked back into this trip, and this was a MAJOR lifestyle change because smoke pot was all I did for about 6 years.After this trip I was really going crazy, I had to quit my job because I was convinced there was someone behind the wall watching everything I did, just to make sure I didnt let on to their secret, finally after about 4 months of getting worse and worse, I pulled together four of my best friends and asked for there help, we went and bought some really pure LSD went to a place we all knew and felt good at, and we reprogrammed my mind, this was with my buddy that I got into that situation. Things werenÆt better the next day but instead of slowly getting worse every day, they started getting better every day. Exactly one year to the day of that trip I woke up in my bed in a cold sweat and everything was flashing brown and black, then I layed back and I could feel something draining out of me, I smiled to myself and said out loud, it's over, then fell right back to sleep. I have had a few bad things since then but only when I beg for them, like getting spun out for 3 days then drinking and smoking dope, even then it is just very mild flachbacks that I can control.So thats my story, I hope someone learns something from it.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 18029Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 5, 2003Views: 8,572    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Bad Trips (6), Post Trip Problems (8), General (1) DOSE:30 mgoralAmphetamines(pill / tablet) 15 mgoral5-MeO-AMT  1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:215 lbThis story may be long, but it’s based on the night that I OD’d and nearly died so please read it full through before you throw it away or discard it.  A lot of this is from the things that have started to come back to me, because for some of this story I was unconscious or unresponsive.  I have had to learn what the whole story is because there are parts where I am hallucinating and cannot remember, but they are mostly at the end of my trip.It was Friday and the last day of class for the semester.  I got up at 9am for my 10am.  Took my 30mg of Adderall for ADD and started walking to class, it would only take me ten minutes to get to class, but I wanted to take my time and enjoy the walk.  I went to my classes and was done by 12am.  I ate some lunch with whoever was around, because everything’s usually dead on the weekends.  I hung out playing video games in my friend's room waiting for people to arrive so that we could go to where we were staying the night.  It would be a great night; there would be drinking, tripping, smoking, and a blizzard outside.  We knew we were going to be having fun and enjoying ourselves in a warm house.  We wouldn't be able to leave for a while because people were busy doing stuff and there were all sorts of complications with where the alcohol was and who wanted to go stay the night.  We finally got to the house and waited for the alcohol to arrive along with my fellow trippers.  It was getting bad outside and we were getting worried about our friends being out in a blizzard.  It was around 10 or 11 when they finally arrived with the alcohol, 5 MEO AMT, and themselves.  I was waiting for the trippers to get there so I could pop my pill and take my tab of LSD.  Against the better advice of the friend who sold me the LSD [1 tab] and the 5 MEO AMT [10-20mg], I took them both at the same time.  I had taken 5 MEO AMT several times before; so I was well aware of the effects that it would have on my stomach and that I would either throw up or wish I had thrown up.  I waited for the nausea to kick in and it did and I felt really horrible.  My friend told me to wait at least two hours for the LSD to kick in before I take the 5 MEO AMT.  He told me that it was old and may not be very potent; plus I didn’t keep it well refrigerated so I figured it probably wouldn’t even work.  Once I had started to throw up a little that’s when I noticed I had begun to trip.  Everyone knew that I was taking LSD and 5 MEO AMT at the same time, so they were watching me carefully to make sure I was okay.  They would follow me outside when I needed to throw up just in case I walked off into the nearby ocean or thought lying down in the snow would be a great idea.  The snow next to where I was throwing up started to move and shift in shape.  It was different shades of white and grey moving around together in snake like patterns.  The wind was blowing and I heard ominous voices that were not really there.  I went inside and one of my friends tried to mess with me and immediately I flipped out and acted hostile towards him, by telling him not to do that because he knows full well the negative effects of messing with someone who is tripping.  I quickly reclaimed my composure and assured everyone that I was not violent.  Everyone there agreed that it’s not good to mess with one of the tripping kids; especially the one on Acid.  I sat down in my friend’s room while Weezer was being played on the computer.  I looked at the War Craft 3 poster in front of me, the characters were really fighting, and I could hear them fighting.  I turned around to discover a friend sitting on the bed behind me playing with her boyfriend’s cat all while listening to the music and having a good time.  She was talking to the cat; very possibly about me I am not really sure.  But their presence in the room made me feel a sense of warmth, love, and connection that I could not describe.  These feeling were overwhelming with the sounds of Weezer and battle which were coming from the direction of the computer.  I left the room and sat by the door between the kitchen and living room, while there I started feeling like people were verbally attacking me and I would respond with “Fuck you _________!!!!, but not fuck you ________” and this would go on for a little while, I would be in and out of conversations without even being in the conversations or even saying anything that made sense.  I was tense about the fact that people were planning to leave, because there were still people who had not arrived yet.  So I ran out the door yelling “NO, no, no, no, no!!!! No one is going anywhere!!!!!”  I knew I was tripping nuts, but I was still cognitive or so I thought I was to take control of the situation and prevent anyone from leaving.  They wondered who had just run outside yelling and checked who left.  Whoever went out to check came back and I told them that it was me who went out.  They told me that no one was going to pick anyone else up, because everyone was already there.  Friends of mine from back home started to show up, but I knew that they were back home and not really there, but I was talking with them and conversing with them as if they really were there.  I began to answer a question that no one had asked me and try to get them to understand that I was tripping and was not capable of answering their question.  I tried to explain to them that I understand Tool and Maynard.  I told them if they looked hard enough eventually they would see what I was seeing and that their time would come.  This is around the point where things started getting bad and my trip comes to an end.  I moved to a place on the floor in the kitchen and as I looked around I could see the music moving around me, it was as if I could see the energy and waves pulsing, flowing, and swirling all around the room.  I was beautiful, I felt as if I had never truly experienced music before.  I started asking them to play some darkness (turn off the lights) and play some Tool.  I kept asking for darkness, but then when they started to reach for the light I quickly told them not to turn off that light, I was confused and didn’t know what was going on.  They didn’t turn off the light, I don’t know if I was afraid to leap into the void or the unknown or if I was about to embark on a journey from which I would never return from or be the same again.  I held the light close to me and embraced it.  I began to see myself from the eyes of the disgusted outsider.  I am not sure what I became or how to clearly describe myself in this state, but I know that whatever it was has been locked away and is probably one of my worst fears.  I had become a little half man half creature that was puking and snotting on itself, while everyone was looking at me as if that’s what I really was at that point in time.  Then I also thought that I had gotten the cops called and that they were on their way to arrest me for public drunkenness or lewd conduct, and my friends were just looking at me and saying “Yeah that’s our friend Hans, the one who gets drunk and gets the parties broken up.”  While others were saying “That’s the reason you don’t do a lot of drugs.”  I didn’t know what to believe.  I started asking for “darkness, play some darkness, just kill me now, just shoot me, put a bullet in my head, darkness, darkness, just kill me now, just shoot me, put a bullet in my head.”  I then lay down and gave up and said one last thing to the paramedic and police officer who suddenly appeared out of no where “Fuck it I give up, yeah I’m the one you are looking for I’m the dying kid.”  Then I blacked out.While I had been seeing my friends from home, the creature in the corner, and the paramedic reaching out to me; I was non-responsive.  My friends have seen bad trips before and knew some techniques on how to help a friend get through a bad trip, but I started having seizures and they immediately called the 911 for help.  I had fifteen seizures on the way to the hospital, I was in a coma for a two days.  My parents had to drive an hour and a half through a blizzard the next day at 8:30 the next morning, while under the assumption that their son was dead or dying in the hospital and that I may not be alive by the time they got there.  My friends watched me nearly die on their kitchen floor, gave statements at the police station, stayed with me in the hospital until my parents arrived, waited around to hear if there had been any change in my condition, deal with my parents when they arrived (who were not happy with the situation, but happy that they did the right thing when it mattered the most), as well as visit me in the hospital.  I hope they can all forgive me for my selfishness and know how much I appreciate what they did for me.  I hope they know how much they mean to me and that I love them for the good people they are.  If someone asked me what made me a rich man, I would have to tell them “the friends that I have make me the richest man in the world.”  The police told my friends that they may be held on manslaughter charges because I may not make it through the night.  This night has taught me a lot of things never mix hallucinogens with Adderall, don’t trip alone, be aware of the negative aspects of hallucinogens and other drugs. I am lucky to be alive, but the only reason is because of great friends who acted quickly and called for help when they were the situation was out of their control.Hallucinogens can be fun, but can also be very dangerous as well.  You never know what can interact negatively with your normal medications.  If you are going to mix anything just remember that you may cause yourself to end up having seizures, coma, brain damage, or death.  It’s also not fair to let the people who care about you in life watch, you make that mistake.  I am lucky to be alive and able to speak without brain damage. Erowid Note: A friend of the author's wrote to Erowid with the following in Aug 2004: I recently received the news about the research chemical websites that were shut down by the DEA.  It is horribly unfortunate.  However, I found some discrepancies in the news reported by the DEA.  Example:'In December 2003, police responded to a call of a college student found unconscious, unresponsive and turning blue on the kitchen floor of a residence in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. He had been lying on the floor for 45 minutes before a call for help was made. This student was suffering from the ingestion of a substance he obtained from WWW.RACRESEARCH.COM. This overdose victim now suffers from chronic, violent seizures.'I knew that person.  He was a student of Umass Dartmouth (state school).  Some facts:He had mixed LSD with 5-MeO-AMT. Also, he was on an Adderall prescription.  The combination of these three drugs led to his overdose.  Furthermore, he was not simply lying helpless on the floor for 45 minutes.  His friends had been attending to him trying to help him, without drawing official attention.  The student was in a two day coma afterwards, but does not suffer from 'chronic, violent seizures' now at all.I have not been threatened with prosecution or anything by the DEA about these sites, but I was under investigation locally (though not charged -- I was expelled).  I just think that it really, really, really sucks about these sites going under, and the DEA has to exaggerate to make it sound worse than it was.  I hope some of the information I provide here is helpful. August 15 2004:The DEA removed the mention of this overdose from their July press release in mid August, 2004.  The person involved called several times to complain to the DEA that they had misrepresented the story about him.Exp Year: 2003ExpID: 29591Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 20, 2004Views: 38,580    5-MeO-AMT (104), LSD (2) : Hospital (36), Overdose (29), Health Problems (27), Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3) DOSE: T+ 0:003.5 goralMushrooms   T+ 1:004 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:157 lbThe night started off as any other Saturday nite.  I had purchased a half ounce of some nice buds earlier in the day, and planned on smoking all nite, and eventually eating some shrooms.  This is usually what I do on saturdays.  But this Saturday turned out to be a lot different.  I went to a friend's house at about eight o'clock, and started smoking.  After a couple blunts, my friend asked if i wanted to drink that night.  I decided to get drunk, so we started drinking shots of Jack Daniels.  I had about 10 or 12 shots, and was pretty drunk.I decided to eat my shrooms around 9 or 9:30, and then continued drinking and smoking.  Around 10, another friend showed up, and announced that he had bought a couple of strips of acid.  I had never done acid before, and wanted to try it, so i payed him for 4 tabs.  But because i was extremely shitfaced, i decided to take all 4 tabs that nite.   About 30 minutes later, i was starting to trip, but then I realized that this was not the acid, it was the shrooms.  When I started tripping real hard, I remember hoping that the acid would not kick in, that it would be fake.  If only it were fake.  I lost track of time completely.  I was already seeing trails, and swirling designs, but i started to have strange thoughts, and these designs would become faces.  My friend's faces started to seem more and more scary.  I remember thinking over and over that the police were watching me, and I would go to jail as soon as I stepped foot out of the house.  I expressed these thoughts to both friends, and all they did was laugh.  This upset me so bad, that I started to feel as if they were against me too.I started to feel isolated and alone, and all of a sudden it seemed that random objects were staring at me.  These included the stereo, and a chair.  I started to drool and my nose was running.  I wanted to get up and go to the bathroom but I was afraid to leave the room.  So, like an idiot, I pissed my pants.  This was soon followed by shit.  When I told my friends what I had done, they started laughing harder and harder, until finally I could not take it any more.  I ran out of the house, and down the street.There was an elderly woman walking down the street, so I asked her how to get to my house, expecting she would know.  She gave me a confused look, and I thought she could possibly be an undercover cop, so I put her in a headlock, and threw her to the ground.  I then kicked her in the ribs a couple times, and ran like hell.  When I realized the horrible thing I had done, I started to really lose it.  I mean REALLY lose it.  I blacked out, and the next thing you know, I had choked a cat in an alley, and was having sex with it.  I dont know why I was doing it, but i was.  It wasnt even fun.This is when the police showed up, and I did not know what to do.  When they asked me what I was doing with the cat, I said 'this' and smashed its head into a wall.  I then charged at the police, who beat me with billy clubs.  I am now doing six months for animal cruelty, marijuana possession, drunk and disorderly, assault, and resisting arrest.Exp Year: 2003ExpID: 24051Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 20, 2004Views: 3,856    Mushrooms (39), LSD (2) : Various (28), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:3 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:135 lbI had tripped many times on LSD and had had the absolute most best experiences of my life. Then one time I took an unexpectedly strong dose and got a little too fucked up. After one bad trip I could never trip the same since.My usual dose of acid was always just one or two hits of blotter if it was of decent potency. One new years eve though, some new acid came along and I had no idea how strong it was. I took three which was too much for me because it ended up being the most potent acid ever witnessed in the area. I took the acid and went out to get a few people to go to this house party for new years. What I first noticed was how incredibly quick it started to hit me. I started getting comments on my huge pupils and what not and thought to myself, 'what the fuck? Didn't I only take this shit like 10 minutes ago?' Anyways I was feeling wacked like 15-20 mins in. The realization that I took a little too much for my own good started to set in by the time I got to the party. It was only like an hour or so into it that I felt more messed up than I have ever felt before. The party turned out to be a bad spot. A lot of assholes were there. Most of the acceptable people didn't show up. And to make matters worse the assholes were pissy for some reason, like they couldn't get the drugs they wanted or some shit. I started to get real bad vibes from the party. I should have left but I kept trying to cope and get over it. It just got worse and worse. I started to get drilled by these really intense waves of...hard to explain. Its like an overwhelming feeling kept fucking me up in a quick succession of waves. Some idiot found out I was tripping and started making these stupid faces at me and spinning a pool stick around at me. I wanted to kill him. With that I broke out in a heavy sweat and the nausea started. It started to get pretty crazy visually and the nausea was horrible. First time to get sick like that off acid. Made me as well as others confused. They knew I was in a bad state. No one seemed to ever hear of acid nausea like that.I went in the bathroom to puke but just couldn't. Trying to barf just tripped me out. I was becoming so overwhelmed with awful feelings, fear, paranoia, betrayal(like the acid turned on me) and panic. I didn't know what to do! It was so intense! I made the mistake of telling one guy I wanted to call an ambulance to come help me, though I wasn't really going to. That would've made matters worse, I had to stick through it either way. So this idiot goes out to everybody and says 'hey guys! He's in there really fucked up, probably going to die! He says he's gonna phone the ambulance!' This caused a lot of alarm and left me to do some very unwanted explaining. Then the assholes started acting up and flicking the lights on and off and saying things like 'ha ha he's freaking out!' and one stupid bitch actually grabed me by the arm and said 'smarten up. You're not even sick, you didn't even puke. Get the fuck up and get you're act together!' I thought to myself, what the fuck is wrong with these people? They must not understand LSD. If they only knew how terrible I was inside.The visuals became a little annoying, with massive strobing going on n shit so I kept my eyes closed only to be faced with other things. The closed eye visuals were scary, the patterns forming alarming shit so I was outta luck either way. And sound was so loud and annoying! I couldn't take it! The noise was going right through me! But there was no escaping the noise. Even if I plugged my ears or went out into the more silent outdoors, this very irritating flange was coming from inside my head. Auditory hallucinations were inescapable. I could hear fucked up shit no matter what. Could see fucked up shit no matter what. My body felt so incredibly flooded with the drug. Every speck of my body felt insanely altered. Physically and mentally. People offered me some pot to smoke but it was the first time I ever turned it down because I felt way too messed up. I think I could've managed the unusually high dose (for me anyways) so much better if it weren't for that shitty, sorry excuse for a party. Maybe it would've been an awesome trip like normal.I ended up leaving the party several hours later to walk home by myself and when the fireworks went off I was lying in a snowbank a few minutes from my house coming down ever so slightly just waiting a little longer to go in because I was no state to be around parental figures.Although as I was experiencing this I wished it would end, I think it to be quite fascinating looking back at it. Unfortunately I could never trip quite like I used to ever since. After multiple attempts with acid and shrooms since then, I've had some more not so pleasant experiences (though not quite so bad as that new years) and some trips were pretty fun but I could never get that original magic back. The possibility of another bad trip always rides the back of my mind. In a way I curse that night for permanently ruining my psychedelic fun, but it was a learning experience. I gained a lot of respect for that substance and realized just how incredibly powerful it actually is. People should be very cautious with that stuff.Exp Year: 2003ExpID: 31517Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Mar 5, 2004Views: 15,157    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Large Group (10+) (19) DOSE:4 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:180 lbI had a bunch of friends who were crazy about acid, and they talked me into giving it a shot. So I popped a couple hits one night and sat back and enjoyed myself. My first expirience was awesome, and my second was amazing.Then came the third and last.I was in the same place that I had always done LSD, in my friend's very large bedroom. We bought a quarter sheet, and between four people, we ate the whole thing. I ate four hits of the stuff, as did two of my other friends, while my fourth friend, we'll call him 'Joe,' ate the remaining 13 hits. The most I had done was three, and it was mind blowing. I guess mind blowing just wasn't good enough for me though.The first couple hours were fine--extremely intense halicinations and psycological effects, but no real problems. Then things got fucked up. Joe and I both began to lose our minds. Joe was very expirienced with LSD, and had taken more than 13 hits at a time on more than a few occasions and been just fine, but this time he couldn't keep it together. We were starting to realize that we had taken some VERY powerful acid. Joe sat in a corner, rocking back and forth, sweating profusely and mumbling to himself. He became extremely confused and disoriented, and soon he was completely unaware of anything around him.I wasn't doing much better. I was losing it as well. I realized that my memory would only work for a few seconds and then I would forget anything that had just happened. This seemed to be the only thing that I could remember. I forgot my name, where I was, who I was with, what was going on, and to some extent, that I was on drugs. Though my other two friends, who were doing just fine, assured me that I was just on a hallicinogen and would be better in a few hours (which is exactly what you should remind someone on a bad trip, for all those tripsitters out there), I became convinced that something had gone terribly wrong and we we had all been turned into vegetables (not literally mind you--I wasn't THAT fucked up).As the night progressed, I felt worse and worse. I tried to get my head together, but I couldn't manage it. Then came the blackout period. I don't remember anything that happened for about the next hour of that night, all I have are a few brief flashes, none of which are very pleasant.All I remember is that Joe's mother was suddenly screaming at us to get the hell out of her house and to never come back... and I had no idea why, but I understood her and it was very real, which made it all the more scary. Next thing I can remember clearly is lying on a hospital bed with cops hovering over me. I thought the hospital walls were shaking and getting ready to collapse on me, though I kept that to myself.In that blackout period, I harassed Joe's mother and damn near assaulted her, crashed my car, fought a cop, and passed out in the middle of the street with three cops and a fireman holding me down.Fuck acid man. Sure it's a lot of fun. But just wait, all you who say it's good fun and you've never had a problem, JUST WAIT UNTIL IT TURNS ON YOU. Acid doesn't give a fuck about you, and it will show you the worst time of your life just as fast as it has showed you the best of times.Fair warning. Be safe if you are going to trip, though. Always have at LEAST one sober person present who knows how to deal with bad trips and never eat more than you think you can handle--chances are, you can't handle it.Peace, love, and positivityExp Year: 2000ExpID: 8916Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: May 13, 2004Views: 26,874    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Bad Trips (6) DOSE: T+ 0:003 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:451.5 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:235 lbI experimented with LSD once before...  I only took one hit, was completely unprepared, and with someone I didn't completely trust.  Since it was a low dosage (and I'm a pretty large guy), I didn't have a 'bad trip', but it definitely wasn't an experience I would've wanted to pay for, let alone do voluntarily.  Needless to say this led me to have a strong desire to repeat the experience but take a higher dose, be with the right people, and plan for the experience as far in advance as possible.My girlfriend and I decided to trip together this summer.  I spent about 3 weeks online and talking to friends, getting suggestions and reading experience reports to try and make it as positive an experience as possible.  We also decided to let a friend of hers trip with us, as she had a bit more experience and is a fairly level-headed person (I'd find out later how valuable an addition she really was).We had a bit of trouble getting ahold of anything, but finally I got a call last Friday and picked up a 10-strip.  The original plan was to eat about 6-8 hits between the 3 of us, and then sell the rest to my girlfriend's roommate.  We had planned to trip the next day (Saturday evening).  To make the beginning here a bit shorter, through a series of events my gf's friend came early, and we decided to trip Friday night (actually about 4am Saturday) suddenly.  Since I'd already prepared quite a bit, I figured this would be OK.When her friend (we'll call her 'M' and my gf 'E' from now on) arrived about 3:45am, we immediately broke off our initial doses.  I had decided to take 3 hits (according to the guy I bought it from, this was very strong acid) about a week previous... my girlfriend took 1 hit, and her friend took 2.  After about 30 minutes M and I started to get very 'clenchy' and nervous, as I'd expected from my readings... fortunately I'd bought a couple of pacifiers or I'd likely have gnawed through my lip at this point.  E was feeling a bit anxious, but nothing pronounced.  Just as I was starting to enter the psychedelic mindset (free flowing thoughts etc.), M starts bugging me to take more.  Note that by this time I was already starting some mild OEV's (halos, pieces of lint bouncing on the carpet etc.) and was in no condition to be making rational decisions...  I made one of the worst decisions of my life and decided to take not 1, but 1.5 more hits.  M took 1.5 more and my girlfriend too 1.My memory after this point is not only a bit fuzzy, but describing hallucinations has proven difficult, so I appologize for the spotted nature of the following:We sat back down and started listening to good trip music (Hendrix, The Doors, the Dead, etc.).  At this point everyone was seeing some really cool stuff and started peaking.  E decided she needed to be alone for a few minutes, as her visions were slightly scary, so she went back to the bedroom.  M and I went out to smoke a cigarette...  at this my vision started getting really fish-eyed, and I started to lose touch with reality a bit (not focusing on conversation/sounds etc.).  I actually began to achieve one of my goals for the trip (an out of body experience).Just as I was right where I wanted to be (my mind was freely flowing, questioning the meaning of life etc. and I felt almost completely dissociated), I heard my girlfriend scream and puke...  This had the mental effect of tying a leash around a space shuttle when it's going into orbit and telling it to stay put for a while.  Suddenly all I could think about was her, and keeping her safe.  I went to check on her and she was in bad shape... not only that but something about one of her (severe) OEV's made her scared of, and very angry with me.  At this point I started to completely lose my mind... the other hit and a half hit me like a brick wall and sent me completely out of touch with reality and life.My world became completely replaced with the world inside my head.  I'm talking about honest-to-god hallucinations here... not just visuals.  Instead of my apartment, I was inside of a Steven King-like haunted mansion with me on one and and my girlfriend screaming for my help on the other.  In reality, she was just having a hard time dealing with the intensity of it all, and M was trying to calm her down and turn her trip around.  I however, became obsessed with helping her.  At one point I remember telling her not to close her eyes or she would die... This is of course, not good for someone having a bad trip.  The state of mind I was in however, didn't allow me to see that... I was having a living dream that my girlfriend was in serious trouble and I was supposed to save her.Eventually E calmed down (and came down a bit after puking), and got to a point where she could handle everything.  I was a different story.  At one point I didn't even think I existed anymore... I questioned spirituality, love, and everything else.  Reality was completely replaced with this world inside my head (which turned from a haunted mansion into a lava lamp after I knew E was OK).  During this whole experience I touched back to reality once or twice... but the whole time my thoughts were completely on her (for the most part).When I finally returned to reality (after being gone to the point of actaully believing I was inside a lava lamp for about 4 hours) we decided to go to the gas station to get some munchies.  E and M were both fairly close to baseline... I was still having severe visual distortions (and continued to for about 8 more hours), but my mental state was relatively normal and I felt like I controlled my brain again.  On the way back someone mentioned me being out of my mind that night... I inquired more, and come to find out I was quite literally 'out of my mind' for a couple short periods of time.  Meaning I had no concept of self, no awareness or interaction, no control over myself... I acted quite literally on pure instinct.  Apparently in efforts to protect E from the harm that I made up in my head, I ended up really bugging her and actually scaring her when she asked me a question and I didn't respond (Turns out I didn't hear her at all... like I said I was 'out' of my mind for a time, kind of like temporarily checking out of a hotel).At the realization that I had caused some of her emotional distress, and that it took _3_ people to get me away from her when she was freaking out (I was 'protecting' her in my world), I walked away and burst into tears.  I suddenly realized that I had done something really stupid (taking more than my original dose) that caused her alot of mental trauma, and I was so messed up out of my mind that I couldn't even help her.We spent the next few hours talking about what had happened.  I can't really rate this as a 'negative' experience for one reason...  My girlfriend and I realize now that we were truly meant for each other.  Even when I was completely out of my mind, the only thing I could think about was protecting her...  to the point that it took 3 people to get me out of the same room with her because I thought she was in trouble (she was... just not the kind of trouble I could do anything about, all mental/emotional).  That is however, the only upside to this experience.  The moral of the story is this...  decide on a dose beforehand and stick to it, unless of course it's really just not getting you where you want to be, and even then be CAREFUL and up the dose ONE AT A TIME.  The other thing I learned, is if you prepare for something like this... stick to your preparations, don't get impatient!So that's my harrowing tale of a venture into the psychedelic, hope it helps someone avoid some similar troubles in the future.  I think I'll probably stick to MDMA from now on.  I've heard hardcore acid types say that MDMA is too 'easy', and you don't have to work for your good experience...  and guess what... they're right, X is EASY.  You pay a guy $20, swallow a pill, and have a great time almost garunteed.  All that AND you feel fine the next day...  if it's my money, X is the path to a great psychedelic experience of least possible resistance.Happy mind expanding everyone!Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 8712Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: May 13, 2004Views: 25,342    LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Relationships (44), Personal Preparation (45), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:003 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 6:001 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 7:301 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:59  oralPharms - Chlorpromazine BODY WEIGHT:140 lbToo many people have been asking me, and I'm tired of just telling people, piece by piece, the story, so I'm going to get it all out. Please understand, this is really hard for me, because it is basically a recording of my innermost thoughts, feelings, and ways of life to the core. If you don't know what I'm about to talk about, let me give you some background...On Friday, June 1st I overdosed on acid. At about 4 PM, I took three tabs (hits, or whatever you want to call them) of acid or LSD. Whatever you want to refer to it as. Later that night, I took another tab at 10 PM, and another at 11:30. That's five total. I had a life-changing experience/journey/nightmare/mind warp and here is the account:I'm not exaggerating any of this, it may sound a bit unbelievable, but that's why it had such an impact on me.At first I was just questioning reality. Which we will refer to as the 'it' for the remainder of this writing. I was thinking about the fact that I am in an endless game, or a puzzle rather. I realized it's a puzzle, because if it were solved, I wouldn't be here, in this reality, right now. And I'm stuck here at least till the day I die. Yeah, this doesn't sound like much, but I came to this SHOCKINGLY and fully understood it to the point where it was driving me insane because there really is no way to know what reality is. I experienced that. At the time, I was going off talking about it endlessly (don't forgot the drugs I was on) and then my friend Paul said, 'Yeah, if you say it's true, prove it.' I said, 'What?????' He said, 'If you're so sure that it's true, then prove it, pull the trigger.'Let me tell you, in this state of mind, that statement went straight to the bottom of my soul. It got me into a psychotic method of thinking. I started talking about it more. I realized that if I REALLY understood reality, I would cease to exist. There would be no point in my being here. I also couldn't stop thinking about the gun. I soon realized that there's nothing before the gun. (Life.) There's nothing after the gun. (Death.) And there really is no gun in the first fucking place, because I couldn't do it. I couldn't solve the puzzle. It's the big unknown, going off the deep end, and without the knowledge of what will lie behind the gun (death), I couldn't pull the trigger. It's some scary shit.The other most horrifying realization that I came to was that whether I liked it or not, this reality, this world, and everyone and everything in it is all in my head. Because there is no real way of knowing, I just kind of have to accept it. It's the whole 'Matrix' idea. Who's to say that we're not just some weird creature having a dream or some shit. Or that we're not just lying in an incubator and this reality is just our subconscious? I realized that it may or may not be all in my head. And that I may never know. So I just accept the puzzle. I accept the illusion. If I didn't want or even NEED to accept the illusion, I would just pull the trigger.Also, you have to know that at the time, I was hardcore studying Buddhism to the point where I took a vow, and all this other stuff, and I was basically a Buddhist. If you're not familiar with Buddhist or eastern philosophy in general, just know that there is a HUGE emphasis on nothingness. The fact that nothing really exists.This was something else I realized. Since everything is in my head, physical existence must be bullshit too. Therefore, physical shit ceased to matter. Everything ceased to matter. Nothing mattered. Because nothing existed at that point. All I knew was that my mind existed. Because when you take away physical possessions, even when you take away people whether they are made up by your mind or not, when you take everything away, even life, you are left only with your mind, naked and unprotected.This is basically the Buddhist concept of Enlightenment or Realization or Awakening. The full extinguishing of deluding passions and material things. So BAM, I was a Buddha. (Buddha means enlightened person.) It's not that I THOUGHT I was a Buddha, I very much WAS a Buddha. I was the happiest I have ever been in my life because I realized that nothing mattered. That nothing existed. The concept of nothingness was fully understood.But there was a problem.It didn't last. I thought about it too much and then stuff started to matter. I started caring once again about material things and a lot of other shit and it all came crumbling down. I have climbed the mountain, stood on the peak, and then fell the FUCK off of it.Shortly thereafter, I fully understood the meaning of life. I realized that the only reason human life existed was to be happy. I also realized something else. I realized that all of my (and the rest of the world's) actions and even drug use is only done to be happy. And then it came back to me. I said to myself, 'Wait. If all I really know is myself, and my mind, WHY THE FUCK AM I FUCKING IT UP WITH DRUGS???!!@#!' I realized that my mind was the most sacred and precious thing ever, because it is the only thing that I REALLY REALLY actually KNOW exists. Like I said, take away material possessions, and you end up only with your mind.One thing I have to point out is that before I came to all of these conclusions (mainly between 1 AM and 11 AM), I was walking around and seeing the negative emotions of people come out. I saw people's fear, anxiety, all that shit, and it hurt. I compare it to the story of Jesus taking on the sins of the world. I looked at everyone, strangers, friends, whoever. And FELT their sadness, or their insecurity. And I've never felt so bad in my entire life. What was even worse was because I had realized that my mind was so precious, I saw my friends later that night that had just taken some acid, and that just overwhelmed me. And to this day it overwhelms me, because I just want to tell everyone that your mind is all you know, and why fuck that up??? That's horrible.That's pretty much all the important stuff. Later on, I was actually starting to go insane (seriously) because I kept questioning reality over and over and I wasn't able to accept the illusion anymore. I was getting very psychotic and it started to get really frightening.The rest of the story is just me having an extremely hard and frightening time trying to get back into reality and eventually having to take Thorazine (a drug hospitals give to people that have overdosed on acid) to stop thinking so much and get to sleep. (I couldn't sleep even when I was trying REALLY hard.)That's pretty much it, but here's where I am now...A couple days after that, while I was still recovering, I had to accept the illusion for good, while I was sober. I had to accept that I didn't know what reality was or is, and that all I know is my mind. And that I'm alone whether I like it or not. And when I realize that, it's frightening, and bad, and extremely lonely. And I broke down and cried for three hours.So I've decided to get clean now. No more mood-altering drugs for me. I now have an amazing understanding of humanity or lack thereof, probably due to my connection with everyone's negative emotions during my experience. It still really hurts me to see everyone messing up their minds with drugs and shit. Especially my best friends. But there's nothing I can really do. They'll have to find out on their own. I just hope they don't have to go through what I went through. And all in all, despite it's good results in my life and mentality in general, I wish it never would have happened in the first place. It was literally hell and about half an hour of heaven. The best and worst I've ever felt in my entire life, all in the same 48 hours.And that's the truth. That's all we, or I really know for sure.

I had gone by my friend Ryan's work to see how he was doing. We chilled there for a bit then he asked me what are you doing tonight. I said man we can do whatever you want. He said 'Well man I'll call you and you can come over to my brothers house, we are going to get messed up over there tonight.' I thought to myself damn its going to be one of those nights. Little did I know what kind of night I was getting myself into. Me and my friend Ryan had been talking about doing acid for about a month now. I told him that I have done shrooms and it was great. His older brother Shawn said he had done acid, but it had been almost 3 years since. I was at my house when Ryan called on this Friday night, he said man you will never guess what I got, Acid he replied. 'Get your ass over here,' he said. I went over there that night, that was the biggest mistake I've ever made.When I walked through the door Ryan handed me a six pack of beer. I drank five of them in about 30 min then out came the acid. I was very scared to take it, I kept thinking damn I have heard some bad shit about this, but I thought oh well who cares, so I took two hits, along with Shawn and Ryan. Directly after that this girl said I have some KB (kind Bud) lets smoke. I was all up for that , we hit that bong countless times. I would say somewhere around 8-10 each. It had been about 40 min since I had taken the acid. Around 10:10 pm I started to see tracers and just felt great. There was a girl named Laura with Shawn she knew of all these little cool things to do to enhance the trip. Things like reach for the devil, and running through the forest. How was I to know I would soon to be right with the devil. There were 7 people there, 3 of which I had just yet met. One of the girls pulled out about 25 tabs of X and I was like of man I have got to do one of them. At this time I was feeling the effects of the acid way over the weed and alcohol. I took one exctasy tab and waited for the effects from that. About 30 min after that tab I took one more, then another, then me and Ryan snorted one.About 15 min after that, the feeling I had was the best thing I have ever felt. The acid made me see life in a whole new perspective. I could hear every little peep throughout the condo we were in. All colors were awesome to me. I just wanted to touch everything. I was like a little lost 3 year old in a new world. The 3 people I did not know stayed in the kitchen most of the time. Shawn , Ryan and I sat in the living room trying to describe what we were feeling. I could slowly start to feel a funny feeling. The sounds were starting to bother me and then the very sight of people started to mess with my mind. I remember people coming up and asking are you cool man, I thought they were all after me trying to hurt me. I just wanted to be alone. I went and asked someone is this what happens on this shit (acid), they said man trust me its the acid taken effect. While that girl told me that I was looking over her shoulder at a picture with a man holding a fork and a plate. His eyes were red with blood so I turned away just walking away from this girl while she talked to me.At that point I could not talk to anyone or look at them. Everyone’s eyes would fill up with blood and then run down there face. The blood would come out from their noses and mouths also. I could not believe this was happening. Everywhere I looked I saw blood. I got out of that room trying to be by myself, I just wanted to be alone. The visual images I saw were so horrific that I honestly am in chills right now and my eyes are filled with tears, I am being serious. I am not tying to add drama so don’t think that. Anyway back to the story. I saw my friend Shawn lying on the couch, I crawled towards him on the floor so he could not see me, I was afraid he would try to grab me. As I peeked over the couch I saw Shawn gasping for air and then the blood came from his eyes and mouth again like before , I wanted to help him , he was suffering, but I was to scared to reach out and touch him. I jumped up and ran for help 'I said Shawn’s dying to everyone' they came running and looked at me and said man Shawn’s fine dude, he taking a nap chill out. The acid made me see horrible things. I kept trying to get Ryan to stay close because I did not want him to die. Then I knew everyone was going to kill me. I honestly can say that I saw the devil he talked to me while I sat in the chair in the living room. He was covered in blood. He was telling me I would be here for ever I could not respond to him I was in shock and torment. I really wanted to die right then.Everyone was in the kitchen and I was the only one in the living room. Ryan said that I was freaking out so bad that nobody could stand to be around me, I just thought they were in there planning a way to kill me and hide my body. I tried to compose myself and watch TV. Bad mistake, I just saw people dying, blood, death, Satan, knives, sharp objects, look the best way to put it is that was having the most evil, and supernatural experience possible. It was probably 4 in the morning when Ryan got me stable enough to go up stairs and try to sleep, key word, TRY. I went in that room and sat the rest of the morning on the floor praying to God to end this for me, I prayed to God that if he would make it all stop then I would never do anything again ever. For the next 5 hours I laid there feeling things touch me all over, where I was laying on the floor was a huge pile of sweet and tears. I cried so much but I was so afraid to be loud because I thought the evil would hear me and come up to get me. I was left alone in that room to cope with the terror and depression by myself for 5 hours. I never said one word the whole time I was in there.Since that happened 3 weeks ago I have found God , I have not even smoked a cigarette or touched one drug or anything bad since. I don’t want to do anything ever again. This experience cause me to lock all my doors during the day, I check behind doors and I have to keep all the lights on in the house at night. I have been over to Shawn’s apartment 10 or so times since that night but I am so afraid to be there, I feel a strange presence in that condo. I feel like all his pictures are still looking at me and they know what happened that night. I couldn't be alone at night for the first week afterwards. I asked Ryan if he would talk on the phone at night along with various other people, they did and I thank them for it , because I would not have made it with out them. That was my first and last time with acid. I should not have mixed so many hard drugs together. I felt the effects of the acid for two days later. My advice to people wanting to try acid is that I wouldn't do it, although everyone’s body reacts differently, and I just had a bad, bad trip. Acid will take you to places you have never seen so I am not saying don’t try it, just know from my experience what could happen. I am a changed man since that night, that truly was a night I spent with the devil.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 9838Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Aug 3, 2004Views: 38,662    MDMA (3), LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Post Trip Problems (8), Hangover / Days After (46), Entities / Beings (37), Mystical Experiences (9), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), Combinations (3), First Times (2) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(liquid) 2 bowlssmokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:140 lbOne evening this summer, a friend (we'll call her Jan) and I went to visit a different friend of mine (and we'll call him Joe). Joe and I decided that we wanted to trip on acid.  Joe had just bought about ten sugar cubes and decided that he would pop one right then, as we were sitting in the parked car w/ nowhere in particular to go.  I chose to take one then as well,  feeling comfortable w/ Joe as my trip partner because he is much more experienced with drugs than I am, and had tripped on acid before. This was to be my first time.   Unfortunately, though, Joe's mom called him home about an hour after we popped the cubes so I was left to face the trip with the company of my extremely stoned friend Jan, who had no experience with acid herself.  I wasn't too concerned, as I could feel that the acid wasn't going to be very strong (though I had not done acid before, I had experienced several incredibly intense mushroom trips, and knew that the effects I was feeling were minimal).  Jan and I went back to my house, and on the way I decided to take the second cube I had purchased.  The rest of the ride was the most intense part of trip, but was limited to changing colors and an incredibly interesting truck, which vaguely resembled a spaceship, in front of me which we followed nearly all the way home. Upon the arrival at my house the effects were already more mild.  I grew bored and decided to try dancing. Wow.  Even though it wasn't strong acid, I clearly understand why people on acid like to rave.... so I danced, illustrating the music with my movements, feeling incredibly blithe and smooth.  This was so much fun, I kept at it for nearly an hour before I decided to open my front door and see what it was like out there.  It was cold (around fifty maybe), but since I'd been dancing my body temperature was very high and i was sweating profusely, so it felt really nice. I began running around, barefoot in shorts and a tank top, sweating and giddy and full of adrenaline, so very happy.... I stayed out there, exerting myself like an olympic athlete, for another half an hour or so before going back in.  I was flushed and extremely hot to the touch, and decided I needed some water.  I drank about nine tall glasses without a thought, guzzled them down in extreme thirst.   My body temperature began to drop at this point, or i had a fever.... I don't quite know... but I put on my sweater, noticing the cramping in my muscles, and  just decided to chill out, assuming I'd be fine, that this was normal after such activities.   I decided to keep a nice intoxication going as the acid wore off, so I smoked two bowls with Jan.  I didn't start to worry about the symptons I'd been having until I felt an intense pain beginning at the top of my skull that wouldn't go away.  It felt like the top of my brain was exploding,  and I could feel the blood was pounding very, very hard when I touched my head.  I began to feel very nervous, as this didn't feel like any headache I'd ever had.   The pain grew worse, and I felt colder.  I reclined on my bed and wrapped myself in a thick comforter.  My heart rate at this point was so fast and yet sort of faint, like my heart was working very hard to pump the blood as fast as it could,  and the pulse was light.  At this point, I am feeling very nervous. I start to feel like I'm blacking out.  My vision goes very screwy, like electric looking and the stripes on my blanket, which are pale pink, appeared to be neon, highlighter green green, though I know this is not a tripping sensation, this is a scary phyiscal illness sensation. as the acid didn't cause much hallucination at all and I had taken the stuff hours earlier, and the trip was, for all intensive purposes,  over. Thusly, I was now panicking.  I don't know how to describe what I was seeing at this point, but it was as if everything was going in and out, going black and electric looking, the borders of things spreading in and out like trailing sort of, but not, like everything I saw was getting bigger and smaller and the borders were layering, the edges moving in almost a dizzy way. It was, I suppose, what happens, when you start to black out.  The pain in my head was still there, and intense. So at this point, I was also having a full blown panic attack. as well.  I decided maybe I was suffering from low blood sugar, and had Jan get me orange juice. I drank a bunck of that, and had something little to eat.  I found that sitting up eased the feeling that I was losing consciousness.  Afeter a while, my body temperature began to come back to normal.  Though I'd told Jan at one point that I thought I should be in a hospital, she just sat there stoned, so I was lucky I started to come back to myself. At one point, I found that being touched helped a lot, so I had her keep her hand on my ankle.  I was terrified the whole time, and sort of angry at Jan because she started to say she had to go home to sleep when this was all still happening, though I didn't let her because i didn't want to be alone (and was really unnerved she'd even think of leaving me like that to begin with).  Eventually I let her leave, as i started to feel a bit better and confident I was going to continue feeling better rather than worse.   Once after she left I felt like I was blacking out again, but than I felt better.  Never, never trip without someone you know you can trust. I think if i hadn't known how to basically take care of myself (based on sense) I could have fared much worse.Exp Year: 2004ExpID: 35940Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Aug 18, 2004Views: 15,959    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), First Times (2), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:110 lbin my short life of 20 years I've done quite a many drug, but none has been so unpredictable as LSD. My first trip at the age of 16 was a life changing experience, I came to realizations about myself that I still follow to this day. However, the second trip I took wasn't so wonderful. Now I was aware that one Tab of acid can range in potency so a tip to all you novice trippers out there NEVER TAKE MORE THAN ONE DOSE. This trip was a Red Buddah, it started about 30-40 min after I took it. I was in a car and it was raining outside and I started to get really claustrophobic, saying 'I need to get out, I need to get out'. I was practically folded in half with my feet on the dashboard in the front passenger's seat. After about 15 min of riding in the car we eventually made it to my house. Now, I thought that this trip was going to be exactly like my previous one, so I thought I could handle it easily. For about the first 2 hours it went well. I was in my house, so I brought my colored pencils and my journal to color with if I so wanted to. I also changed my clothing into my favorites so that I would be surrounded by 'love'. I got my favorite music and the music that I listened to last time, Enya and Sublime. Then I went downstairs to the tv room, kept the tv off and chilled. My brother had also taken a trip so it was the two of us just hangin out. Visually colors were magnified 10x's and the wood flooring looked like water. Everything became absolutely beautiful and I was overwhelmed by life. I came to the conclusion that 'Tripping is just seeing how close to insanity you can go without actually going insane.' My first trip was just in my head, I didn't feel anything, so that was what I was expecting this time. This time though I felt the trip in my body. My fingers would touch something and I would feel it in my hand, not the fingers. My head felt heavy, but I was able to control the fear, reminding myself that I was tripping. I also called my best friend to help keep me stable and from spiraling downward. however at around 2:30 a.m. this was about 2 hrs after the trip started, my back started to hurt. I tryed streching it and it just made it worse. My friend had gone to sleep and I had no one to help me come back up, so I continued downward. In my head all I was thinking was that I was going to die. Because my back was hurting I thought that my spine was being eaten by the acid and that my muscles would collapse leaving me with no control over my body. That then spread to a thought that all my bones would dissapear, but mainly my vertibae. As these thughts ran through my mind, I fell deeper and deeper into a state of panic, almost like a nightmare, with my vision continuously blurring and getting harder to make sense of anyting. The pain in my body continued to intensify, and another thought came into my head, 'What if this would never end. What if I fell asleep and I never woke up, that the reality was that I was in a coma in a hospital bed and all I was percieving was just my mind but not reality.' Well, eventually I couldn't handle it anymore, I seriously thought I was dying, and rather than calling the police, I went to a good friend's house, who I knew woud help me get through the trip. At 4 a.m. I made my brother leave the house with me and we took a cab across D.C. to sit out infront of my friend's house for an hour and a half.the cab ride was torture, I thought I was dying and all I was thinking was that I would die in the cab on the way there. I was so plagued with worry that I couldn't even hold my head up. looking out the window was disturbing as well as everything was blurry and melting. eventually we got to my friend's house and I was thirsty but all we had was gatorade. I didn't want to drink that either thinking 'Gatorade was the anti-water, juts a mix of chemicals, and completely unnatural.' but I was thirsty so I drank a tiny bit. Eventually my friend came home and he let us in his house. He helped calm me down by reasuring me everything was going to be alright and he entertained my brother who's trip never turned bad the entire time I was flippin out. Eventually at about 6:30 am I became sleepy but I was still tripping so I didn't want to go to sleep, still thinking that I wouldn't wake up and the trip would never end. At about 8:30 I did fall asleep and I woke up a couple hours later not trippin but just a bit distorted. this was the scariest experience I've ever had, and actually the psychological effects continued on for a long time - panic attacks, paranoia, depression. this actually lasted until I took another trip a year later which was much weaker and was a pleasant visual experience. So the lessons to take from this story, 1 NO TWO TRIPS ARE ALIKE, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU TAKE AND NEVER EXPECT THE SAME THING2 ALWAYS HAVE A 'TRIP FAERIE' AROUND TO HELP CALM YOU DOWN3the most important NEVER TAKE MORE THAN ONE DOSE(TAB, DROP, GELTAB, SUGAR CUBE) BECAUSE YOU CAN NEVER KNOW HOW STRONG IT IS.Exp Year: 2003ExpID: 36898Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Sep 22, 2004Views: 8,640    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Post Trip Problems (8), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:130 kgOne night, my friends and I decided and I decided that we wanted to trip, we had done so a couple of times previously already. I was really looking forward to it, and I thought that I knew what to expect. We had to go into town to get the acid from a friend of a friend, but this was ok with me. I wanted to trip so I figured it was worth the effort.We got into town, and we walked to the bar where the dealer would be at, we tried to get in, they wouldn't let me in, because of the way I was dressed. This would have been sometime around 9pm I would guess. My friend Matt went in (the dealer was his friend) and Daniel stayed with me, so I wouldn't get too bored. We sat around outside for around 1/2 hour, after which Matt came out. He gave me and Daniel our share of the acid. I went into a stairwell took out my trusty razor and cut my two tabs from the strip, and immediately downed them. I then gave Daniel his share of the tabs. I sat down again, and Matt went back in, I wasn't happy about this, I wanted to go do something, but he had already promised he would. After about another 1/2 hour he finally came back out, by this time the acid was starting to kick in a little. After having done it a few times, I could feel the minor effects rather acutely.We went for a walk, Daniel and Matt wanted to go party, I didn't really feel like it, the acid was coming on pretty strong. We sat down in a park and Matt packed me a cone (bowl), cuz I was feeling pretty strung out, I knew this was going to be a strong experience. I smoked it up, and my two friends decided they were gonna head back into town, i decided that I was going to go home by myself (bad idea, but I didn't know it at the time). Matt being the good friend that he is, packed me another cone, in case I got really flipped out. I walked down to the bus stop, its a special bus that only runs on Friday and Saturday nights. It comes once an hour, and runs from like 10pm - 3am, you catch it to a major station, and then another bus, drops you off as near your house as they can get (very handy).I knew the next bus wouldn't be for like half an hour, so I had no choice but to stand around and wait. At this point the acid started to really kick in, I guess by now it would have been around 1 1/2 hours since I ingested it. There were rainbow coloured rings around the vision of each eye and I was feeling pretty out of it. There were some dodgy looking Aboriginals around and I was feeling rather scared, a few asked me for change, and I told them I only had enough money for the bus (which was actually true). I saw some high schoolers walk bye, from their Prom or something, boys and girls holding hands. I started to feel angry, I felt really lonely at the time, and I wanted a girlfriend badly. Here are these guys walking buy looking dressed up and very happy and I hated them. Some of them were looking at me, and I decided that if I heard one derogatory comment I was gonna start a fight. They passed by without incident and I relaxed a little and forgot about it.Finally the bus came, I hopped on board, and I was having a bit of trouble getting out my money and deciding how much I had to pay. The bus driver obviously knew I was out of it, and he was very helpful I was very greatful. As I have had drivers on this service try to rip me off on the change, cuz they probably figured I was too out of it to notice. I went and sat down around 3/4 of the way towards the back of the bus, the bus sat around for about 10 mins, waiting for other people to come and catch. Eventually though, we got going, on this service they play the radio, and they had some lovey dovey show on the radio, there were couples around me cuddling and kissing. At this point I was feeling so lonely and upset, I was on the verge of crying. I sat there for a while, and I felt so bad, I sort of withdrew into myself and zoned out bigtime. I have no recollection of about 1/2 the bus ride (a 45 minute journey).Anyway, when I came back to reality we weren't two far away from Salisbury (the major stop that was my destination). About 5 minutes later, we arrived there. I got off the bus, and there is another connecting bus that you are supposed to catch, to drop you off near your house. I was messed up and this point, and I couldn't decide whether I had to catch it or not, by the time I had decided I should catch it, it had already left. This meant that I had no choice but to walk home. This is where the trip started to really go downhill. It's about an hours walk to my house from Salisbury, so I headed off. As I was walking along, a weird effect started to happen, I would feel a rushing sensation in my head, and my vision would start (over about thirty seconds) to become sort of fuzzy, everything looked like it was drawn roughly with crayons. After a few minutes I would feel the rushing sensation again, and my vision would go back to normal. Then it would happen again, this happened countless times.This was really freaking me out and I started to get really scared. I started to get really paranoid that a cop car would come by and they would notice I was acting strange and pick me up. I didn't want my parents to know I used drugs. Every car that came by was a potential cop car, and it scared me a lot, by this point it would have been just after midnight I guess. I was sweating like a pig and nothing I did would stop it (overheating is a common and unfortunate side effect of acid). I walked past a service station, and a few homie wannabes came out and started walking in my direction, they were probably 50 metres behind me on the other side of the road. I became really paranoid that they might try to jump me, after about another 5 mins of walking they turned down a side street, but I couldn't calm down. It felt like everyone was looking at me, everyone was out to get me, I was on the verge of crying. I felt like an insignificant little stick figure, up until this point in my life I had never really felt loved, now it felt like everyone was out to get me.I felt helpless all I wanted was to be left alone, I wasn't hurting anyone, I just wanted all the cars and the odd person or two to go away. I started to get angry, I was like, fuck everyone, fuck em all, if they wanna start something, I'll just kill them. This made me feel a little better, although I was still paranoid and very scared. I walked by a street, from there it was only a short walk to Daniel's house, I was feeling in over my head, and I decided that I might go and try to crash at his place. Then I remembered, that I had left him in town, and it was unlikely he would be home this early. So I knew that crashing at his place was out of the question.I kept walking and the whole time, this rushing sensation was still happening (although it was starting to become less intense). I was starting to feel a little less scared and paranoid, although I was still very much on edge. I was about 15 minutes walk from my house, and I was thoroughly sick of walking I just wanted to crash, then it started to rain. I got really pissed off again, bloody typical, I just want to get home, and its raining. Luckily though it was only a light rain, and then I arrived home. I made quite a bit of noise because I was out of it, fumbling the key in the lock etc. Though my mum wasn't home (I lived with her, my parents are divorced) and my brother sleeps like the dead, so I didn't wake him up. I go into my room and look at my clock, its 1:30 am, the walk that should have taken me an hour, took me 1 1/2, because I was so out of it.I collapsed into bed exhausted and tried to sleep, but I kept hearing the sound of a car horn beeping over and over and over again, I just couldn't sleep. This went on for hours, and I eventually fell asleep when it was starting to get light, becuase I was just so damn tired. I woke up around 6 hours later, I felt pretty spacey and out of it, but not too bad, I generally feel messed up the day after a trip. I smoked the cone Matt had packed me and got up, said hi to my mum and my brother, my mum was cool I must have looked messed up, but she knew I had been to town last night, and probably figured I had been drinking. I swore that I would never do acid again, altough I ended up doing it again the next weekend, but that's another story.The moral of the story is, if you are a relatively inexperienced tripper like I was, it is not a good idea to trip by yourself, this is an experience more suited to the experienced user. If you are having a bad trip, it is a good thing if you have at least one trusted friend with you, as they will be able to talk to you and calm you down. Probably not completely, but at least enough to keep you from flipping out. I found that out the hard way, although I apparently hadn't learned my lesson, and it has happened too me once more. Its a scary thing to have to deal with by yourself, please heed what I have just said.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 10659Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 6, 2004Views: 12,814    LSD (2) : Alone (16), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5) DOSE: T+ 0:002 hitsoralLSD   T+ 0:59  smokedCannabis   T+ 1:30  smokedCannabis   T+ 2:153 tabletsinsufflatedPharms - Methylphenidate(ground / crushed)  T+ 7:00  smokedCannabis   T+ 9:00100 mgoralPharms - Trazodone(pill / tablet)BODY WEIGHT:205 lbOk I’m about to describe my first and only bad trip. It happened on xmaswhen I got ahold of 2 hits of LSD, I’m used to tripping alone so I didn'tcare if none of my friends could get out of their home on xmas, I couldhandle this easily....I thought.At 7:45 pm I decide to swallow the 2 hits, then proceeded to smoke some potand just generally chill out.T+ 1:30 The trip isn't getting very strong so I decide to smoke some moreweed, the acid is finally coming up. Some nice red trailers, colors beingbrighter etc. I was thinking this wasn't the best cid I ever had though, noreal intensity, some slight jolts down the spine.T+2:15 10 pm, I am high, no doubt, but out of nowhere, I start gettingsleepy! This was really weird to me, how can you be sleepy on acid, anyway,I crushed 3 Ritalins and snorted them, thinking it would just wake me up,but that wasn't anything near the truth.T+ 3:00  Visuals got stronger, I was happy, gigglin alone while watching the simpsons. Looked promising.T+3:30 My parents get home early from their xmas party! I am very annoyed by this for a few minutes then didn't mind it anymore, I got very paranoid they would notice I was seriously looking higher than anything pot could have done. They went to bed, but that's when the bad trip started.T+4:00 Visuals getting crazy, at this point, my memories are getting hazy, I remember walking around the house, not quite knowing what to do, sometimes staring blankly, I started feeling weird inside my head an body.T+7:00 My condition deteriorated, visuals faded away to be replaced by ageneral feeling of sickness and depression, I smoked some more pot, thinking it would alleviate the way I felt, but to no avail, I started feeling panicky, I got scared of my cat for no reason, thinking it looked at me with contempt. The paranoia was getting out of hand, I didn't know for sure if I was breathing correctly, I felt like my heart would stop, I had a very bad pressure below my left foot and inside my right hand.T+9:00 I had enough, I swallowed 100 mg of trazodone with some cereal andwent to bed, my pupils got back to normal real quick and I rapidly fell into sleep.I woke up at 11 am feeling weird still, smoking some pot made the badfeeling come back a little, but it went away later in the day. This storyreally confuses me, was it the ritalin ? was it because my parents got homeearlier than supposed ? was the paranoia caused by the mixture of ritalinand lsd? the only other time I was paranoid on acid was my second trip with it, and in no way was it THAT bad. I feel a bit depressed since, and generally tired, seems like this experience really wore me off. Might I recommend not mixing these 2 substances.Exp Year: 2002ExpID: 19993Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 29, 2004Views: 25,668    Pharms - Methylphenidate (114), LSD (2) : Alone (16), Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3) DOSE: T+ 0:591 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 10:001 oralAlcohol(liquid)BODY WEIGHT:300 lb[Erowid Note: Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be done casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements were derived, it is reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.] How to begin? Where to start telling the tale of the night my Old Self died, died on my living-room couch? That fateful night had been long in the coming so let me briefly flash back to a few years ago before telling the tale of last Friday, when I died and was reborn again on approximately 150 micrograms of LSD.I’ve been a Psychedelic explorer for 11 years now, and my first true voyage started in 1993 with 1.2 grams of Liberty Caps mushrooms. (Psilocybe semilanceata) I have tripped approximately 100 times on mostly Psilocybin and LSD, using LSD only about once per eight fullblown trips. As my experience grew the trips got evermore intense, the difficult/bad trips started happening and intensified. In my view the so-called ‘bad trips’, Hellish as they may be, are a sign you are experiencing life itself in its fullness, that you do not flee suffering but rather confront it. But since a few years ago something startling started happening every once in so many trips: I felt a Presence, demon or angel I cannot tell, who asked me if I wanted to follow it. And I always knew that if I were to follow that there was no turning back, that I would experience the greatest horrors imaginable. And so I declined, time after time, not ready to go Beyond. Last Friday night no such luxury as Choice was offered to me. LSD took me beyond that threshold and made me face the greatest Hells imaginable, only to discover that the Gate of Heaven sometimes lies in the Center of Hell.One of my Spiritual Brothers and me got together for a weekend-long LSD Session. The plan was to take a small dose of LSD on Friday night and then take a larger dose on Saturday afternoon. We had blotters that had tested to be 50 micrograms and microdots that had tested to be around 200 micrograms of Lysergide.But it was not to be.Blotter sheets, shortly after they are laid, are often hung out to dry. This can have the effect that the lower rim of the sheet through gravity accumulates more Lysergide solution and ends up to be laid with far more LSD then the rest of the sheet. These blotters are called ‘sheet ends’ and it happened to be so that on the night that we were to try a 50 microgram blotter they turned out to be 150 mcg plus, a dose roughly comparable to 3.5gr (1/8 ounce) of dried Liberty Caps mushrooms, or 5 grams of dried regular Cubies (Psilocybe cubensis) as they are usually sold.After having gotten our weekend groceries, dined and waited 3 hours for our stomachs to empty my Spiritual Brother and I each took a blotter of LSD under our tongues to absorb the LSD through the mucous membranes of our mouth. This provides a rapid ascent and greater dose efficiency. And a greater dose it was, easily three times the amount we had planned to take.We were aware in a minute, and steadily climbing some twenty minutes later. About one hour into it, 10 PM, we were clearly on higher ground. We had turned the light off and there were many visuals, but they were bleak. It was hard to gauge the extent to which we were high. It proved to be the silence before the storm. A little later we both were intellectualizing and pacing around the living-room and kitchen, discussing all kinds of matters of the real world. We discovered we were clinging on rather then letting go of consensus reality, so we turned off the light again and looked inward, by which time it was clear that we had widely overshot the mark by three times and that a Great Session was to unfold.A candle was lit and guided our way through the night.We found ourselves intellectualizing once more.‘The Queen ought to come and give us a medal for still being in the Resistance sixty years after the war.’ I joked, and indeed we were fleeing into rationality and again turned to introspection. By now it was obvious it was going to be a direly intense trip.At about two hours into it, 11 PM, well after we had achieved plateau and were subjected to the great mental compressions and decompressions of intensity that are called ‘waves’ I started to feel an all-too-familiar aura. The room was shifting in color and lost proportion, looking almost like it was filled with water rather then air. I knew all too well what this meant: I was in the Place where the Mushroom had taken me several times, but now on LSD, the place that lay between trips as I knew them and the Great Beyond.The Mushroom had often asked whether I would follow, a bit like a telepathic thing or rather an intense thought emanating from my Subconscious. LSD offered no such choice: It pulled me right in, no questions asked. I was starting to feel suffocation, as if I got no air, and this became evermore acute and intense. Finally it overcame most of the Trip and was quite overwhelming.Oh God Almighty.. was I going to die?I decided I had an acute anxiety attack and that the feeling of suffocation was due to hyperventilation, so I slowed my breath and breathed through my cupped hands as to accumulate the CO2 my lungs needed to break the cycle of hyperventilation. It passed, but now my back locked into tight muscle tension like I never had experienced before. ‘I feel like a Ninja Turtle, I already got the half-shell, but it remains to be seen whether I can be the hero I need to be this night.’ Trippers in peril say the oddest things. The suffocation returned with a vengeance.Suddenly separating barriers slammed shut between me and my Spiritual Brother, I was in a cocoon that separated his reality from mine. When he spoke I heard him, but his words had lost all meaning to me. I knew he was making sense but it just did not register. I was mad, psychotic, clinically insane and dying by suffocation. I walked off to the bathroom but was smitten in my kitchen and sat down right on the floor, looking away as my Brother, now quite worried went to sit in front of me and started a talkdown which must’ve been a gem… if only I could register his words because nineteen out of twenty times I just could not understand and was kept away from his tender loving care.‘Ooohh.. I want out… Yup I want out of this mayhem.. I got a goal in life and that is to make it out of this insanity.. This is the grandmother of Bad Trips…” And my grandmother had died. And I was to die that night in agony and insanity. My friend rationalized away, very deeply involved in his Trip but committed to get me into the good space where he was. He had Trust and I trusted I was fucked.‘It can’t BE worse. I have reached rock bottom.’ I replied to my Brother’s question, or at least I believe it was a response to what he said. I got up and hugged my Spiritual Brother with all my might. ‘Life is so hard.. It is so hard to hold on.. I don’t want to die…” he lovingly held me in his Spiritual embrace and I cried lamenting my life. I believe he must’ve cried too.After three million years we let go.I went to the bathroom and slammed my ass on the bowl. The bathroom door and walls breathed and closed me in, but not nearly as closed in as I was by my isolation from reality. I leaned with my head against the wall and was consumed by the torment. I was beside myself, sometimes on the outside, or above, looking at my tortured self just sitting there. I put my hand on my bare leg and looked at it. My hand lost size and shape, my leg bubbled and boiled as if it were full of reptiles fighting their way out of a leathery egg.‘Oh GOD… Help me PLEASE…’  It couldn’t be more from the heart. I was at the end, Sheet’s End, in the bowels of Lysergic Hell.And then I felt it. That is when it happened. Amidst my suffering I sensed I was not alone. A benign force was with me. I felt the Presence of God. Somehow it felt like matter became transparent. I felt the Cosmos as One. I felt the galaxies through the walls and straight through the earth beneath my feet as if it were somehow transparent as glass. My Brother asked if I were OK.  Yes. Somehow I was. I was an Organism, a suit of flesh wrapped around an Essence that was I. And I was not alone. A Force that encompassed and permeated everything was with me. The Universe was the Body of God and all matter was his Flesh. There is nothing but Deity, and nothing does not follow the Master Plan. And my Hellish Death was entirely symbolic and I had to go through it that night.Off the toilet. Dying outstretched on my living-room couch. I felt a calm come over me. I remembered it well: It was the calm I felt when I lay on the Heart Ward of the Intensive Care Unit with my heart attack, and Death was imminent. It was the Calm of Death.This time a peace came over me that reassured me it was truly good to let go, even if I were to die by ceasing all struggling.My Spiritual Brother was talking non-stop trying to get me out.‘No: It is my destiny that I must die tonight. I’m going through a Grofian cycle of Ego Death and I must complete it. If I don’t complete this I will come out of this trip insane. Let me die.’‘Well, DIE THEN!’ my Spiritual Brother blurted out and seemed to feel sorry.‘You are forgiven. All is forgiven.’ I said this from my death bed. I would die, there was little doubt that at least my mind would die and that death was imminent. Then he asked if it were good if he left me to go to the bathroom. I said yes. He went, and I would die.Peace in Death. Tripping is for real. Having had a true Near-Death Experience I can vouch for the facts that the fears and torment that accompany Ego Death, and the calm that may follow, are identical to the struggle of Biological Death, exactly the same and every bit as intense as it can be when you will die.I closed my eyes. ‘Goodbye, my Ego. I have loved you with all my heart, but now you must die, die so I can be reborn anew. Goodbye, my Old Self…”The calm gripped me. I saw veins, and the blood sinking down through them. I saw my body as if from a distance. Detached from it. Totally in peace. Time dissolved. My Spiritual Brother returned and I snapped back into my body. He pounded away with his good intentions, but sky-flying on LSD his mind was vexed by my agony and he had locked into talkdown-mode.  I got up and ended up on the kitchen floor again. He sat down in front of me and we established connection, slowly but surely he got me in tune again. Bless him. I was amidst the stars, the Earth and bricks of my house transparent to my mind and at one with Deity, the Deity that is the Universe, the sum of the Anything & All. I still was in pain and very much out of tune with my Spiritual Brother. But I was returning to normalcy, my Brother talking me down from the agony that still was.‘Keep going: I don’t know what you’re doing but it’s working.’Slowly my agony dissolved and gave way to what Eastern Paths and the hippies of old call Cosmic Consciousness. I was emerging from Hell to find Heaven at the deepest depth of it. I looked at my Spiritual Brother. I was still a million miles away, my mind separated from his by the cocoon of realities. It dawned upon me that each organism is like that: fully isolated in their own universe with but few ways to communicate between them. He had told me it was 1:30 AM which now dawned upon me and it gave great comfort. I was smack in the middle of a raging LSD trip, approaching or already in the peak. I wasn’t insane, it wasn’t the aftermath with me emerging mentally unstuck: we were four and a half hours into it, a good two hours before the descent would even present itself.‘I want to be who I am. I really want to be who I am.. I want to LIVE..’This was far more then a yearning for sobriety: this was nothing short of a renewed commitment to life itself. I felt profoundly changed after my Ego had died on that couch. I was no longer suffering. I was tripping on LSD once more. I wanted to go outside to see the Cosmos, my Spiritual Brother opened the door and told me the sky was overcast by clouds, no Cosmos to see.‘Oh trust me: it’s there.’Back on the couch. I closed my eyes and there was so much to behold, most of it symbolic and three-dimensional. Suddenly I was gripped by imagery.  I saw Africans. Men, women and children, not just imagery but I felt them like I had been them another time around, that I had known them. I held their memories and accumulated them until it seemed I felt what seemed like racial/ancestral memories, the suffering and greatness of our African heritage and those who remained in Africa after my later ancestors left it for the lush forests of Europe. Then, when the fullness of the experience was reached, the imagery and experience shrunk into the tiniest of the tiny and merged with a tiny speck of a geometric patterning I saw before my eyes. I felt like all this was part of the pattern, and that the pattern was the Energy Form of the Universe. We got up off the couch again into the kitchen. I was overcome by the organismic Experience. My Spiritual Brother and I so clearly were animal beings walking the surface of a planet, I felt One with all the Beings that ever were or will be. I sliced an orange in two and shared it with my Brother. I leaned to the sink and sank my teeth into it, overcome by the organismic experience of eating. Suddenly I was overwhelmed by the feeling of being a young African boy, leaning against a hot loam wall in a village eating a fruit. This lasted a split second but gave me great joy: I knew I had been that boy in a former life and would be him again, fully convinced reincarnation is absolute and the Divine Force is perfect and infinite. Then Divinity let itself be truly felt and filled me. My Spiritual Brother talked about his love and devotion for Jesus Christ. ‘Back off with that Christianity!’ I said rather harshly because I felt the Divine Force touching me, that it was All Gods of All Religions, that he was Jesus and Mohammed and Buddha in one, and his loving words from his Christian faith felt like they fenced in the Deity that revealed itself to me right then and there. The God/Goddess/Force truly is the Anything and All.I remained in Cosmic Consciousness for the longest time, aware of the galaxies and stars that are all around, aware of this Force that was the Anything and All and acutely aware of my organismic nature and our shared but separate universes. Beyond the six-hour point we started a peaceful descent and discussion of what we had experienced but I was too overcome by the naked intensity of what I had lived through to grasp his experience, no matter how I wanted to I was filled to the brim.‘God is ready with me this weekend. I will not take LSD again for some months but I definitely will take it again.’About on the tenth hour we popped open a beer to celebrate our Journey, and later on we went to sleep. We clanged together our shotglasses of ice-cold Jägermeister and toasted.‘To Brotherhood.’Then he went to the guestroom and I went to bed myself. In darkness there was much imagery but all too soon I drifted off into deep sleep. My final dream before awakening was that I stood in front of a closet with many compartments and was neatly putting matters of Life into the appropriate compartments. When I woke I sat down on the couch where my former Ego had died hours ago. I wept overcome by the sheer beauty of the Divine Force that had revealed its presence to me. I was in awe and joy. I grabbed the phone and called my other Spiritual Brother, a Tripteam-mate who couldn’t make it to this Session and blew him away.‘Full Intensity. I lived my worst fear and got through it. I feel reborn. I know I will meet with these Hells again, and far worse then I did now, but I know that if you truly surrender to Hell, Heaven awaits.’We talked and talked until his mobile phone battery went flat and that night he joined us. We embarked on an MDMA-Journey which made it the best Session the three of us have ever had.The Spiritual Brotherhood, the Cult of Three...Explorers in the Further Regions of Experience.Exp Year: 2005ExpID: 39856Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 19, 2005Views: 20,710    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Bad Trips (6) DOSE: T+ 0:592 hitssublingualLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:59  smokedCannabis(plant material)  T+ 1:002 hitssublingualLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:59  smokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:150 lbSo far I haven't found too many other reports of persisting conditions similar to mine, so I'm posting this in the effort of gaining more information on the condition, flushing a few others with a similar experience out of the woodwork, and reassuring (to a certain extent) those others.Before this particular experience, I was a fairly experienced user of marijuana and mushrooms, and lightly experienced in the use of LSD (2 months, approx 10 trips).  I've always been a lightweight when it comes to pot smoking, and have shown signs of Acute Panic Disorder when smoking too much.  I had previously never had any negative experiences with hallucinogens (I was arrogantly hoping that I would get to deal with a bad trip, so I would know what it was like).The dosage was fairly normal to start with, 2 hits on paper, dissolved sublingually for quickest onset.  I then watched a movie with a close (also tripping) friend, and had some minor visual effects, along with the elation of coming up on a trip.  We both smoked some weed during the movie, which added to the effects and led to some severe time dilation.  While the movie was only approx. one hour in length, we found ourselves surprised that the acid hadn't really started to kick in yet.  So we headed upstairs and took another two hits each.  The sensation of the acid dissolving under my tongue suddenly caused the full effects of the first to kick in, amazingly strong.  This gave me a moment of pause, but I'm a fairly competent and cool-minded individual, so I managed to shrug it off.I remember there were some mind-blowing visual and mental experiences in the meantime, which I can't remember much at this point, but it all took a turn for the worst when I started to feel a numbness in my limbs.  Unfamiliar with the multitudes of psychological effects LSD can have, I thought that it was an indication of some impurity in the acid, and that thought sent me into a horrible spiral.  I think I could have managed it fairly well, but my friend handed me some pot 'to help calm me down'.  As only approx 45 minutes had passed since my last smoke (it felt like hours), a few tokes put me into a full-blown panic attack.For those who aren't familiar with panic attacks, they often come on hard and fast, without regard to logical reasoning on the part of the victim.  Often there is a feeling of being both too cold and too hot at once, and an immediate concern over overheating/hypothermia.  Heart race is increased due to adrenaline and the mind locks on to this as a sign that something is wrong, making the heart seem unnaturally fast...Often fear of death comes along with that, but I haven't feared death in a long time.  For me, the fear is that I will remain that way forever.  Some other effects include concentration on breathing, being convinced you are going to pass out, and an undeniable urge to keep moving.This panic attack was particularly horrible, having all of the symptoms listed above, compounded by the enhanced mental state from the LSD.  This was a full-blown bad trip, and I knew I had another 6-8 hours of it.  I managed to keep a cool outward appearence to avoid setting off a negative experience for my friend, but inwardly, it was horribly intense, and very disturbing.  I felt like calling 911 at one point, but was calmed by the fact that LSD does not adversely affect the body (though I still had some concern of it being laced).  It took a long time, but I finally went to sleep, exhausted.Everything went back to normal for a while, wherein I went back to just smoking pot every now and then, in moderation (3-4 hits did it for me just fine).  However, at a later time, while I was at a friend's house a few months after the initial experience I took a single hit of particularly potent pot (below my normal threshold for a marijuana high), and immediately went into the full-blown panic attack again.  This was highly disturbing, but I decided that if there was such a problem, I would just avoid pot.  Well, the next six months or so were very unpleasant, as the panic attacks would come fairly frequently, 3 or 4 times per week.  They got to the point of causing me to be very disturbed and non-productive.  I went to a psychiatrist and they immediately diagnosed me with mania and threw pills at me.  I went to another psychiatrist and they immediately diagnosed me with depression and threw pills at me.  I really dislike psychiatrists...I used the medications as a stepping stool to understand and analyze the panic, get to the root of it, and solve it.  A year later, and I still have the effects pop up now and then, and I have to be careful when using any substances that alter consciousness even in the slightest.  Also, periods of shifting mental state (going to sleep, meditation, etc) can bring the attacks.Due to the decreased amounts of attacks, I believe that the problems will eventually cease, but since I haven't found too many accouts of this, I can't be sure.  I hope this comes in useful to someone.  Remember, it WILL get better, if you let it.  Get through panic attacks one at a time, and keep working through your life.  It's hard, yes, but sometimes there's a price you pay for expanding your consciousness.  I think of it as a lesson in caution and humility, and I suggest all users of strong hallucinogens remember to show IMMENSE respect to them.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 14910Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Apr 7, 2005Views: 29,772    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Bad Trips (6), Post Trip Problems (8) DOSE:8 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:130 lbI hope this isn’t too long. This trip is absolutely 100% pure reality, and in fact there’s more than that that I experienced, but I just don’t want to put it all in here. I made contact with several different entities. But anyway, this all happened to me, and I believe that it’s possible to achieve that state of consciousness other than using drugs. I know I have felt extreme states of ecstasy, purely without drugs. Since past experiences, I have stopped using drugs of all kinds because I know where they all lead me in the end. Drugs are a gateway to consciousness, but what is not achieved by natural means falls back. Every action has a re-action. What goes up must come down. That’s how drugs work with consciousness. I got to see heaven, now I get to see hell. My experience at least. Anyway, thanks a lot, this was my pleasure. Ciao, baby.All righty folks, this is a reply to the article entitled Eternal Terror, Fear and Torment. Yes buddy, I’ve been there, I know what you felt, but hey man, maybe I can clear up a few things for you. I hope so.My trip was like yours. First I experienced Heaven, Then I made a mistake, like Eve, and bought into the illusion of Hell. Of Good and Evil. But that’s not important, the only thing that could ever matter is the experience of God. I’m sorry if this sounds like spiritual nonsense. Even if it is though, just read it, it’s really, really interesting. At least I hope it is.I’ll give the details of the procession of steps that lead up to the realization of the presence of God.I dropped the ’cid, and it took about 25 minutes to kick in. It was very fast, and I was very, very high. The hallucinations were incredible. I saw waves of energy connecting with my thoughts. The more loving the thought, the more affect it had on the outside world. It was hard not to be loving in that state. I was in love with everything. I loved all my friends I was with and I still do. I was immersed in the beauty of everything and everyone. The tracers were crazy. I would move my hand in one direction, and the trace flipped back and forth three or four times before coming back to my hand.My thoughts seemed to say so much, seemed to have so much power. I was aware of the increasing soul to soul contact happening with everyone on the bus I was on at the time. As the communication initiated and grew, the flow of love grew to a state beyond anything I can explain. My whole body was filled up with this ecstatic, flowing energy. My spine felt like a big energy converter, with big lightning bolts running up it, then flowing down my arms, out of my hands into my head, out of my heart, out of my eyes. My hands seemed to move into positions on there own, only because of that energy. It was like my hand would open up like a flower, just to let that energy pour out. it was quite amazing.I could see the energy, not with my eyes, but I just knew what it was doing, because I felt at one with it. I could shift consciousness at will, so I could see further down the road, further to the side, maybe to a distant friend, maybe above my head. Stop and rewind at will. Look into the future. See down a thousand years.I realized that the soul was one with God, and so everyone’s soul was like the a holographic replica of the same existence. At the very base, we are all the same. This contact was startlingly evident. It was like not only I was telepathic, but so were the people around me. One girl, a very loud, eccentric girl, was in fact reading my thoughts and responding to them out loud, although if she was aware of it I know not. I know her soul was though..The realization was only building up to this point. It wasn’t fully experienced, and thoughts kept on racing around my mind. Right now I was mostly interesting in direct communion with God, and the value my desires seemed to have.I desired not only to know that I was one with God. I desired to experience it with another! I sat and looked at the people ahead of me. I saw the twinkles in there eyes, yet they were not looking directly at me. Why did they hold back? What are they afraid of… Every time I thought about them, and how much I wanted to see them eye to eye, they just sort of smiled, yet they didn’t look me in the eye, so it was odd. I swear, I must have had angels looking over me that day.The moment of realization came when a friend of mine answered my pleas for full fledged contact. She initiated the God contact by a gazing look into my eyes. At first I resisted, but then I grasped the courage to look into her eyes and experience who I was without denying anything, and boom. All thoughts stopped. The silence was overwhelming. My Lord, this was beautiful. In one instant, I understood it all. God looks God in the eye and realizes its love for itself. Such an experience brings leaves one breathless, tears to fill the eyes to say the least. You see, I had never left that state of union, but by some weird unfortunate accident, I merely forgot. It really wouldn’t have mattered how long I had forgotten. Whether asleep for 1 or a thousand years really seemed to have no significance. It was all the same to me. In that presence, one split second of the presence I felt, and everything else seems like a fleeting dream in comparison.In every person I saw, the one soul was there. It was the same unity looking out of everyone’s eyes. It was full fledged acknowledgement on its part. It was unbridled, it was not denied, it was something never before experienced. It was heaven on earth. The souls of others so beautifully understood this, even if the ego did not. People seemed to exist on two levels at the same time. On one level, the ego is functioning, yet at the same time below all of that, the soul is really running the show. The soul is all that matters, and nothing happens without the soul’s consent. Nothing. Even a trip to hell. It may be very subtle, but trust me, it’s all that matters. Whatever happens, it’s meant to happen, says the soul. All’s perfect, from every snowflake to every strand of DNA, to every spiral galaxy and beyond. That’s God. The ultimate mathematician.In this state, just about anything was possible. I could create universes and galaxies at will. I could zoom back to past lives at will. I saw who I was, who I had met, who I knew that was in this life, but also others. We were lovers, we endured tragedies, sometimes you were a hero, sometimes you were the idiot, sometimes you were…anything…trust me, you’ve been there, you’ve done it all… we’ve all been the victim, the lover, the hater, the hurt little child, that’s why its easy to forgive others. That’s not who they are. Egos only exist because they don’t know any better. They don’t know that its okay to love… who would in our society? It’s so unacceptable… the status quo is the ego, not unifying love.That’s sort of… well, it sucks, because the only thing that matters, out of all of those lifetimes, is how efficiently love is expressed. It’s like, that’s really all the soul wants to remember. One can spend a lifetime hating and cursing, and know not much is going to come of it, because one can spend a lifetime loving and enjoying and appreciating, and baby, the soul's going to remember that. If a person only did five minutes of real love in one lifetime, that five minutes would be the absolute highlight, over everything that they ever did in their life, that would be what the soul remembers, and relishes. Love is where the soul shines. Love…Anyway, I also saw some of those who had experienced this state. A sense of utter peace that no one can explain to you. You just are. Nothing else is needed. That’s what its like. I could even control my present reality. I could stop, examine it, go backwards in time, stop it just like I do on a VCR. This was all very cool. But then I got a sense that something not very cool was happening. Something very serious, very bad, very wrong was coming down onto me. This is the thing that to this day gives me uncontrollable flashbacks. Not the flashbacks where I see hallucinations. But the flashback of the experience.Because…this is where I made a boo-boo. This is where I made a mistake, this is where the descent started. It felt like I was reliving the fall of mankind. I felt as if I had arrived at the gates of hell. The words: The fall, fallen angel, evil, LUCIFER especially, had great significance to me. I experienced their reality only too well.I was being arrested by the police. I felt that these people were not my enemies, they were trying to take care of me, yet the problem lay not in what they were doing, but what was about to come. The aspect of my soul that had experienced the future brought back very grim news for me. It was like the soul was saying, OK buddy, get ready, brace yourself. You’re really not going to have a fun time here…this is really, really bad…Why I was arrested really doesn’t matter. I did nothing bad, I screamed at people, but in a friendly way believe it or not. I knew this was friendly because they smiled back at me and even talked to me. Think about the drunken hobo who’s all very joyous, yet still yelling at people on the street. That was me. In fact, I gave away 80 dollars, a bank card, a bus pass and an I.D. to various different peoples… still… I shouldn’t have done any of that, man.Don’t worry though, the bad part isn’t quite yet. There’s still another part I have to describe. It was like, I stopped existing as a person. My persona had completely disappeared, and all that was left was pure witness. I was taken out to the ends of the universe, the ends of time, even to the very, very beginning of the universe. My exploration of universal unity led me there. It felt like I was looking down the window of time and the universe. It was like an endless street of bright blue white light. It was celestial and so very vast. From this view, I saw how the universe began. How did I happen to know this? Well, I started to hear the sound of a flute… It blew. It blew again… this was a pattern, it blew, and it blew again. then it blew, and it blew again. From this, sprung forth karmic patterns that would intersect with each other in perfect mathematical synchronicity. They went to the ends of the universe, in a billion trillion different patterns, and at the end of eons, would return to one another. This was yin and yang. This was where all patterns of the universe, everything, originated. These two principles of yin and yang directed every single particle in the universe. All karma was the result of this. It was like it was so very simple, just two patterns, yet from them sprouted incalculable complexity. Everything had already been set, now it was just living itself out. Like a wind-up clock watch. Very similar to that.Basically all manifestations arose out of this dual yin yang cycle. You were the watcher of the duality. You were non dual, you were only the witness of the process. You can see it in nature. Nature is the creation of this. Physical life itself is the result of this. DNA! The two strands. This is Wholly Duality, sprouting out of Wholly Unity. That is my understanding. Perhaps they are one and the same, I know not.Anyways, I happened to wonder if I was in the void, only because It seemed to go on just forever! Thousands and thousands of years, celestial eons, or was it a fleeting second? What would be the difference…Freed from all concepts of myself, I completely forgot my individual identity, and there I was, left in the celestial space for eons. I began with the start of the cycle, and saw it completely itself, no joke, millions of times. I saw the cycle grow, and come back again, then grow and be even larger, and then come back again… all very interesting. I had acquired so much. ‘So this is all I’ve gone through,’ I thought to myself. I didn’t know if that’s what it was, or if it was the future. I just didn’t know. Maybe one day though.Anyway, I was in that state. I was mesmerized in this cosmic dance, this cosmic history. I saw different races evolve and fall, I saw the encyclopedia of the kingdom of God. Quite large and impressive. I had fallen into hypnosis almost, forgetting that I was even aware of it. So I woke up and became conscious of it once again. I thought, Who am I? What am I? I had no recognition of humanness, let alone Peter-ness.That startled me. Wasn’t I something before? In that moment, a prayer went out to God. I was in this celestial voidness, or so it seemed to me. I had become static, unmoving. The prayer had the affect of starting my personal karma again. Starting time again. So time started, and slowly, the energy and karma worked itself back so that I became conscious of my physical surroundings once again.Of all the places I could possibly return to, I returned to a prison. This is what my soul was telling me about. This was the dead-serious part. I was in a cell, I was in a land of shadowy figures, and the energy here felt really, really bad. It instilled me with a cringing, neurotic, hopeless sense of fear. Oh, that fear is bad, really, really bad. But, then the cops came in the cell, and started beating on me. See it turns out I kicked a police officer in the head, although I have hardly any recollection of that, but I guess the cops wanted to get back at me for doing that. So these officers came in to the cell, cuffed me to the cell bars I think, and kicked me in the head a few times. It really, really hurt and I felt so hopeless, as the warm salty blood leaked from my head. God, I was still chained to the fucking bars. After awhile they took that off, but my right hand is still recovering from the numbing tingliness that happened when the cuffs pinched my nerves or something.That was my physical experience, but I was still quite active psychically, and more than anything, that was what I was concentrating on. I could still see back and forth between dimensions and time-lines, and I knew that I was at the gates of hell. I saw who had been there, I saw that they had to walk through that gate, such terror it was. Worse, much worse than one could imagine. I saw that they experienced damnation forever. It was a very tragic state to be in. Before I had this experience, I never thought much of the Luciferic. Before that, I only thought in terms of body. I thought it just meant people who were jerks and beat you up and whipped you and treated you like they do in prison or in boot camp. That would be really fine and dandy if it was all that, because all the physical torturing one can imagine, is really just ‘openers’ as one man described it. All that stuff in is just child’s play compared to meeting Lucifer head on. Just getting all nice and warmed up for the real thing.In the real thing, there ain’t no joking around buddy, your fucked. you know your fucked, for eternity, and there’s nowhere to go. That’s how it feels. Impending doom, ultimate void, ultimate destruction. The most blood curdling feeling of doom imaginable. It felt like the rebellion had actually undermined God’s power. They had caught me, there was no escaping it now. Oh sure, they offered me a few ways out. Lets see, killing my loved ones, slitting my wrists, dropping more acid. After that I would go on a rampage with an associate and in the end I would kill her, then I would go to court, and then I would kill myself. But it would be okay! Because once I died, I would be taken back to the realm of God. They told be that I was ‘sent’ here. That I was on a ‘mission’. Very convincing lies folks. Trust me, if you ever encounter these forces. This energy. Pray, pray like you’ve never prayed before. Whatever you do don’t believe or buy into any of their tricks, no matter how great the synchronicity, no matter how convincing the lies. They are fallen ANGELS. Masters of illusion and celestial knowledge.I don’t know, I don’t think anybody who hasn’t been there can know what it’s like. But the thing is, like I said. its all based on a lie. Remember how Lucifer was an Angel? OK, so angels have knowledge of the Divine, of Eternity, and of the soul, so it seems as though one of the most advanced angels fell from God’s love into great egocentricity, and then used all of that knowledge to attack souls, making them believe that this hell was actually real eternity, when it is not. The reason it’s not eternity, is because you are experiencing it. God is still with you when you experience hell, because to even suggest that God isn’t with you is impossible.Basically, you buy into a big, big illusion. The trap of egocentricity. If you follow the ego long enough, that is where you will end up.So anyways, that’s one level of hell. I'm sure there’s worse, I haven’t been there, I hope no one goes even half as bad as that, but believe it or not I also went to the higher levels of hell too. There’s a lot of wanna-be impostor Lucifers, that’s basically what hell is comprised of. There’s demons, full of hatred, vampires, but the most tragic thing is there is also poor souls just like you and me who are trapped in this suffering. Their lives aren’t based on hatred, self-serving, Luciferic energy, but more based on tragedy, guilt, shame, and hopelessness. This is where most people commit suicide out of this level. I saw this, I experienced the energy out of which countless people commit suicide. I saw them in Hell, I saw there tragedy. In this level they were not tortured by physical wounds, but more mental woes.Although not even a fraction as bad as the confrontation with the Luciferic, these people still do live in a hell. It’s like these people are sinking lower and lower, and at the level of the tragic and suicidal, there is immense sadness, followed by a sense of loss of hope, and BAM… one is confronted with the most unloving energy imaginable. It humiliates, it insults, it blames, it makes a person feel horrible. They moan, they cry, they wallow in there misery. Some grab each other for comfort, others are taken away, others are all alone. Eternal solitary confinement.This is the exact opposite of God. Poor, poor people. Well folks this is where the lower astral is. With LSD, you can venture psychically into these different realms. That’s all a bad trip is, a trip to the lower astral. So, if I have any intelligence, I'm going to want to change the way I live now because, where do people go when they die? It depends, right? God is a million times better than the devil because God is me, and the devil is separation.It’s not that they’re opposites, it’s that one is true and the other is false. Truth has no opposite. Just as light has no opposite. Dark is not the opposite of light, dark is the progressive loss of light. That is hate. It is also like heat. There is only one variable, the presence of heat.Think of this diagram. Heat is love, and water is consciousness. At the very highest levels of heat, water turns into steam. The soul releases all its weight and becomes one with all there is. As it lowers down, I suppose one reaches the water level, which could be compared to Earth (purgatory!!), love isn’t overflowingly eternal like it was in heaven, but hate isn’t disastrously confrontational like it is in hell. But then it gets cold, and but happens then? Well, it turns to ICE. Hell, the frozen lake of Hell. Dante’s Inferno? You interpret it. At 0° Celsius, there is a change in character of the water. Suddenly, the recognition of all that is loving changes, twists, turns backwards, and perverts. Suddenly, everything starts slowing down, until one is left with dead cold, void of heat, static, still, forever. Welcome to my home, says Luci. LOL.So guys, that’s my story. The moral of the story is, God is still with you, even then, your just not really aware of it. Hell will pass away, but God won’t. So just choose that which doesn’t go away. That’s what can happen when taking acid. Things that nobody should ever know about. Sometimes ignorance can be bliss. Even if none of this is true, I just hope that that person who met the devil reads this. It’s long and detailed, but sometimes it has to be. Anyways that’s my two red cents.

Living will still have beauty.  You are not alone.  I have seen total eclipse without hope of day.  It took years but I am happy with a loving partner and a healthy sane life.  I am a better,  more aware, more caring and happier person than I would have been without these experiences.  I would not change the choices I’ve made:It started with 2 hits of Blue Microdot.  The 16 hours or more of tripping was only the beginning.  It took years for me to stitch myself back together.I ate 1 and a Half hits of LSD, and I insufillated another half.  Then I smoked about .2 grams of Hash.All ready I felt uneasy, that something wasn’t right.  It didn’t take long before nothing was right.It is unexplainable…  Beyond a thought, or feeling, or sense.  A door opened…  I was flooded with a new “seeing”.  I was unprepared and resisted.  This is when I met with insanity.I won’t go into the details of my complex and confused mind.  It still give me shivers.  I’ll just say that without a doubt that I was now insane, and going to stay that way for the rest of my life.Metaphors grew out of nothing.  A string of strange coincidences and some strong acid made me believe that I was suddenly in on some syndicate that operated on a psychic level., through metaphors and “feelings”.  I was being welcomed into the circle.  Insanity was a network.  I didn’t want to be a part of but it was too late.  Then I “realized” I wasn’t insane but “dead” I had Overdosed on LSD (I now know this is impossible) and I was riding in limbo needing to choose heaven or hell. My cousin who I was close to all my life was cool with smoking cigarettes, weed and was high on the same LSD(having a great time with it I might add) became to me, a manifestation of Satan. My older brother who was as clean as they come and totally naive to drugs became to me a manifestation of Jesus. Of course I followed him around all night bugging the shit out of him to take me to heaven.  This scared the ever living shit out of him. At one point I pissed my pants on purpose to try and convince myself I was still alive… But the trip had roots… and that was not enough to snap me out of it.  I was willing to do anything he suggested… However with his inexperience he would tell me to do things like go to sleep…  Go lay down in my room with the lights off.  There my body would feel as though it was disappearing.. That I was slipping into hell. (I wish now that I would have let go and experienced my inner workings). I lept out of bed and did anything I could think of to get to heaven. I even tried calling my parents who were away on vacation. I went through my peak doing these random and frantic things as I was certain I was going to fall into hell at any moment.That night was long.  As my cousin and I came down from our trips he ultimately talked me into finally going to bed and getting some sleep… I don’t recall if I actually ever slept.  He left the next afternoon.What is most formative and important is the week, and then, years afterward.  A journey few people will ever make in this life.  The first week I spent afraid, confused, unable to eat or sleep.  Alone in a true dementia.  I’d watch Television and it would be spewing messages directly to me.  EVERYTHING was a metaphor for heaven or hell, or a message from this syndicate.  I began to believe this blanket of metaphor was a secret code that the world spoke and I was getting hip to it.  Going down to Strawberry fields.  Still, nothing really made sense… all a jumble.One night that week I went to a friends house and believed every sentence they said to one another was linked to my dementia.  Another close friend, who definitely knew I was in trouble said that he believed life was a test… and that everything had a reasonable and rational answer.  Dunno if that’s absolutely true, but it snapped me into my first taste of reality in over a week.I decide it was time to drive home to my parents house to reconcile my mind.  I entered the house not really knowing what to say or do…  I began telling them about this experience I had… Telling them that I had achieved a higher state of consciousness… etc.  They looked frightened and confused.  I realized that so was I. Suddenly I broke down…  Began telling them about my use of LSD, Marijuana and other  Drugs, how I was out of my mind, paranoid and afraid.   Just the facts.  My mother cried and my Father listened stone silent.  That night was the most relieving and uplifting of my life.  Likely the most difficult for my parents… all they could do was listen and hug me…  This ladies and gents was way out of there league.  I knew it… I knew I was teaching them.  What mattered was that I was in a place where I was loved and accepted.  I was 16 years old and I slept on the floor at the foot of their bed. I released all my secrets.  If there is a sacred confession. This was it…  I was cleansed by fire.  I felt as though I rose from ashes…  and I did.  That night I was utterly humbled and humiliated by existence.  I was a child again but also evolved.  The next week I didn’t leave my parents house I helped them with various jobs and house projects… If I found spare time, I’d find something to fill it.It was like every day I died.. and re-awoke.  Every day I teetered between heaven and hell.  Small decisions like “Which juice shall I buy and drink?” were wrapped in meaning and metaphor that extended beyond daily life, seemingly deciding my eternal fate.  Just under everything was a mechanism, a test or a plot…  Unraveling.  I saw powers that we are all capable of…  The power to live or to die any moment… I began seeing through the facades of judgment and morality.  My learned belief systems eroded and were replaced with experience.I’d raise my concerns with a close friend who had had similar experiences.  He would console me, encourage me to believe in what was in front of me, work with what I knew and be wise not to open up these thoughts to the wrong people, as most would just label me insane and become afraid of me.  He was of course totally right and a good friend for his patience and protection.For a time I lived my life shadowing my true thoughts and feelings about daily situations.  I made some stunning life decisions.  I traveled overseas alone to search my soul and mind.  I shed all my addictions, tobacco, TV, caffeine, sex, all drugs, and even meat/processed foods.  This was all between the ages of 16 and 23. It took me over a year till I could even talk to my cousin again.  Many more till I could truly trust him.I wish that databases such as Erowid, The Shroomery etc. existed when I went through this journey.  Their help could have turned this vicious, horrific and difficult experience into something meaning full and useful from the beginning.  Much of my “delusions”  weren’t so at all.  This life, this existence is a blanket of meaning and metaphor.  Everything we see, touch, hear is a creation of our own perceptions.  This can drive you mad, or make you powerful, exalted and blissful.I am 27 as I write this.  The lessons and impressions left by the LSD trip, the full week of dementia and the years of re-evaluating evolved me to a state of consciousness few ever reach.  I am at peace with myself and my existence.  I don’t want to die, but I am virtually unafraid of it.  I see through the bullshit of war, violence and destruction.  I seek and participate in peace.  I believe we all wish to.  LSD helped push these to the front of my consciousness.  I had to go through hell.  But these moments I now live are truly awake and free.To this day I wonder if I'm actually “alive” or if  I’m alone - A drifting consciousness lingering in an endless construct of my own imagination - It doesn’t matter really.  I found peace.Exp Year: 1995ExpID: 43800Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 25, 2005Views: 99,418    LSD (2) : Post Trip Problems (8), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:0.125 ozsmokedCannabis(plant material) 2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:125 lbMy experience of experimenting with mind-altering substances has been fairly good, except for the following trip I’m about to explain.It all started on a fairly warm March day. It was Friday and I had been suspended that day for leaving school earlier that week. I enjoyed my day home from school mostly by playing video games on my computer, until my friends were out of school. I had made plans to party with some of them that night, and so I called them around 2:30pm.After a short conversation, I left my house and headed out towards their house. I had a small bag of pot, maybe a 15 sac at the most. I stopped into the woods shortly to smoke a bowl to myself, before arriving at my friend’s house. When I got to my friend’s house, we went to her upstairs were she lives alone to chill with 2 other friends who were already up there. My friend Jason had an 8th and so we mixed are weed together and rolled 2 cannon sized joints, which we smoked. After that I was pretty stoned, and Jason was even more stoned. Then my other friend Shannon said that she would be right back because she has to run an errand. Jason and me went outside and walked around until she got back.When she got back she had with her 7 blotter stamps of acid. We went back inside and she took 2 hits of acid, and handed me and Jason each 2 hits. I was already stoned by now, but I figured what the hell, and I took both hits. After about an hour my high from the weed was coming down, and I was not feeling the acid at all. Shannon was in the other room listening to music, and Jason and me were just chilling in the kitchen waiting for the acid to kick in. At about 5:30 (an hour and 10 minutes after I took the acid) I began to feel the effects rapidly kick in. I began to see the room sway very quickly, and when I looked at Jason he just diminished into nothing. I could still hear him talking but I visually could not see him. I began to panic and so I stood up, and he re-appeared. Only this time he was very blocky looking, almost as if he was a sprite in a badly rendered video game. By now he was also tripping off the acid, and was repeating his name over and over.At about 6:15 I was seeing very intense visuals. The room had departed itself from the rest of the house, and was now an inner chamber where only the sinners who abuse drugs go. I suddenly had a strong feeling to leave the room or I would die like the rest of the sinners. I got up and could not even walk straight. I managed to make it to the next room where Shannon was laying on the bed, and looking at a poster. She began talking to me, but her words meant nothing to me. They were all distorted, and because of the fact, that I could not understand what she was saying, I felt as if she was going to try and trick me into doing something, where I would get hurt.I had very intense feelings to leave the house. My mind was telling me that the people in that house were going to die, and only I could help them. I began to fall into a dreamy state where I envisioned my friends in that house decapitated and dead. When I would go back into the house to make sure they are all right, things would look normal, but not feel normal. I heard voices telling me to help them or they would die. I rushed into the house and told them to get out of the house as fast as possible. They told me I was fucking crazy and to shut the hell up. I explained my visions of what I saw and heard, and they told me I was just tripping too hard. Hearing this put me into a very depressed state. I was depressed because I could not view things in the psychological way that I was just doing before they told me I was just tripping.Since my parents were gone until later that night, I decided to go home for a little bit and mellow out. I left at about 7:00pm, and took a walk home that was un-forgettable. The 15-minute walk seemed as if it took 2 hours, and everything was just in a hazy dazed state. When I got home, I went straight to my room and sat down to relax. I couldn’t relax though. I felt guilty, as if I failed my friends in helping them. Then the worst part of my trip began. As my guilt and fear got bigger, I decided I might have to kill myself, to release the guilt. Suddenly a large and unexplainable amount of fear came over me. It was the kind of fear as if, you know someone is about to do something very harmful and hateful to you and there is nothing you can do to stop them.I began to panic, and ran for my bed, were I went under the covers and tried to sleep. I could not sleep though, I felt as if somebody was watching me, and when I looked out from my covers I saw a large shadow on the wall.My fear diminished and I began to feel excited and confident, that everything is fine. The shadow began to take form into a real mass, not just a shadow. Yet it had shadow traits, it still looked like a shadow but it was 3 dimensional, and had eyes and talked. It was a very fearful thing to look at, and my fear quickly overcame me again. The shadow figure told me his name was Omeg and he was here to punish me for not helping my friends. I was so scared I began to cry and pray that my trip would just end. I told the shadow figure that I was just tripping on acid and it was just a visual. This reassured me for a little bit of time, but fear returned when the visual shadow figure would not go away. He told me a visual is not able to do what is happening to my mind now, and he reminded me of the fact that my friends were all dead.In a rush of fear I sprung up, put my shoes on and left the house. I had no idea what time it was, but it was dark. I went back to my friend’s house I was previously at, and chilled there for a while. The next few hours I experienced very vivid color patterns and visuals streaming through my head at one time. I feared with every new color scheme that entered my mind, that Omeg the shadow man would return. At about 5:30am I came down off of the acid, and remained in a dazed state for the next few days, thinking of the last trip.I have never done acid since, in fear that Omeg would return. Where I possibly could have imaged Omeg in my mind is still a mystery, but I have learned that mind and mind setting is always important before taking acid. When I took the acid on the trip I just explained, I did not think about what effects were gonna effect me at all. Now I know better.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 13120Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 30, 2005Views: 8,602    LSD (2), Cannabis (1) : Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Entities / Beings (37), Combinations (3), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(pill / tablet)BODY WEIGHT:200 lbIt started out as a 'normal' day, went to work in the morning, Saturday, to help out my then girlfriends father. My girlfriend at the time had been telling me about how great acid could be and we'd done it a couple of times. She was always talking about orange double barrel (microdot) and how great it was. She had gotten her hands on 4 hits and we'd decided to take them that night. It was late November and it was cool, which is good because on acid you sweat like hell, and we were looking forward to taking the acid while camping in a field nearby. It was a clear night when we set up camp around 10 pm. We'd taken the acid about an hour before and when we were finished setting up our tent we started to trip. We decided that we'd better make a fire before we were too blasted to know how. We went and gathered all kinds of wood from the nearby woods and made a fire. The sky was clear and stars were everywhere. We really started to trip at this point just laying there looking at the stars which felt like they were going to crash on our heads. The whole universe seemed open as if I was falling through space. Every once in a while I’d sit straight up scared as hell because I felt as though I would crash into a planet.It started to get really cold so we decided to get into the tent to 'warm up' We did the usual, an hour or so of foreplay, hour of sex, laid there for another half an hour, by this time I was getting really claustrophobic and needed to go outside. When I unzipped the tent, I freaked. It was a blinding snowstorm. All the trees and the ground had about 15 inches of snow. I was lost, didn't know where the path was to get out and was really starting to get scared. I was running through the field naked and my X was following me telling me to put on some cloths but I couldn't make out what she was saying. It was like the end of the world. I felt as though the apocalypse had came and that this storm was the storm to end all storms. She finally calmed me down enough to make me understand that I needed to be clothed. We were both very cold as we didn't really prepare for a blizzard. We decided that the best place to be would be by the fire. We were sitting by the fire on a log and a big truck comes roaring through the woods.....well that was it, I was totally fucked up. Picture yourself, tripping hard, middle of a field in a snowstorm, and a 4x4 comes ripping through the woods. Thank god it was only my friend 'T', whom I’d mentioned that we were coming out here to. Needless to say I was glad to know that we weren't the only 2 left on earth and that the storm was starting to die down. There ended up being 18 inches of snow that night.In retrospect the night was poorly planned. We didn't listen to the weather, weren't expecting snow, didn't have any flashlight (I don't know how she found me when I was running through the field naked) and I was scared as hell. I felt as though the earth was coming to an end and that. We were all going to freeze to death in a storm to end all storms. I've never taken acid again and the girl and I have broken up and I've been happily married to a great woman now for 1 1/2 years. That trip changed my life and I'll never take acid again.Exp Year: 1997ExpID: 8643Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jul 1, 2005Views: 5,916    LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:005 hitsoralLSD(liquid)  T+ 0:155 hitsoralLSD(liquid)  T+ 0:305 hitsoralLSD(liquid)BODY WEIGHT:160 lbIt was the summer. My best friend at the time picked me up and we went up to his place in Marietta after picking up another friend. That particular friend just happened to have a vial. And he was just giving it away. Partly because it wasn't his.Anyhow...we all take about 5 hits to start off and the effects were just kicking in about an hour later when we decided that we were not going to leave very much left. As Corban was dropping hits on peppermints, Solomon and I were cooking some food to eat before we would be incapable of eating. We ate and then dropped some more, about 5 more each. About 15 minutes later, Corban throws me the vial and starts laughing. I took another 5. Solomon and Corban each took 2 more.So I went to the bathroom later to wash my hands and look at myself in the mirror. That's when I noticed this painting that had been in that house for years that I had never really taken careful note of. It was so beautiful; it was a majestic seashore with a city in the distance, I couldn't believe how beautiful it was.What was cool at the time about this place was that you could smoke inside. However, after eating 15 hits of high quality acid without gum, juice, or mints, and then eating ramen noodle, lighting a cigarette is not really the best thing to do. The acid was already coarsing through my spine, but my stomach still wasn't too happy. As soon as I saw that picture and lit that cigarette, it was all over. I was puking like crazy.Unfortunately, I was looking towards the shower when I started and I didn't make way to the toilet. Now, normally, this is not a big deal. I ran the water through the shower head, but nothing was draining. It just so happened that a dog had been cleaned in that shower the day before; the drain was clogged with dog hair.It was sick and gross, but we decided to clean it up later (how??). We then went driving around, picking up some frozen pizzas along the way. A trip to the Marietta Sqaure resulted in some unforgetable laughs, as well as just walking around in some parking lots.By the time we got back, it was like 4 AM, and we had to work the next day at 7. Knowing there would be no sleeping...we tried anyway. I was the only one who freaked out, but freak out I did.Having my eyes open was the only thing that kept me from going insane. Every time I closed my eyes, bad things started to happen at an alarming rate. I pleaded with Solomon to turn on some tunes. The tunes made it a little better, but over time, it didn't help at all. We tried having a discussion which was getting really cool, but by that time my headache had gotten so bad, that I couldn't keep my eyes open. But the alternative was even worse. I took some aspirin, put a hot washcloth on my forehead and tried to get through the night. I still don't know how I did; what was going on inside my head isn't really fit for general consumption.I can't even tell you how terrible it was. I left so much out here. It's what going on on the inside that matters, and with acid, when it's pretty, its beautiful; when it's not, it fucking terrible. The idea of drills, ear canals, blood, and sex should give you an idea of what it was all about. It was non stop, unless I had the strength to open my eyes, and then everything would subside...until I closed them again. I had no control; I was helpless.And I think partly the trip got so bad was the underlying assumption that I had never eaten so much acid and that since I had eaten so much, certainly something bad was going to happen. If I didn't have that thought nagging at my brain, underneath it all, I think I would have been fine. But it's over now, and I'm fine.Exp Year: 2004ExpID: 37816Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jul 2, 2005Views: 7,222    LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Overdose (29), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:3 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:170 lbMy girlfriend just went to college, and I was a little depressed about it but I thought it would be OK. So I decided it would be fun if my friend and I tripped. We each took 3 hits of very good blotter acid and started our adventure. We went over to his house right after we dropped to eat some lunch and wait for it to set in. Right when I was starting to come up we went to the mall to see all the pretty colors. We got there and went around the place for around 2 hours checking out stores and watching people. Amazing colors spring over everything, morphing and dripping people, those good crazy LSD visuals we all love. My friend is also in college (I’m in high school), and he needed to take some of his stuff back up to campus 30 minutes away. So I called up my mom on my cell to ask if I could go. She said no. This put me in a bad mood and it was the beginning of a downward spiral.We got in my friends car and started back for his house. I was really pissed about my mom and demanded to go home so I could go to sleep. (I already knew it was impossible to sleep on acid, I don’t know what I was thinking). He tried to talk me out of going home, but I demanded so he agreed. I climbed up the stairs and went to my bed and thought about things. Would I stay with my girlfriend through college? Will she meet someone else? Why am I tripping-- I love her and I told her I stopped doing drugs. I started to miss her terribly and I broke down crying. This is a bad thing on acid to be alone because if no one talks you out of being sad or flipping out it will just get worse. And it did. I found myself rolling on the floor trying to make the trip stop I wanted it to stop at any cost I was so afraid and sad. Needless to say it didn't stop.So it went on like that for a few hours, just me crying and feeling terrible. Then my friend calls me up and says that he’s going to come get me. I get in his car and stop crying, but I still feel bad. We went to his girlfriends house and talked for a while until the trip was over.I’ve done acid at least a dozen times. This was my first bad trip, and I don’t know when I'll do acid again. It was just so scary. I don’t know how I kept self control. I could have easily flipped out on my front lawn and got arrested by the cops. I was even almost ready to tell my parents I was tripping just so they could calm me down. I think from now on I'll stick to guaranteed happiness drugs like low dose DXM, and oxy.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 9188Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jul 4, 2005Views: 11,345    LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Alone (16) DOSE:3 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)   inhaledInhalants - Nitrites(gas)BODY WEIGHT:70 kgI had tripped many times before the night in question and was quite adamant that I wanted to get really out of my box. A close friend and I decided to buy 10 paper acid with the idea of meeting up with two other friends at his flat and eating them one by one until the desired effect was upon us. I must first describe the room that we were tripping in, it was called 'the tripping room' and my friend had spent a long time creating it. The room was about 15 feet by about 12 feet, on the walls, floor and ceiling there were items designed to batter one's head. The walls had big psychedelic spirals painted on them, there was a stuffed boiler suit with half a cap as well as half boots assembled on the wall to give the impression of someone emerging from within the wall, the lamp shade was made out of different keys, the radiator looked like a giant barcode there were pictures all over the walls floor and ceiling, a plasma ball, putty that was very squashy and glowed in the dark and bounced like a power ball when thrown.The seating arrangements were met with four chairs (1960's swivels) placed in each corner of the room, mirrors with broken mirror stuck to it caught our reflections. The night began with the usual smoking of the weed and chit chat, following this we laid out our chosen drugs for the night. I had four acid as did one friend the other opted for a gram of speed as he had been eating it all week and had not slept in that time at all, the final mate had some acid and some speed about two tabs and one gram. We all had one item and waited still smoking and talking trying to generate the right feeling by talking of past trips and experience as the feeling's began in our stomachs the usual knotted giggly thing so I then decided to eat two more tabs.At this point we decided to spur things on a bit so we poured the contents of two bottles of poppers into a bin bag and boffed it. This had never been tried before and it produced the most incessant laughter ever, it also created a time tunnel. All of a sudden the floor was changing into a bouncing sea of colour leading up to the walls then the walls were changed into the wibbly wobbly stuff. At this point I tried to describe amid the hoots of laughter what I was experiencing but we were all entranced in our own worlds apart from John, from what I could make out he was just sitting staring. After I would guess about an hour of this everything and everybody stopped the laughter and I said 'fuck me what time is it my friend said 'let me see your watch' and proceeded to lift my wrist up for a look the other tripper said 'it's never that time though' and then me would all burst into a mad fit if laughter and then we would stop rewind and replay that event exactly the same for the next hour.Following this, things changed and I was overcome with a sense of utter madness and total lack of control over my thoughts they went shooting out of control and I felt like I was travelling through time because I was having so many thoughts every second. I then became conscious of my breathing and heart rate they were both slowing down and then they stopped just then I started to taste blood and could see it dripping off my hands. Following this I could see myself walk towards the balcony and fall to the ground. I was then standing over myself and could see I was dead, bones were sticking out broken glass was stuck in me and I felt plainly calm and peaceful. Then I heard shouting and my head was moving from side to side after a few minutes I began to realise it was my friend's slapping my face and trying to get me to calm down. I could only make them out in between flashes of sounds and colour and this I was convinced was the after life I totally believed that I was either dead or quite mad! this feeling lasted for another three hours were I just sat and chanted 'I am not dead I am not dead.'Finally I was starting to realise that I was just tripping when my friend (the one on speed and no sleep) began to twitch and cry, his muscles were tightening and relaxing and he was in a state of utter panic later we realised that he had suffered a breakd that you are taken to if your not careful that your brain cannot handle. Get this one weown. This stuff is to be treated with respect and handled with care take your time when tripping don't rush the rush or it will bite you. I have experience since my silly days of working with people who have done similar things to me and there mental health has been damaged forever. Yes it's great fun and an interesting journey but your head has waters that are totally uncharted so there are placesek after this experience my friend and I decided to do it again as we thought we understood that situation by using many hours of reflection on the above night. Let me tell you it's not something that can be rationalised the mind is all powerful and I ended up just sitting for hours chanting to myself the same shit I had said the week before 'you're not going to die you're not going to die.' Take care and let's hope there's still a world left after Bush's decision on the fate of the hijackers and the countries that helped them.

I was used to my friends acting strange as they had been experimenting with LSD over the last few weeks, some of them even longer, I was curious about it as my friends had told me about the strangeness of it, and how it had changed there way of thinking for the ‘better’ (in some cases it was for the worse) and that it has opened up some part of the subconscious that they never knew existed. Most of my friends were over intelligent university students that came from upper class families, and I was like the odd one out that came from a lower class family, I was like the novelty poor person of the group, being I was not from a rich family and did not have a great education like they had, and was unemployed, and going nowhere fast. You would have thought it would have been me tempting them to do drugs, but it was they who were pressuring me. I was cautious at first, even though I had heard the horror stories before, of what can go wrong, and had even seen someone a few weeks before have a bad trip, which in a way made me scared, but at the same time made me even more curious about this mysterious little pill, as the people taking the drug seemed so convinced that they could actually see into some other reality, or even dimension; they were so convinced of it that I started to convince my self I would be able to handle it so that I could see first hand what they were talking about, and that it was the ‘cool’ thing to do. Also if I took it, I would at least be accepted into the group more, as someone that knew about these secret spiritual things like they claimed to know, and would be able to join in more with there in-depth conversations about god, and time, and spirituality. So I asked one of them to get me one, for which they cheered me on. One of the biggest mistakes I made, was getting a blue micro dot, the most powerful form of LSD around at the time. Anyway, I took the pill with a litre of cider (another mistake) being cider is full of acid. We were in a student’s bed sit, he had no electricity, so we were sitting in candle light, anyway fifteen minutes past nothing, thirty minutes past nothing, forty-five minutes past and I began to feel a little odd, I looked at the walls and watched the shadows moving around on the walls from the candles, and thought they looked odd, but I still felt happy and comfortable. Then after about a hour after taking the micro dot, I started to notice one of my friends sitting in the chair, and he looked at me in a sinister way, and said something along the lines of, ‘Are you in the twilight zone yet?’ and as he said it the room felt like it was melting, and it felt like I could feel the sounds in the room on my skin as warmth. I was still thinking with a straight mind at this time, although I was hallucinating, I was still in a normal state of thinking. I remember telling my friends that I can handle this, it’s bizarre, but I could handle it (or so I thought).I remember my friends talking about some of the strange things that happen in a LSD trip, such as it’s impossible to tell the time, or to judge distance, as it’s like time and distance do not exist, which was a discussion when they were talking about hallucinogenic drugs and spirituality, and how shamans use hallucinogenic drugs to communicate with the spirit world. I remember thinking, ‘Of course you can tell the time and judge distance, I’ll just look at my watch, and you’ll be able to see it.’ So I looked at my watch and bizarrely there were abut twenty hands on the dial, so I could not read it; I looked at my friend’s digital watch and the digits were 88:88 like it had been reset, I asked him what the time was, and he said it’s *&% (a clock I heard him talk, but when it come to the point that he said the actual time, I could not hear him, others tried to tell me, but the same thing happened, there voices went silent at the point they said the time. I think this is the point I became freaked out and started to worry, and decided to try and walk out side.When I got up and waked from the room and stood in the hall, the atmosphere changed from comfortable to dark and oppressive, the shadows now seemed to turn into creatures on the walls, I heard them growling and whispering about me, then I looked down to the floor boards I was standing on, and they started to fall away beneath me, and under it was flames and fire, the next thing I remember was someone saying, ‘For God’s sake, help him,’ because apparently I had started pulling my hair out in clumps (something I do not recall) as I just did not understand what was going on. One of my friends then got up and took me downstairs, and outside, he tried to put his arm around me, but I thought it was a snake, so I just freaked out more. Anyway, after some convincing he got me outside.As soon as I went outside the atmosphere changed again, but it was less threatening, everything seemed sparkly to look at. Although I was scared, still it was not half as bad as what I had just experienced in the bed sit. My friends followed behind, and they decided it would be best for me not to be in that candle lit bed sit again, as it was that that seemed to be causing me to have bad visions, after some time one of my friends Colin that was training to become a psychologist, started talking to me, and was starting to calm me down. When then I turned and looked down an alley way that was dark, and saw two dark figures huddled together talking and whispering. I thought they were demons and were plotting against me, and then something really odd happened; the shadows I saw on the walls as creatures in the bed sit were now surrounding me and growling at me, they kind of reminded me of the demons in the movie Ghost.After starting to panic, my friend Colin told me to think of God, and as he said that a white illuminated mist started coming up from my feet, and I could feel it touching my face and skin, then I looked back at the alley where the demons were, and they were gone, I then looked up and saw a silver sparkling stairway. It looked like a stairway to heaven; my instinct was to try and walk up it, as by this time I was completely delusional. And away with the fairies, my friends started laughing at me because I was stomping on the grass thinking I was walking up steps, and my legs were giving way because I thought I was going higher up the steps, and thought I was no longer standing on the grass. After some time I was told to forget what I could see, and he then told me some stuff that I can’t remember now, but it was something he had used in his psychology class about the yin and yang, and about that I should accept that light and darkness were equal, and that there was nothing I could do about it and that I should face my fears, and that my subconscious mind should find a way of accepting this. As he said this, I felt a sense of peace I had never felt before, both the demons, shadows and the stairway vanished, but had all morphed into one, and were now blended into everything I saw around me. The trees were swirling and sparkling with all the colours of the spectrum, the clouds and moon were spinning with vivid pretty colours, like a psychedelic video, this was pretty much how things would be through out the rest of the night. I never saw any other hallucinations, other than the swirling colours that seemed to radiate from everything, and they seemed to connect everything together, and I somehow saw and realised that everything was living and alive, and was one. It was as if my thoughts were solid and had mass, and that they connected to my environment. I could again feel sounds physically, and the environment in some odd way was something a part of me, I felt so connected to the ones around me, and felt love for them, even the ones I normally did not like. Things seemed more realistic to me then than they did before; I had never felt so alive than in comparison to what I felt before. Normal reality seemed less real; I think unless you have experienced it you won’t know what I mean. Another odd thing was something moving like a leaf floating down from a tree, made a sound like twinkling, when normally a leaf would make no sound, and when people turned there heads, I heard a whooshing noise.One of the only things I did not like in this new found peace, was the frustration I had when I would get these huge bursts of thought to come to me, that made me think, ‘I understood the universe and everything in it.’ I had it on the tip of my tongue, and I told those around me that I knew the answer to life, and everything-ness, and they would say to me, ‘OK Barry, tell us what is the meaning to the universe,’ And I just could not spit it out, I could not get the words out of my mouth, no matter how hard I tried, but I swear blind some how I knew it, and it was the most frustrating thing I have ever felt to this day. It was like one side of me understood the secrets of the universe, but the other side could not comprehend it. Anyway after a while, about ten hours in all, I came down, and started coming back to reality, and over a day or two got back to normal completely. But my ways of thinking had changed dramatically, I got a job, I stopped fighting, I stop taking drugs, I became a better person, and started learning everything I could about the after life and spirituality. I became a pacifist, and an animal lover, I became a hippie and later a pagan. The experience was terrifying yet awe inspiring, but I would never do it again as some of the people I did it with today have mental problems, so it’s not all good.My reason for posting this is because I had a dream about this last night after talking to my girlfriend about it, and it has brought back some memories of it, and has made me wonder again is LSD something that just causes the brain to hallucinate, or is it something that actually opens up apart of the consciousness that is able to see into other dimensions or realties? Was I just seeing a bunch of crap that my mind and surroundings caused me to experience? Or does it open up a door in our own mind, that allows us to see a perception of things more complex, and of a higher understanding that what our normal waking brains experience? I do not know the answer to this, but it has sure changed me and made me think more about things I would not normally have done before hand.I believe shamans and tribal people use hallucinogens because (to them) it opens the door to the other worlds, in where they can see, and communicate with beings or things in that world, and that they connect with it both physically and mentally. It’s like we are interconnected with all things, and beings that are all around us, all the time, whether they be physical things or spiritual things. The spiritual are a reality in their mind state, just as the physical is a reality in our mind state, and are all in a sense morphed into our natural environment, and ours into theirs. Maybe the same applies to our lives and there lives we are all connected. Maybe they have drugs that make them have strange experiences where they can see glimpse into a window into our world? God, if you like, is like one huge mass of energy all combined into one. Maybe these drugs can open something up within us that lets us have a glimpse into that window of the bigger picture of things, but unfortunately our physical brains are limited, and can not perceive that bigger picture, as a spirit being might well see it. This experience seems to have taught me that the spirit world is all around us, its represented by life we all see all around us, it just seems that our physical world seems to give it a image that we all perceive as being ‘normal’ reality. I think the laws of the spirit world are probably extremely strange, and alien to us.I also find it fascinating that it’s said that time and distance does not exist in the spirit world, and when I tried to tell the time or hear the time when on LSD, I could not understand it no matter how hard I tried, I mean I could not even hear someone say, it or even judge the distance from me to a wall near by.One of the things this experience taught me was that maybe certain drugs like LSD can open up a part of our being, that allows that ‘God effect’ to be felt or experienced. I do not think that the answers to God can be found in a pill its self. But the drug might let us experience genuine ‘God effects’ in the state of mind a pill might put us in, or that it might open some kind of strange door to a world far beyond our range of understanding. Remember we only use a small percentage of our brain mass; could certain drugs make us use more of that brain mass, letting us see something we do not normally notice around us? Even science admits that energy is all around us, but we do not always see that energy, or even know where it comes from; maybe some drugs can help us see energies that are normally invisible to our every day senses.All the best,FaedenExp Year: 1994ExpID: 42273Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Aug 4, 2005Views: 41,886    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Entities / Beings (37), Mystical Experiences (9), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), First Times (2) DOSE: T+ 0:001 droporalLSD(liquid)  T+ 1:451 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 2:151 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 2:301 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:00  oralAlcohol BODY WEIGHT:60 kgI took acid for the first time on at the Beltane Fire Festival. The Beltane Fire Festival is a Pagan celebration of the coming of Summer which is held yearly in Edinburgh on top of a hill in the centre of the town. It’s a large event drawing an estimated ten thousand people a year, from hippies who are there to go stoned, drunks, parents with kids to people tripping their balls off. This year I fell into the later category with my first real trip on LSD.To begin with there has been here in Edinburgh an acid drought much like the rest of the world. However it looks like someone wanted everyone to have a good time at Beltane, rumours were that someone had managed to stockpile a vast quantity of acid just for this event and it’s certainly believable. For a substance which everyone always has plans in the works for that night five people I knew had a bottle of a hundred drops each not to mention the numerous trips flying about. So I was set for my night out, I bought three bits of blotter from a friend and had another drop of liquid lined up from a different friend. The initial plan was to have a drop and then save the tabs for later experimentation.So at about 9:15 I went to my neighbours to meet my friends and get my drop. By 10:15 I was feeling highly energized though as far as I was concerned this was nothing to do with the acid, this was simply me getting in a mind frame and setting myself up for a good night. Some of my friends enthusiasm was rubbing off on me as well as it was to be his first Beltane and he had no idea what to expect. We ended up leaving my neighbours at about 10:30 and walking up the hill which took us half an hour, picking up more people on the way. By the time I arrived at the hill at 11 pm I didn’t feel up at all in the slightest so I decided to take a tab to ensure a good time, placing one of the tabs beneath my tongue for a few second before swallowing it. I forgot about taking the acid as I know the best way to kill a trip is to become too expectant of something happening. Some time later I decided I had been ripped off on the acid as I hadn’t had any effect yet so I took another tab. My friend the tabs had came from had previously been ripped off when buying forty quids worth of tabs and I had decided that he had sold them to me to make his money back as I can be a bit paranoid at times.The first of me realizing that maybe the acid wasn’t fake came when I was wandering about the hill with a few friends. Someone came up to me and said, ‘You're Mirsha aren’t you?’ it turned out to be someone I had spoken with online but not met in person. We chatted for ten minutes in front of these really bright lights before I wandered off with my friends again. After walking about for ten minutes we arrived back at the lights and I said, ‘Those lights look familiar.’ My mate pointed out we’d walked in a circle but I couldn’t believe him, we’d been walking in a straight line from my point of view and I loudly argued that it was impossible for us to arrive back at the same point if we had taken a walk in a straight line. This was further reinforced when the blokey I had just met said hi to me again and pointed out I had returned to where I started.We left the hill shortly after that as nothing much was happening. Me and my friend had lost everyone else so it was just the two of us and we were getting more and more mashed, it was cold and there wasn’t anyone we knew so we went to the club we had planned on going to earlier as we knew we’d meet more people there. On the way down in my slightly disabled state I decided to throw caution to the wind and took the third and final tab leading me to having taken four hits of acid over roughly two and a half hours.By the time I go to the club I was wonged out my skull. We went straight to the dance floor to dance and it felt like I was in the middle of the most exciting and energetic crowd ever, but when I put a hand against a wall everything would suddenly shift back into focus and it would just be a bunch of fucked people dancing with lights going off. It was about at this point I started to get really completely fucked. I was seeing visuals everywhere and just generally loosing the plot. The DJ played Krekc by Speedy J and every time a sharp chime sounded my vision would just kind of change to this fractal image I took to be my brain and I would see white flashes going down what I took to be the neurons of my brain. I was literally watching cognition at work and was utterly memorized by it. About ten minutes later the DJ played another tune, Remodel by Michael Forshaw, which is a truly evil song. It features a deep rumbling bass line with large crashing cymbals and a very fucked up noise which I dubbed squirrel noise, for when the tune was being played I was watching squirrels running about in the lighting gantry doing normal squirrel things. The next tune was Paranoid Dancer by Johannes Heil, which has these really distorted vocals saying ‘P-A-R-A-N-O-I-D’ and such like things. By this point I was looking over my shoulder every thirty seconds trying to work out who was whispering in my ear, telling me I was paranoid. It was at this point I decided to get off the dance floor as the music was starting to freak me out a bit and I was begriming to feel a bit overwhelmed by the experience.So this led to me going to the toilets and sitting in between two sinks for what seems like half an hour chatting with various people and staring at the urinals as the piss was climbing upwards trying to escape and I could see shimmering flashes running along the urine. At this point my next door neighbour came in to sell a drop of acid and some random person came up to me and asked me if that was ecstasy in a loud voice. Seeing how I was fucked but not stupid I decided to not talk to this person who was shouting at me, ‘DO YOU HAVE ANY ECKIES?’ He followed me about for a bit and kept coming up to me and saying ‘I know you!’ but I was in no state to tell him to fuck off, so my friend did! Then I turned to her and asked her, ‘You can see him as well? I thought it was just me,’ in my completely wrecked state I had just assumed no one would be so blatant about getting drugs so he wasn’t real so I didn’t have to deal with him. Next I noticed that life was a bit like The Sims, everyone had a thought bubble above their head which showed what they were thinking of. It was easy to see what people were thinking about which made it easy to go up to people and talk with them, the only problem now was that I had the exact same conversation, word for word with five different people. I put this situation down to ‘shoddy programming’ and I couldn’t believe the makers of this game had been so lax to only put in one conversation into this game which I had decided was the Drug Expansion pack for the Sims.About this time Holy Ghost came on to do a PA. I don’t know what he was doing on the stage but what I saw was ambulances coming through the wall every five minutes, dropping off dead bodies which the front man would cut up, then the bodies would be loaded up on a different ambulance which would quickly drive off through a different wall. I really had to get away from this as there were just too many people about and I as starting to panic a bit with all these really freaky visuals.So I returned to the chill out area where I quickly found two of my friends in a similar state to me to chat with. We were both pretty much speaking nonsense, at one point I succumbed to aphasia and whenever I tried to say something sensible it would come out as gibberish though I knew I had said it. After five minutes of really thinking hard I got my power of clear speech back and was explaining to my friend exactly how completely wrecked I was. I can’t remember what I said to her but she turned around to me at one point and said, ‘Ross, stop being so paranoid!’ My only answer was a quick retort of, ‘Who told you I was paranoid?’ Thus began my descent into a classic paranoid trip.My friends left to go to the second dance floor which was playing hip hop, the music instantly freaked me out as I didn’t enjoy it, so I returned to the chill out area on my own to relax. Upon sitting down I watched someone come up to me, put their hands in my pocket and take out my mobile phone and wallet and walk off. I was too wrecked to really take notice of this until it happened again, and again… Paranoia was really starting to get the better of me now and I started descending into a really freaky mental landscape. My thought process just collapsed in upon itself and I found myself unable to focus on any single thought for more than a few seconds which really freaked me out. I decided that I was in some form of hell and I would be trapped in this club for ever. I noticed that the PA was playing a tune, 4 am at the Crying Cactus, which I had blatantly heard being played for the last forty-five minutes non stop even though my mind told me they’d never get away with playing the same thing for forty-five minutes. I was here to stay forever and whenever I thought about leaving my mind would wander off track and I’d realize I was trapped again.It took all the willpower I own to get up and make my way to pickup my bag and coat and leave.Now I was confronted with a new problem, a friend I hadn’t seen in a while turned up just as I was trying to get my coat and she demanded I go dance. My mind was now playing tricks on me trying to concoct reasons why I should stay and be trapped forever by throwing a women at me who was attractive through ‘beer’ goggles, but not without. As she tried to persuade me to stay I blinked and in that moment when I opened my eyes again she was standing there wearing nothing but stockings and suspenders. A brief look around confirmed that there were many more women like that in the club and I really started to freak out now as I knew my mind was playing tricks upon me. I managed to fob her off by saying I had work the next day and needed to get home so I collected my bag and left the club.Getting back home was a problem since I could quote my address but didn’t actually know where that was. I just completely followed my instincts to get me back home which luckily they did. At one point I had to cross a road and just as I thought that a car went past. I stood for ten minutes looking up and down the road trying to make sure it was safe for me to cross as I knew I was impaired but I did this directly outside the police station looking a bit worse for the wear. Luckily no officers stopped to enquire into my state of health so I managed to continue to make it home.On my way home I got a big shock, my next door neighbours were leaving for the club just as I was getting home, it was about 3 am by this point maybe, though I have no idea what the time really was. There was a taxi waiting outside my door which I completely ignored, I was pleased to arrive home for I felt that being on my own where I felt safe would help me get out of this bad trip and put me in a position where I was able to look after myself once again. As I took out my key to open the door it suddenly opened and there stood one of my neighbours and my head literally cracked and broke on the spot. The stress and shock of it pushed me completely over the edge, I wasn’t sure whether these people were real or not or if they were trying to harm me. I quickly became really aggressively defensive and got unjustifiably upset that they offered to let me get a taxi ride down to the club with them because in my head they were trying to defeat me from returning home and take me back to hell. I felt really bad about quickly making an excuse to run away though I have the firm belief it was the right decision.Finally getting home I started to experience really powerful visuals, I once again encountered the fractal mind but this time it would explode off into infinity but I was still able to comprehend all of it at once. I realized that what I was seeing was some sort of mystic force and as it grew and grew I slowly came to understand what the universe was all about, I had found the answer to life, the universe and everything. Then in a moment it was gone and I knew I had lost the greatest secret that had been hidden from mankind. I had to curl up into a ball and repeated the acid mantra, I have taken a powerful hallucinogenic and it will go away, for about half an hour. My stomach had fierce cramps, I felt sick and my mind was fragmenting into bits and I was utterly loosing my sense of self. I didn’t know if I wanted to piss or shit or drink water and for the first time I truly felt helpless and unable to look after myself. For a short period of time I convinced myself I was dying, I had always taken a risk doing drugs and finally the odds were to be against me. I was almost in tears as I didn’t want to die and I thought how upset my family and flat mates would be at me throwing my life away.However acid is a very safe drug to take and it did become less and intense and more and more pleasant. I entered a state in which everything was extremely funny and I could not stop laughing. A lettuce in my fridge had me rolling about on the floor laughing at it. After this I kinda did what I normally did but with extreme hilarity. I made many posts to GBS with complete random rantings about nonsensical things for a while. Once I entered this state I was on top of the world again, the bad paranoia trip had gone and I felt much better in the body and the mind. I spent the rest of that night entertaining myself doing things because I wanted to see what they would be like on acid to see how they were different. One of the things I noticed was that drinking/eating took up a lot of concentration as my perception of myself was very poor, at one point I went to take a drink of water and ended up spilling some on my shoulder even though I could feel the bottle neck about my lips. Eating went over the shoulder as well, there was a definite shift in my perceptions which said to me I was about one inch to far to the right in reality.After this phase my trip started to fizzle out, bass line reality smoothly started to come back to me and things would loose a certain edge that they possessed. More and more I felt fuzzy and warm and as though I was just phasing out, bits of my body would start to come back to me after feeling like I had forgotten about them for a few hours. I was still tripping under the acid just not as hard though, I was more able to place my sense of self in an environment and deal with it. I took the decision to go to work half an hour early which obviously was a bad move though at the time it made perfect sense, I had to see how other people would react to me. How much could I get away with and would people care? I found a bottle of alcohol in my bag as I left to go to work and I decided to drink that on the way to work, sitting at the back seat on the bus getting hammered. I did a full eight hours shift which included such activities as telling one of my work colleagues that if he turned off my loud techno I was going home as it was the only thing keeping me at work through to getting in a bottle of vodka and coke during my lunch break and proceeding to get completely wrecked until the end of my shift.By the time I got home I was completely hammered but had one last task to do before I could freely feel safe getting some sleep. I went to my next door neighbours to apologize for my actions the previous night, I explained the whole thing as me having way too much acid and getting a bit out of control and he was cool with it. We had a smoke then I fell into bed and passed out for a few hours.Exp Year: 2002ExpID: 18714Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Aug 5, 2005Views: 27,324    LSD (2) : Festival / Lg.

My friends, Nic and Cat, were extremely lucky to get the flat they did. It's a basement flat and an old deaf lady lives above them so she doesn't hear the noise. Even the noise of approximately 40 people partying hard with the decks at full volume.I arrived at whatever time I arrived. I'm guessing that this was about half seven pm on the Saturday. I was one of the first to arrive, and indeed arrived before the hard-core drugs did, and before the music. So, smoking hash commences. So far it's not that jumpin a party, but then our guy arrives with some speed, pills, and for some reason a bottle of acid. I'm not sure why he thought the liquid acid would be any good at a party with forty people. Maybe he just happened to have it on him.Anyway, I bought a gram of speed and three pills. I took two pills and had a few lines of base while I was waiting to come up. The speed was great, and the pills were fine. I'm used to doing speed and pills; I do them on a semi-regularly basis just for a bit of fun. Everyone was having a fantastic time, the people who were wasted and the people who were straight (most of them were working the next day). There were people fire dancing, which just looks so amazing when you're on pretty much any drug, and still looks cool when you're not.I persuaded one of my friends to let me have a go of his pois (that's fire on chains). It's one of the most fun things to do while off your face. I'd recommend it to anyone, although you should definitely have several people watching you so that if you set your clothes on fire, someone notices for you, because you won't on you own! We have great photos of one of my friends totally covered in black slimy soot from the paraffin, but I digress.The bathroom was one of the quiet rooms of the house. It's a really big bathroom with lots of floor space, and lots of fucked people, for some reason, just began to congregate there. I believe it may have started off just being the bath. I have vagueish memories of sitting in the bath with other people. We talked, we occasionally danced, we smoked hash, and we were all having a great time. There were a few people (there always are at big parties) who were a lot more fucked than everyone else. One girl was wandering about in a daze for most of the night, speeding off her face. There was a guy there who ended up spending almost the entire night unconscious on the sofa. His head bounced spasmodically from side to side. I'm sure in his head he was having a fantastic time dancing away and chatting to people, but he was in fact totally monged out all night. He only opened his eyes when the music stopped (which was rarely) and just sat there looking confused for a few moments before it started up again. Everyone kept half an eye on both these people all night, and both were fine by morning.As the night progressed, those who were drug free left for bed. The remainder then separated into two groups. In one group were those for whom it had been enough. They'd either run out of drugs or were too knackered for the drugs to be working any longer. The first group was the one that I was in. We were the hardcore party animals who had been up for the whole night and decided that it would be a good idea to go and watch the sun rise. Eventually this was agreed on and we set off for the beach. It was cold and drizzling slightly. This was not a great environment for people who have been up all night on drugs. I think some of us were feeling that much more of this would simply lead to the dreaded comedown. We climbed the fence into the ruined castle, but we couldn't find a part of the castle that was sheltered enough to skin up in, so we just headed back. The sky was much lighter, but the sun was still not yet up.We sat for a while in the living room, our remnant looking more and more depressed as the minutes passed. People skinned up and joints were created, but this was no longer enough for any of us. Then someone suggested that we all go on an acid trip. It seemed like a really good idea at the time. I'd done acid before, but only in very small amounts--enough for a mild trip, but no more--so I was eager to try it properly. Seven of us ended up taking a taxi to the house seven miles out of town where we could trip for six hours or so uninterrupted.After sitting down and smoking a spliff or two, we got down to business. The guy with the acid reckoned that two drops of the liquid acid would suffice, judging on previous experience from the same bottle. There was one other person there who had never taken a big dose of acid. We agreed to keep an eye on each other. We were all experienced drug users, and expected just to have a laugh and ignore the hideous comedowns that had set in until we could sleep them off a bit later in the day. I don't actually remember what it tasted like now, but I remember discussing it at the time.So that was it; the deed was done. All we could do now was wait. I remember wondering how long it would take. We decided that the curtains should be closed. The view outside wasn't very stunning, and the cold and the wet looked unpleasant, although the sky was starting to clear by then. I think it was about ten am on the Sunday, but I'm not entirely sure.We sat and smoked up some more, waiting, listening to music. I have no idea how long after that we actually started tripping, but I do remember sitting on the sofa looking at the ceiling, fascinated for a while before I realised that it had started. The ceiling was made of pine and was full of knotholes. I'm not sure what drew my eye up there, but I noticed that some of the dark knots had started to move around the ceiling. I pointed this out to everyone, and soon we were all there.It's amazing how quickly time passed and how far things degenerated. We spent a long time sitting and chattering amongst ourselves. My brain turned to putty and I kept saying things that I didn't mean to say. It wasn't that I didn't want to say them, it's just that my train of thought started coming out my mouth. I couldn't stop stating really obvious things like 'The sky is blue' and asking really mundane questions. It made people laugh and it was interesting to see what the LSD had done to my brain.Going to the toilet turned out to be a bit of an adventure. That sounds slightly wrong, but it really was. I'd been in the same room the whole time and hadn't even tried walking or standing. When I did get up to go after a few hours of sitting on the floor, it was like trying to walk on the moon. My depth perception was fucked, and I could watch my legs bending and stretching out and shrinking and folding. It was great! As I hadn't left the room before, I didn't know what the rest of the house was like. I was very confused. There were stairs everywhere. Some of the staircases were really narrow and long. Others were wide, but only had three or four steps. I was very confused at the time. I couldn't decide whether or not I was hallucinating all these stairs. There seemed to be a set between every single room. I later on confirmed that this was the case. The house we were in had been built upon an old ruin and started off very small with bits and pieces being added over the years. It was a fantastic house for a trip. In the toilet on the window ledge there were some ornamental shells. There appeared to be lots and lots of spider web just on that shelf and nowhere else. I couldn't tell if it was real or not, but the spiders kept me from investigating further.Back in the main room, the knots in the ceiling had turned into beetles and were running all around, but this was ok as the ceiling was where they 'belonged' and I intuitively knew that they would stay up there. I had a brief look outside the curtains, but the alien landscape outside was a bit daunting, so I decided to leave it alone. The joint-making had suddenly become very bad indeed. Everything looked wrong. All the dimensions were warped. I tried rolling some cigarettes, and that was difficult enough. It took an enormous amount of concentration. The result of five minutes' work looked extremely strange. Anything we rolled always seemed too short, but the length of the skins hadn't changed. It was a bit of a mystery. Smoking itself was great fun though. Occasionally it was hard to work out if we'd ashed the carpet by mistake or if something had fallen off the end of the spliff or roll-up, but usually after checking the carpet nothing had. Watching the smoke curl and float about was fantastic. At times it looked solid and so real, but then my perception would shift again slightly and I'd see infinitely deeply into the smoke and out the other side. It's a difficult thing to describe, but it was mesmerising.After maybe four or five hours of this, one of us received a phone call to say that their flat was being inspected. The poor guy who had been phoned had absolutely no idea what to do. We were all far too fucked to be of any help cleaning up the flat. That was our first stress. I remember looking at the clock at that point to check how long it was until the flat inspection was supposed to occur. This was almost impossible. At one point the three different hands on the clock ticked in three different directions, even though there are only two directions (clockwise and anticlockwise) possible and only one direction they were made to go in. I realised at that point that my brain was fucked enough to be creating three dimensions out of two-dimensional object. I decided that now would be my best chance ever of imagining a hyper-cube (a four-dimesional cube for those of you who don't know), or better yet--as three dimensional representations of four-dimensional cubes are almost possible, making them easier to picture--a hyper-sphere would be really really impressive. I spent about five minutes doing this. My brain boggled and came close to leaking out my ears. I decided it would be better just to leave it for another time. I kept being destracted by the stress of my fellow trippers.Our second stress, and first major problem occurred at about four o'clock. The guy to whom the house we were in belonged received a text message from his parents to say that they were coming home early (they hadn't been due back for a day) and would see him in about an hour. At this point things became really confusing for me. We managed to work out that we'd all have to leave. We also had to tidy up and leave no evidence of our being there. The problem was that we couldn't agree on where to go. I reckoned the best place would be to go back to the party flat that we'd started in. It would be safe there, and people would understand our predicament and leave us to come back down to baseline. Others believed that heading for the fields to look for magic mushrooms would be a much better idea. We eventually got the place tidied up, but it took a long time and a lot of effort. People started making toast and soup, thinking that this would help in some way. The windows were opened to let the room air, but this was confusing as the wind began blowing things around. I remember some of the observations I made at the time. One that sticks out was that we had been reduced to mob mentality. A person can be intelligent, but people are stupid. We were like people, I realised. Not just seven people. We were more like 700 all trying to do the same task. We got in each other's way, we drifted about aimlessly, and we did things that didn't need to be done. Eventually we got organised enough to think properly about leaving and where to go. I remember being really proud of our achievement at this time. I decided that we were like different facets of the same mind. We had had a goal, and we had achieved it. We'd done what we set out to do, and somehow the idea of a hive-mind seemed agreeable to me at the time. We were just deciding that it would be a good idea to get in a taxi back to town when a taxi pulled up outside. After a moment's conference we discovered that someone had already phoned one and forgotten about it completely.Just a quick note here: at the time I didn't know that we were tripping more heavily and for longer than we'd intended. It was my first time taking this much acid, so I thought that this was all going to plan, except of course the early return of parents. I was very happy up until the point that we left the house. There were stresses and problems, but they weren't my worries. I could try and help, and just tried not to think about the fact that we had to leave the house. It made me feel a bit panicky, thinking about how we were going to get the seven miles back into town in a direction I didn't know and go somewhere we hadnt' decided, so I just didn't think about it until I had to.It took us so long to get out to the taxi that he'd started to drive off, but one guy ran after it and stopped him. I have no idea what he said to convince the driver to let seven heavily-tripping people into his taxi, but it worked. I was sat in the back and the guy I was sitting next to started talking to me about stabbing a biro pen into the neck of the taxi driver to stop him telling anyone. I thought/hoped he was joking and went along with him for a bit. I couldn't tell how loud we were talking though and started to worry that the driver could hear us. We got back into town and the driver asked us where in town we wanted to go. Seven different voices stated seven different destinations. The taxi driver said that he'd just drop us off where we were so I shouted over them all and told the driver to take us to the street the party had been on. This was where the party had started, and it seemed fitting to me that it should also end there.We got out the taxi and someone paid the driver. We'd almost forgotten.We were all just heading down to the original party flat, when some of us decided that the pub would be better and our local was the safest. Apparently people were thinking that if we went back to the flat we'd get roped into cleaning up, which, in our hallucinatory state, would not have been easy. I remember asking everyone individually if they'd rather go to the pub or back to a nice flat where we could chill, and only one person actually wanted to go to the pub. However, the group mind had already decided and there seemed to be no way out of it. We walked into the pub at about half past five on the Sunday evening. Thankfully it was quiet. There were only about six people there, and I knew most of them at least vaguely. Perhaps this wouldn't be too bad after all. Some of us sat down, and some of us ordered drinks. I sat down and waited to see what would happen next. The general opinion seemed to be that we were going to have a drink here and then move on to the flat, but, of course, it really didn't work that way.We were in the pub for almost three hours. Those were the worst three hours of my life. I think that I started really coming down off the speed from the night before about then. I started getting intensely paranoid. I remember trying to interact with some of the people there, but the attempt was futile. I'd hear them say half of a sentence that made no sense before they descended into what seemed to me to be complete gibberish, not even speaking words.During those hours, I sat mulling over what course of action I should take; many thoughts crossed my mind. I considered killing everyone, or myself, or screaming at everyone to stop fucking with my mind. Words can't express that experience. I know now what a bad trip is be like, but I would still do it again. I was actally in hell for what felt like days. However, I pride myself on the fact that I didn't completely freak out. On the inside, I completely fell apart, but outwardly I was fine. I was told that my eyes were as big as saucers the whole time I was there, and my sober friends could tell that all was not well, but I didn't completely break down.My thoughts were running in circles. Random thoughts were going through my head that I had no real control over. I felt my mind fracture and splinter, and it was such an effort just to keep myself in the seat, but on the other hand, I felt that I couldn't leave everyone else because I would then be truly alone and I was scared. I was terrified that I wouldn't recover and that I'd spend the rest of my life in this living hell. I felt so small and fragile. I honestly contemplated suicide and murder, and for a while I actually did think that I was already dead and that this was hell.I don't know how bad that was, but I do know that things could have gone a lot worse. If I had lost my self control, I honestly would completely have freaked out. I had a long time to think about many things. I don't know whether or not the conclusions that I made during that time are correct or not, but I do know that I learned a lot about myself and the way my mind works. I survived.I could tell myself that this was something beyond my control, that the tripping would stop at somepoint, and that everything would be normal again. I'm not sure if it would have been better if I'd left the pub or not. I do know that I couldn't though. I had to stay with the other tripping people. I wasn't ready to face the world on my own. I became extremely insecure.I'm going to try and record some of the conclusions that I made while I was in this state. It's going to be hard to put into words though.At several points, I could feel my mind fracture and spin off in different directions. It was a bit like the clock from before. The clock whose hands went in three different directions. I had more than one train of thought running at once. It's an extremely bizarre feeling. I couldn't focus on anything for more than a few seconds...literally. I don't know how many times I asked when we were going to head back to the flat, but I think it was quite a lot.I remember feeling me trying to hide within myself, that is, my self awareness or my consciousness was retreating deeper and deeper. I think that this was some kind of defense mechanism. I was trying to get away from what I was experiencing, but I couldn't physically get out, only hide myself mentally. At the time, I thought that this might be how some patients at mental hospitals must live. It frightened me to realise just how much acid can fuck a person up.I'm giving up on trying to describe this properly. I can't even remember it clearly and I really can't find the words to convey what it was like. I've spoken to some of the people that were in the pub at the time. I wanted to find out how much they had been trying to fuck with us, and it turned out not to be that much at all. I could have sworn that half of the time I was there, people were trying to mess with our minds. That, however, was just my mind messing with me.Having experienced this though, I'd still say that acid is a really fun drug to use, but in future I'm going to treat it with a bit more respect and caution. I know that I have a tendency to rush into things without really thinking the consequences through properly, but at the same time I have an excellent capacity to look after myself.I spent over a week dazed and confused from that experience. I later learned that our dosage had been misjudged. The fact that we'd been up all night partying hard and taking other drugs was not taken into account and what was supposed to be a mild six-hour trip became a twelve hour epic adventure. This is an experience that I will never ever forget, and something that I hope I can really learn from. I know that I have already gained a lot of knowledge about myself. I know it's a bit of an acid cliche, but it's one of those cliches that you really don't appreciate until you've been through it yourself. It takes a lot of strength to face yourself on a hellish introspective acid trip-gone-wrong. It's definitely not something that I wanted to experience, but I've done it and in a way I'm glad that I have.For anyone that's taken the time to read this, sorry for the meandering aspect of this account. I have a tendency to ramble a bit. On the whole I reckon it really was a positive experience and it's definitely not put me off trying acid again in the future. I'm not really sure what that says about me as a person, but once again I don't really care. I'm happy being who I am.Exp Year: 2003ExpID: 29556Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Sep 16, 2005Views: 47,312    MDMA (3), Alcohol (61), Cannabis (1), Amphetamines (6), LSD (2) : Large Group (10+) (19), Post Trip Problems (8), Hangover / Days After (46), Nature / Outdoors (23), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), Combinations (3), General (1) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(gel tab)BODY WEIGHT:150 lbThis, the most anticipated trip of the summer, was a real let down in a lot of ways.Pre-Trip Introductions and RamblingsThe trip that was about to take place was planned perfectly, and everyone was super excited. The trippers would be myself, my girlfriend, and my old friends Kara and Jake.Kara had asked me if I could 'hook her up' with acid for about a year now, and it just so happened that I finally had a little bit to share. She had only taken LSD once before, a couple years ago, and she recalled this experience fondly so I was excited to share the experience with her once again.I had tripped with Jake before. Once, at a Phish show where he sort of wandered off, so we didn't actually trip together, and then once again just about a month ago when we ate some fantastic mushrooms and I lost my ego in the woods.  This trip had revealed a few personality traits about Jake that made me a little uncomfortable, but I had a great time nonetheless. Regardless, I invited him to trip with us to return the favor. Additionally, he had never taken LSD before, and I was excited to show him why I considered LSD the best psychedelic drug.And of course there was my girlfriend Psilosara. Some of you who frequent this forum, and inevitably end up reading some of the many trip reports I write, are probably familiar with her. She is my one love, my grounding force, and she also likes to take LSD. Why not bring her along too?Myself? Well, I'd eaten some LSD from this same batch just a couple weeks before at a friend's apartment. As I already knew, the LSD was of good quality. I'll admit my frame of mind has been out of whack lately. I haven't been spending much time at home, I've had anxiety attacks followed by deep depression, and I only have sporatic and strange forms of employment. Basically, when I hear that Modest Mouse song 'Float On', I think, 'that's what I'm doing'.And then there was my friend, who we'll call C-Slice. He was going to trip with us, but Kara decided the night before that C-Slice creeped her out, and she refused to trip with him. I had the pleasure of breaking this news to C-Slice, and apologizing on her behalf. It sort of pissed me off to have to do that, especially since the others just wanted to not tell him and instead tell him the wrong meeting time and place, or something. Fuck that shit, I thought, that's not how we do this. If we're going to give someone the boot, somebody's at least gotta tell him straight to his face. So I did that, and felt like an asshole doing it. Upon doing so, the seed of regret had been planted inside of me.The TripSo it was 12:00 noon and the four of us parked a car on the bottom of a mountain and began to walk up a steep and rocky trail to the summit, which was only about a half hour's climb, where we'd find a place to trip out. At the bottom of the trail I gave everyone two microdots, except myself. I ate an extra large mutant microdot which looked like it was two normal microdots fused together.We climbed this trail, and it was really hot out so we were all drenched in sweat by the time we reached the top. The actual top of the hill was a good couple hundred feet off the trail, so we decided we'd claim the top of the hill for our own, as it should prove to be a secluded and scenic location.Sitting around, over the next couple of hours I observed my friends display the early signs of a trip setting in. A little bit of extra laughter here, a little bit of extra attention paid to a bit of moss there, and some muscle twitches over there. Of course I was already feeling the complex tryptamine surging through me. My hands were shaking a bit more than usual and I could feel the energy surging through my arms. My stomach had tightened just a bit, but nothing uncomfortable or really distracting.Jake had brought a guitar up with him, and we took turns playing it as our trips set in. About two hours after dropping, I noticed some visuals like rocks breathing and patterns forming in the nature around us. Jake and Kara seemed a bit impatient, but I assured them there was another two hours to peak. This particular LSD seems to hit people a little later than a blotter does, most likely because of its microdot form. I dunno, it just does. So we walked around and explored our surroundings, talked about weird subject matter, and enjoyed stretching and feeling the wind blowing over the hill.Fast forward three hours, and we are all peaking. At this point I feel like I need a change of scenery, and suggest going for a walk. I know the trails around this area well, and I know there are some particularly nice areas only a few minutes away. Why not explore rather than sitting in the same place for the entire day?It was not just this particular spot that was getting to me. It was Jake. I thought I could barely stand to listen to him brag about how much ganja he sells one more time. 'It's not about the money.' Yeah, riiiight. Furthermore, I was tried of listening to him dominate the conversation by constantly changing the topic to something which allowed him to show off how well traveled he is and what a deep thinker he considers himself.Furthermore, whenever I couldn't give a shit about what he was talking about, and spent a few moments looking around at nature or thinking to myself, he would direct his conversation at me. Of course I wouldn't know what he was talking about because I stopped listening, and then he would say something like, 'BD is zoning out again,' or 'It's okay, just go back into your own little world.' Then he would look to Kara and my own girlfriend of almost four years for some sort of reinforcement for this condescending behavior.Normally I would have said, 'My own little world? What the fuck are you talking about kid... my own little world doesn't revolve around listening to your verbal masturbation. That's right, poking this rock with this stick is exponentially more interesting than you. Put your fucking shirt back on and get over yourself.'But as many of you know, tension on LSD must be avoided at all costs. Especially at the peak of a trip, and with nowhere to go besides this hill top for the next several hours. So, feeling absolutely no need to explain myself, I said nothing. While there was a thunderhead slowly gathering humidity inside my brain, I remained neutral in outward appearance.Psilosara was rocking back and forth in her camp seat, and I wondered what she was thinking and experiencing. I could feel the tension oozing out of her, but I didn't ask her for three reasons. First, I no longer felt like I was in the company of trusted friends, and any conversation I was to have with her, I wanted to be private. Second, I am always very respectful of people's rights not to reveal their thoughts, especially in front of other people, until they are ready to do so. I wish people would extend me this courtesy more often. Third, every time I looked at her or tried to start conversation, she was focused on the shirtless wonder boy. I thought it was strange that I could hardly make eye contact with her without her eyes darting towards this source of constant annoyance.Anyway, Jake decided to roll a spliff (weed/tobacco), and I felt it was late enough in the trip for me to smoke. I took probably 8 or 10 drags from the spliff, and instantly my trip went from a high ++ to a +++.And instantly my heartrate shot up from slightly elevated, as is normal under the influence of LSD, to VERY elevated and beating extra hard. I became hypersensitive to all my physical functions and it made me very anxious. FUCK. I've been here before. And now I'm back here again. I did this shit to myself and now I have to deal with a hyperactive heart for the next hour... two... three? I'm seriously amazed my heart puts up with this shit.No, I didn't think I would die or have a heart attack. I've had a few panic attacks on weed, and one particularly nasty one on weed + DXM, where I did think I was going to have a heart attack. Apparently my heart can take it, but there's no way to calm yourself down when your heart is beating way faster and harder than normal. Of course the buzz focused itself into my left arm where it took on the feeling of a numb left arm. I'm no stranger to such psychosomaticism. I willed the buzz to focus in my right arm, and then move up to my mind. I've trained myself to do this.Then I lay back and crossed my arms over my chest. This is to prevent confusion between my actual heart rate and the frequency of the tryptamine buzz, which is a bit faster than my actual heart rate and can be confused for a heart rate if I am not monitoring it. Maybe you think if I just ignore it, I'll calm down and it will slow down. No. However I can slow it down somewhat by focusing on the beats and gradually imagining that my heart is beating slower than it actually is.During this time I couldn't have cared less about what was going on around me, except for Psilosara sitting to my left. She knew what was happening and put her hand on my chest for a moment, and as she did my heart calmed down to a level I could cope with.But like I said my trip had elevated significantly since I smoked the spliff. I stared up at the trees and saw that each one was glowing brightly against the sky. The clouds were constantly shifting and changing shapes. The trees, however, were taunting me. I wanted to stop looking at trees, I was sick of all these damn trees, but no matter where I looked there were trees. I tried closing my eyes but the CEVs were not pleasing to look at. So I stared at the trees and made the entire forest turn into a fractal pattern. Well, that's cool, I guess.Then I heard Jake mention something about me being in my own world, zoning out looking at the tree tops. I harnessed my negative energy and directed it in a beam right at him. 'I want you to feel what I am feeling!'Right after that, to my great satisfaction, he appeared to be struck by the intensity of the trip. He laid back and stared at the tree tops himself. Up until this point I felt he had showed little appreciation for the LSD which I had worked hard to obtain for him, saying things like, 'I tripping, I guess.' and complaining about the lack of visuals right after being convinced that a stick in the dirt was a snake about to attack him, and also right after mentioning that the whole world looks like its being seen through a trippy filter.Stuff like that really makes me want to keep my stash to myself. (not that I have a stash anymore)After a while of intense thoughts, including some messed up thought loops which I managed to wrestle my way out of, I was ready to move around and get up. My heartrate was still very elevated but not any more than if I had just smoked a bunch of pot. So we began playing a mobile frisbee game. See, most of our throws were pretty good but pretty often we'd ricochet off a tree or throw it in the totally wrong direction, so the frisbee would land away from us. Then we'd just move our game to where the frisbee landed, and so on. This went on for some time, until our game ended up moving too far down the hill and we were attacked by deer flies and mosquitoes. We realized that we were pretty much trapped on the top of our hill, as the bugs were really starting to come out.What is there to say about the rest of the trip? Coming down was a long, drawn out process. We were stuck up on the hilltop until almost 10:00pm because we didn't want to return to civilization (or anybody's house while their parents were still around, as we weren't near anyone's apartment at the time).So we made a fire and fed it for quite some time, sitting around with little left to say and nothing left to do. At one point I asked Psilosara if she wanted to join me for a walk, hoping we could discuss things in private and enjoy a change of setting. She refused, saying that she didn't want to split up the group. I jokingly said, 'What, these kids?'... but I was dead serious. I saw no reason to give them any consideration. If Psilosara wasn't there I would have gone for a walk myself, and probably not come back.Eventually though, it was time to head back. Our original plan, which I was fond of, was to walk back down though the woods to Psilosara's house which was directly off the same trail which took us to the top of the hill, but on the other side of the hill.So we turned on our headlamps and went down what I thought was the same way we came up, but somehow didn't run into the trail. But since I know the geography of this wooded area pretty well, I just started wandering back and forth systematically back in the direction we had missed the trail. Jake continued to piss me off by constantly questioning my navigation, and suggested we go down the hill in the completely wrong way, away from any trails at all, and tried to rally support for this, the completely wrong direction. This pissed me off because I wasn't in the mood for getting totally lost in the woods far away from any trails or roads. Fortunately Kara agreed that we should keep heading back in the direction that I was taking us. So we walked this way, but Jake jumped ahead and led us, found the trail (of course), and took credit for saving us from being lost in the woods.Then we went to Wendy's drive through and ate chicken.What did I learn from this?1. Be more selective when choosing who to trip with. No more going into trips 'for other people'. Often when I trip with others my intent is for their delight, not my own. No more of that.2. The woods do not nescessarily provide endless entertainment for a tripper.3. People who obviously trip face and then complain about the quality/potency of the drugs can suck it.Exp Year: 2004ExpID: 46850Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 8, 2005Views: 35,116    Cannabis (1), LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Guides / Sitters (39), Nature / Outdoors (23), Glowing Experiences (4), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), Combinations (3), General (1) DOSE:  oralLSD(liquid)BODY WEIGHT:63.5 kgA while ago, I got a small vial of liquid acid, to try for the first time.  Although experienced with Ecstasy, Mushrooms, Weed and coke, I have always wanted to try acid.The first time I tried this particular batch, myself and two friends  took one drop each.  It came on in about 20 minutes, with peak experience after about 7 hours.  The total trip lasted for about twelve hours.  This was a fine trip, and apart from a very 'chemically' come-down the next day, there were no side effects.A few weeks later, my friends and I (now including my girlfriend) went clubbing, and took some E.  The pills were duds, and we went back to a friends house to sleep for a couple of hours.  Because we felt 'cheated' by the dud pills, we decided to drop some acid that night. We got back to my house, and looked at the vial.  There were only two drops in it, so my two mates took those, and I put some water into the vial, shook it up, and my girl and I had a squirt each. It came on quite quickly, and we were all tripping within 40 minutes.We were watching some trippy graphics on a screen, and they looked 3d to me and my two mates, but my girlfriend said that they were splilling out onto the floor... I should have noticed at this point, that she was tripping more than us, but I was tripping too, and thought nothing of it.After about 1hr, we put on some music, and my two friends went to our grow room to trip off the plants (highly reccommended, by the way).  My girl and I were downstairs talking about the universe and wormholes, and I put forward the thought that we might be caught in a time-loop, and everything was repeating itself...  after a while this became true, and our conversation seemed to be going in circles (I thought this was hilarious, and remembered we had taken the acid, so it was ok).  I left the room briefly to call down my friends, as they were missing some great music. When I came back into the living room (about 2 hours in...) my girlfriend started the same conversation we had been having before I left, but she seemed to be more adamant about it, seemed to believe it.  I thought she was just playing with our heads, but as time went on, she started getting worked up about the things that we had been talking about (eating oranges, smoking spliffs, and being stuck in the centre of the universe, and how we had to join hands to break out!).  I kept reassuring her that what she was saying was not happening.  She would then say 'Oh, yeah yeah yeah.  OOOOOKKKKK.  So who is smoking the spliff?'  It was as if the last few sentences we had said to each other had gotten stuck in her brain, and all she could say or think about was these things.I tried to roll up a joint, thinking that this would calm her, but she started to grab at me and the other people, trying to get us to join hands and 'break the loop'.Now I was worried.  Nothing I could say would get through to the real her... It seemed like she had gone to sleep, and left a recording of herself in charge of her body.I decided that a change of environment may help, so I got her to my bedroom (practically had to drag her out of the living room) and tried to talk her down.Unfortunately, at this point, she got quite worked up, and started screaming at me, for our friends, and hitting out at people. This was killing me.  The love of my life was thrashing around on the floor, and I had to put my hand over her mouth (making sure she could breath through her nose) to stifle the screaming.At this point, the police showed up, and my two friends (still tripping) had to go down and explain to the them that she was having a nightmare! By now I had managed to figure out what was going on, because I had done lots of reading about acid.  I remembered that it is not physically toxic, and I had heard about other peoples bad trips like this.  I knew she would not die, but was worried about her mind.  About 4 hrs in, I finally was able communicate with her.  She would say one of her 'loop thoughts', and I would try and reassure her by saying an appropriate response.  For example, she would say 'Oh God, where is C and V?'  And I would say 'Oh look, here they come.  They are here'.  I had to convince here that what she wanted to happen, was happening.  It became clearer to me that she was still in there by looking at her eyes.  When she was in her own world, her pupils were so large, nearly all black.  But every so often, when I got through to her, they would close to a point, and I could tell she could see me, then she would lose it, and the pupils would dilate again. The only way I could get her actual conciousness to surface, was to trick her mind.  She kept on with the 'loop thoughts', but every so often I would throw in a new response, referring to our real lives.  for example, I  at one point I asked her what she thought of the music at the club the other night, and she replied 'Oh, it was quite good', and I said 'I thought it was shit', and then she would go back into the loop.  She kept scratching at my arms, and putting her hands in my mouth (she said afterwards, that this was to try and communicate with me by 'putting her thoughts into my mouth!')During all of this, I was still tripping, and the thought of her having permanent damage was giving me suicidal thoughts.  I imagined having to explain to her father and brother about how I had given their daughter, my light and soul, a overdose of LSD and permanently damaged her.  I just wanted to take care of her, no matter if she was going to be damaged for life.  But if she died, I wanted to die too.  I had thoughts about death constantly, while trying to look after her.  Although I knew we could not die physically from this, the tripping made me think lots of fucked-up thoughts, and I had to cope with that as well as taking care of my girl.   This was the worst time of my life....EVER!About eight hours in, she began to calm down, although she was still thinking in loops occasionally. When she did come back, she felt so bad, she was convinced that she was going to die, for about 2 hours.  I knew that this was not going to be the case, but I had to keep on reassuring her, because she would believe me for a second, and then think that she was going to die again. After about 11 hours after taking the acid, she was down (but still mildy tripping visually).  she had no idea about what had happened, and we both cried and comforted each other for many hours.  From her point of view, she had resigned to dying, there in my bedroom, and this had had a huge emotional impact on her. From my point of view, I had watched the one I love most in the world, nearly dying (mentally), and since I was tripping, this had had a huge impact on my psyche.  All the fucked-up thoughts about having to explain to her family and all that, will stay with me forever.I am writing this, in the hope that other trippers will read it, and if they are with someone that gets stuck in a bad trip in the form of a though 'loop', will know how to talk them down. Reassure them, that whatever their delusions are, they are happening (if good, safe ones), or not happening (if they are bad). My girls thoughts were mainly about oranges (as we had been eating them at the start of the trip).  She would shout 'we must eat the orange... who is eating the orange?'  and I would say 'Its OK sweetheart, I am eating the orange now (chomp chomp, munch munch).'  She would then sigh in relief, before coming out with another thought, or maybe the same one again.I just kept talking to her, trying to say things to 'trick' her mind back to reality, refer to events in life, outside of the trip.  I looked at her eyes to see when the mind had surfaced, and try to get through to it before it went back down under.Above all, I gave love and hugs to her, because she was in a bad place, and only I could help her back out.The experience, although horrendous, has strengthened our bond as soulmates.  My girlfriend looks at each day like a blessing (as she was resigned to die), and I am so glad her mind and body are back the way they are supposed to be.I used to be slightly flippant with drugs, (heavy mushroom taking and 9 pills a night), but this time the psychadelic godess gave me a slap on the wrist, and said 'Dont fuck around with drugs!'  I still smoke and take the occasional pill or shroom, but not to such excess.One final point, you may be wondering why my girlfriend tripped so hard, and we didn't, and I think that she must have gotten a much bigger squirt of Acid into her mouth, and she also had been tapping the empty bottle on her hand to get the last bits (I did not know this till afterward). This happened a few weeks ago, and my eyes tear up while writing this.  Clearly, this has affected us greatly, but it has also taught me a valuable lesson, as well as bringing me and my girl closer.Safe tripping!Exp Year: 2002ExpID: 20412Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Dec 8, 2005Views: 76,208    LSD (2) : Second Hand Report (42), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:4 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)   smokedCannabis(plant material)When I was in second or third grade, I saw a rerun of Dragnet, on Nick-at-Nite, that showed a party full of spaced-out, beatnik type kids, that wore berets and were tripping out on a wall. Though the intent of the episode was to illustrate the dangers of LSD, it only served to spark my initial intrigue with the drug, which I first began to experiment with in my mid-to-late teen years.My first few trips were rather superficial, most producing only a body high and mild visuals. I soon met my now best friend, *B*, and we hit it off.  Our first trip together was alone, and we discovered how compatible we were. We were able to communicate the indescribable through facial expressions, gestures, and one word sentences. We would sit knee to knee, starring so hard at each other that I felt our eyes might burst. Sometimes we talked; choppy fluctuant speech patterns, interweaving random thoughts or ideas into a larger and more ultimate picture of what we perceived to be 'universal truth' (I must add that none of these ideas were ever verbalized in a logically structured or philosophical manner). At other times we said nothing at all. Acid was our common frame of reference, and the environment that moved us to bond.Several years and almost two-dozen trips later, a group of us were getting together to celebrate October 29th, for no reason other than boredom. A friend knew a guy who lived out of city limits, in an area where people minded their own business, and we all decided it would be the best place to hang out. I had never met this guy, but trusted my friend. He lived in a tiny mobile home, which was crowded with band equipment and other random junk. The guy was cool, and had really great pot. *B* and I dropped our acid shortly after arriving, 4 hits each, and than sold the other two to the guy's sister, who left afterwards. *B* and I were the only ones there on anything other than weed and/or alcohol (which we didn't drink).The beginning of my trip was normal. I began to get anxious, and felt a fluttering in my stomach. I knew it was going to come on like a whirlwind when it did. We both ran out of cigarettes, and decided to go to the store. Not being familiar with the area, a guy friend came along with us. The county roads don't have many street lamps and my vision was constantly moving in and out of focus. I couldn't see a thing and wasn't really sure which direction we were headed in. This concerned me. I kept asking him if he was sure we were going the right way and he would only say, 'Does it matter?' or 'Do you care?' Anyway, we got cigarettes and got back to the trailer without incident, but our adventure had set a slightly paranoid theme in my mind. *B* and I were usually synchronized in our levels of awareness, and we both tried to click our minds into place, to dive into the trip as we always did, but with no success. I was taken off guard by this, because we used each other like a safety line, and it was at this point I began to 'lose it.'The acid was much better than I expected, and I sensed that I was going to be immersed much deeper in my trip than I had ever been before, despite my trying to contain myself. Though I only remember flashes of what happened during my peak, which I estimate lasted about two to three hours, I've been told that I was rambling like a mad person and was becoming very unstable. They relocated me to the back of the trailer which served as a bedroom. I was there for most of my peaking hours, while my friends tried to calm me down, though most of the attention only intensified what I was experiencing. During this time I became claustrophobic and thrashed about, because I was being restrained. They coaxed me into lying down, at which time I concentrated on closed-eye visuals and eventually became less belligerent.I would like to say that causing a huge scene in a stranger's house and putting my friends in a position of obligation to 'baby-sit' me was the worst part of my night, but it wasn't. After I snapped out of it, and began to realize the reality of the situation, I was sure that it was over. I wasn't really embarrassed (yet), more disoriented than anything. I came out of the back room, looking at all of my friends. I lit a cigarette, and laughed. Someone handed me a pipe, I don't remember who, but I remember that it helped break tension, almost like a gesture of consolation. I took a couple of really deep hits, and sat back on the couch. I looked at all of my friends, taking in the awkward moment. I was sure that I had ruined everyone's night and was surprised I hadn't been thrown out. Soon after this, I became aware of the fact that I was still tripping. Whether it was the weed, or that the acid hadn't played out of my system completely, I don't know. All of the sudden I felt an overwhelming force pushing into me, felt like gravity had become ten times stronger. Breathing became a voluntary function, I had to remind myself to let air in and out, or else my lungs would collapse into space along with the rest of me. I felt like I was at my own funeral. Everyone's eyes, red from drinking and smoking all night long, made them appear to be crying. I thought they were crying for me. A girlfriend of ours, *K*, noticed that I was once again 'not okay' and tried to comfort me. *K* was small and skinny, with acne and sunken eyes. Her skin looked pallid and a sick yellow. There was a desperate look in her eyes when she talked to you. When I didn't respond she became more persistent, certain that I was going to flip out again. I knew I wasn't going to, and her nagging made me uncomfortable and agitated. I just looked into her, skeptical of her intentions. A black film slithered down over her eyes and I was convinced I was dying. In the background, Bob Dylan's 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' was playing, distorted by my state. She kept telling me it was 'Okay. It's okay. Everything is okay.' I felt my heart stopping. In the back of my mind I saw myself fading out. I felt a cold stab of steel-like nothingness in the pit of my stomach, what I imagined death would feel like. Not the process of dying, but the actual state of not being. *K* was my grim reaper, and she was trying to convince me of my impending death and of it being the right action on my part. I wasn't scared by this, more angry than anything. I tried to rationalize the feelings I was having towards her, but couldn't. Finally, I stood up and told her to get the fuck away from me. She winced, hurt by what I said because in reality she was sincerely trying to make me feel better. *B* took me outside on the front porch, where we talked. I told her what happened from my perspective, then she filled me in on what I wasn't 'there' for. By this time all I wanted was to scrub myself with bleach, eat some carrots, and go to sleep. When we got inside, there were people folded into every corner and crevice, sleeping. The sun coming up shown in through the windows, allowing my to see every bit of fuzz and litter and discoloration in the trailer. Everything twitched and crawled and made weird noises. I felt the urge to clean, but could only sit and stare and rub my palms on my jeans. The inactivity was tedious. My whole body fell asleep, except for my mind. I couldn't stand looking at the room any longer. My eyes felt tired and stressed, from hours of being overworked. I felt my pupils bulging, even when my eyes were closed. When I tried to sleep (in an up right position due to lack of space) I could hear and feel every one of my bodily functions. The sounds of various liquids being processed and organs groaning. My bones felt crooked and weary. There is no way to describe how uncomfortable the room felt. Comet and a wire brush come to mind. This went on for hours, until everyone woke up, and drove *B* and I back to her house, where I had the best sleep of my life. The greatest feeling I ever felt was waking up from all of that insanity. And though it is the most horrifying thing that has ever happened to me, I'd do it again, for the sake of perspective. For those inexperienced trippers, this story may not seem very scary, but keep in mind that, while I do my best, no words can possibly communicate the magnitude of the situation or the intensity of my feelings at the time. The biggest mistake I made in this situation was not being familiar with my environment. These types of drugs must be taken in a safe place where you're not subject to accidents and where you are comfortable. Aesthetics play a major role in the overall tone of your experience. Second mistake was being with a large group of not-so-close friends. While this may not apply to every person or every trip, for the most part people would be wise to stick with those they know well and love. I had tripped around all but one of these people before, and never received any negative vibes. Which brings me to my third mistake. Do not assume anything. Every hit effects various people in different ways. Be cautious and know your supplier. Talk to others who have tried the particular batch you're considering and compare stories. The most important thing I learned is that when dealing with hallucinogenics I should definitely use them respectfully, with a right and clear mind, and in moderation. I have since quit using acid and all other synthetic properties.Exp Year: 1999ExpID: 21466Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Dec 14, 2005Views: 40,783    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Bad Trips (6) DOSE: T+ 0:002.5 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:450.5 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 1:151 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:00  smokedCannabis(dried)BODY WEIGHT:140 lbIntroductionThis is a description of my first LSD experience, in 1988.  It was the second time I tried consuming tabs of LSD, but my first real experience with the chemical, as the first time, nothing happened. It would prove to be a major turning point in my life, a test that I felt that I barely emerged from alive and human.  I certainly hadn’t ever been so close to total insanity before.BackgroundThe first time I tried LSD was when I was 17.  Either the paper was bunk or else it was an *extremely* low dosage; I ended up taking 8 hits without feeling anything. This is relevant in that it led to my liberal estimation, during my second attempt, of how much LSD was acceptable to take.Set and SettingWhen I was 18, I was in a depressing situation.  My girlfriend of one year moved to a different city for college, and I was missing her greatly.  It was the first time I’d lived away from home, and my apartment was a complete and utter pigsty.  I’m talking empty ice cream cartons left on the floor, along with slimy silverware, next to piles of shoes, dirty clothes, and some left-over lunch from three weeks ago in a bag.  I didn’t worry about the mess, since I had nearly one hundred CDs to listen to, and music was my thing. I wasn’t on any medications, although I was quite dependant on marijuana psychologically, smoking every day.  I was extremely excited about my first LSD trip, having just read Storming Heaven (evidently the information on the importance of set and setting didn’t reach me).The DrugI obtained four hits of LSD from some strangers at the park, who claimed that each tab was double-dipped. I assumed that they were just attempting to sell their product (as they say, never ask a barber if you need a haircut).  It wasn’t until later that I learned that they had most likely been telling me the truth. The tabs cost 4 dollars each.The TripI started off by taking 2 and a half hits.  After 45 minutes, little seemed to be happening, so I took another half hit.  Another 30 minutes down the road (T+1’15’’), I was only feeling slightly unusual, so I took the remaining hit.  That put, I now estimate, based on many LSD experiences in the 5 or 6 years following this trip, at least 400, possibly up to 800 micrograms of LSD into my body (though of course we all know it's impossible to tell unless you know the chemist who made it).The trip started nicely, with the voices of Crosby, Stills, and Nash sounding like angels.  I smoked a bowl and felt the acid kick in more and more. Then I made the mistake of putting on Pink Floyd’s first album – Piper at the Gates of Dawn.  It is extremely different from their later work, in that it is completely insane music, although it is depressing, just as their later stuff.  I started to get the idea that Pink Floyd had driven me mad.  My mind recorded a half-second interval of music, and started playing an approximately 4-second loop, with most of it “empty”, but that half-second filled-in each time. Every 5-10 minutes, it would record another half-second interval of music or noise, seemingly randomly, and soon it filled in the entire 4-second loop, which was playing in my head repeatedly.  From t+2 hours on, for the next 6-8 hours, time became meaningless, and so I don’t have any sense of the chronology of the trip. I got the idea that my parents had driven up (an 8-hour drive) and were looking in through the peephole in my apartment door, and that they could see me.  I felt an overwhelming feeling of disappointment that they had for me, since I had taken LSD.  I knew that they had stopped trusting me.  I then knew that if I opened the curtains, I would see, literally, all of the people in the world standing on bleachers that extended into infinity, and that all of them would be looking at me, disappointed in me. It made sense that I would be kicked out of my apartment, and would have to go live as a homeless person.  I put on my bathrobe over my clothes, in order to look the part, and picked up a teddy bear, for comfort, and wandered around my apartment for the next 6-8 hours, without the ability to focus on any one thing for more than a second.  The repeating loop was still going, at full strength.  This 6-8 hour period seemed to take more than a week to me, although even that description is inadequate.  This was the worst hell I had ever experienced in my life.  I claimed afterwards that, if I had to endure the same torture for an entire week of real time, I would prefer to die.  The directness of the experience has faded with time, but I think that I might still be of the same opinion.During this time, my roommate, who was very anti-drug, called.  I answered the phone, for some reason, and he asked me for a friend’s phone number.  I had to tell him that I’d call him back, since I couldn’t even really figure out where the number might be, or what he meant, or how to talk on the phone.  I continued my wandering, and some time later, I happened to see that friend’s number on a piece of paper.  I put it in my bathrobe pocket, thinking that it might come in handy.  Later, maybe a universe or two later, I saw a telephone in front of me, and picked it up and dialed some number. I do not know how I knew my roommate’s girlfriend’s phone number, but when my roommate answered, I simply read him the number in my pocket, and he never knew that I was located in another plane of existence, and that my tenuous grasp on his reality could have easily been lost if he had asked me any other question at all.It was music that destroyed me, and it was music that saved me.  In the midst of my wandering, I happened to pick up my guitar, and to play a few notes…each sound was like a raindrop falling and splashing, flowing musical beauty.  The sounds took me back home, somehow, and comforted me.  I began to relax, and realized that I wasn’t about to become homeless after all.  I spent the rest of that night playing guitar, and enjoying the night air.  I smoked another bowl of marijuana and felt wonderful, although I still was very much shaken from the intensity of my bad hours. Eventually, I went to sleep, but the next day I was scared to leave my apartment, for fear of not knowing how to interact with strangers.  This fear slowly diminished over three or four days.Despite my horrible trip, the ending was amazing enough that I tried LSD again on many occasions, and enjoyed almost every minute of almost every trip.  After approximately 20 trips under my belt, I quit, and switched to natural alternatives such as mushrooms and mescaline.  My bad trip has affected my life ever since – that’s more than 15 years.  It gave me strength, as I knew that since I had survived such a tremendous horror, I could survive almost anything. It also made me take less LSD after that – I never took more than 3 hits at once again, and I was more cautious in waiting for what I had already taken to kick in before taking more.  It was the bad music choice, as well as my bad emotional state and physical situation (set and setting!) that caused this bad trip. I firmly believe that keeping your focus on set and setting will help avoid the majority of problems.Everyone who is reading this, remember to thank Erowid for providing a place for free speech, as well as such valuable information, all for free.

Looking back, I made some OBVIOUSLY retarded mistakes that I've learned from.  I sound like the world's biggest amateur based on my actions, but this was not my first experience with L, and not even my first bad trip. Although the trip itself was a disaster, I've grown tremendously as a person since then, although the feeling of horror and fear I experienced that night still lingers on in my mind.It was the summer of 2003.  I was 19 yrs old and life was good.  I had recently finished my first year of college (although it ended on a terrible note with my best friend and current roommate being robbed at gunpoint and having to deal with a whole mess of legal issues -- although that is another story!) and had been soaking up the rays down at the beach while working.  I had begun a relationship with my first real girlfriend and things were going swell.Towards the end of July, me and three of my best friends from high school decided to attend a Drum and Bass/Electronica festival in the city.  I drove up from the beach solo in the middle of the afternoon and we had planned to get to the show early.  Unfortunately, when I got up to my house I realized that the tickets were locked inside!  Worse yet, I had all of my friends tickets!  I became impatient and tried to find a way into the house.  I began pushing on my basement window, trying to pry it open, while on the phone with my brother asking him if he knew if a spare key existed.  While my attention was diverted, I heard the glass shatter and saw blood dripping from my arm.  'Great!' I thought.  'Just what I need.'  I wasn't cut too badly -- about a centimeter long gash on my left forearm, but I was bleeding nonetheless.  My neighbor was outside at the time and heard the window break and he came over to investigate.  He saw me holding my tshirt over my arm and offered to clean up my wound for me.  I accepted.  He cleaned out my cut and stuck a bandage on it for me and sent me on my way.  I went back to my basement window, cleaned up the glass and crawled inside to fetch my tickets.Soon after, my friend C picked me up.  C was a very experienced drug user and I became friendly with him in high school merely by smoking pot after school.  He introduced me to MDMA and mushrooms and I had had some great times with him.  We quickly picked up our other two buddies, S and H and we embarked on our journey to the city!A huge traffic jam got us stuck on the highway for a long time, and C was growing increasingly impatient.  Around the same time, my arm was beginning to bother me and I kept on touching my bandage.  'It will be fine,' I thought to myself.  I had been anticpating this show for the longest time and I wasn't about to let a little cut stop me from going.  When we finally made it into the city, we realized that we didn't know where we were going.  We drove around in circles for a little while until we finally decided to stop and ask for directions.  We made it to the venue a little behind schedule, but still on time to catch the main act.When we got inside the venue, my friend H announced that he had scored some LSD earlier in the day and that it was a surprise he was going to give us.  We eagerly accepted his offer and each took a hit of blotter.  I remember being confused at the way it was cut -- instead of square hits, the doses were much more thin and rectangular shaped.  'No matter,' I thought.  We walked around the venue soaking up the sights and sounds (heavy, dark drum and bass music) and waited for the acid to kick in.  I remember eagerly awaiting the visuals to start, but only feeling great anticipation and a sense of nervous energy.  I remember as I was walking across the dance floor a light beam shot down and sent sparkles of star light shooting through the air.  I couldn't tell if this had actually occurred or if I had hallucinated it.  My mind remained focused on the cut on my arm.By the time the main band came onstage, the dance floor was packed and I was still feeling very uneasy and wasn't tripping in the way I had hoped.  My friend S thought we should smoke a bowl and I agreed.  I took a hit and immediately had the feeling of 'Why did I just do that?'  My thoughts began racing and everything I thought or saw took and a very dark, negative tone.  I felt as if all the other people in the audience were watching my every move, whispering to one another about how lame or stupid I looked.  I saw all my peers in the room as being evil.  My arm began throbbing and I couldn't take my mind off of it.  Here I was, standing in some disgusting club in the middle of the city with a giant, infected cut on my arm just so I could stand around in the middle of the night listening to strange drum and bass music -- was I really that dumb?  Did I really value this crappy music and these evil people over my own well being?  Why wasn't I in a hospital getting my arm taken care of?  At this point I really really wanted to leave and seek medical help because I was so distracted by my arm, but I felt trapped.  There was no way out.  I would have to stand around for a few more hours before C got tired and wanted to drive home, but even by then my arm would be infected and I would be left with a horrible scar.  I was clearly losing it.  Before I knew it, the main attraction had left the stage and we were forced to sit around listening to DJ's spin until they came back for their second set.  I sought out a couch to rest my body and mind, but this didn't help.  I was confronted with a multitude of spun out kids, each more fucked up and helpless than the next.  I remember a dirty, drug-fiending girl coming up to me and my friends and demanding money.  The other kids in the area thought it would be funny to fuck with her and tell her to look in strange places for cash, and she followed the orders desperate for some money.  Everyone was amused -- I sat there disgusted at my current situation and the people I was spending my night with.For the next few hours, every single bad thought that I could ever have came and went through my head tormenting me while the drum and bass pounded my ear drums.  I thought back to my childhood and all of the mistakes I had made.  I thought of my family and how they had let me down and how I had let them down.  I thought of school and all of the shit that had went down before I had left and how I didn't want to go back.  I thought of the world and the wars and the violence and all the pollution.  What was the point of all this!?  I was wasting my time doing nothing while the world was slowly being poisoned by its inhabitants.  My arm was going numb by this point -- I wasnt sure if I was in serious medical danger or if it was just thea acid fucking with my head.  I had sacrificed my health and relationships just to come see a concert.  What the hell was I doing with my life!?  I had never felt so insignificant in my entire life.  I felt like a giant failure and my thoughts were overrun with a ominous feeling of uncertainty and fear.  I was being crushed by the weight of the world.  I was fighting off tears at one point.  My brain had been poisoned, and I felt that there was no way I could possibly come down.  I was literally going insane.  I just wanted this to end.  I wanted to hug my family and tell them I was sorry for everything.By the time the show finally ended, it was near 4am.  I left the venue extremely frightened and confused about what I was going to do in the future.  My arm was still bothering me a lot.  I sat in the car in dead silence for the entire ride home, my brain still racing with evil thoughts.When I got back to my house, I was in no condition to sleep.  I decided that I needed to go to the hospital to get my wound fixed up.  It was 5am at this point, and my friend H agreed to drive me.  (H and I had been friends since Kindergarten, but it wasnt until this night that I realized how wonderful of a person he really is.)  We sat in the waiting room for what seemed like an eternity.  By the time the doctor had come to see me, it had been over 12 hrs since I had first cut myself.  He looked confused at my reasoning for not coming to see him earlier.  I still felt terrible, and I thought he was judging me as a drug addict loser who was wasting his time.  He fixed up my cut though, and I began to feel a little better.I went home and tried to get some sleep.  No luck whatsoever.  I sat in my bed and listened to music, music that I normally loved and would dance and sing around to, but it just seemed so sour and evil that I began crying.  What had I done to myself?I sat in my bed for a few hours thinking of a list of things that I had to tell somebody.  There was so much on my mind that I just needed to communicate to someone.  If I didn't talk to someone, I would surely drive myself insane.  All of my thoughts seemed to be trapped on my tongue and sealed in my head and I was scared that if I didn't get them out into the open they would dissipate back into my soul and torment me forever.  I had completely hit rock bottom and I had no idea what to do.  I felt like I would be stuck in this hole of darkness forever.I decided to call my Dad.  I had always loved my Dad but had been growing more and more distant in the past few years.  I saw the path our relationship was going down and it made me sick.  I called him at his office and asked him if he could home b/c I really needed to talk to him.  He seemed confused and nervous but agreed to come home for lunch.  When he came home and we sat down to talk, he immediately assumed that I had been arrested for drugs and he seemed pissed.  However, I tried to begin telling him all of the things that were on my mind but found myself unable to speak and I broke down and began sobbing.  I vividly remember hugging him and at that moment feeling that everything was okay again.  I eventually calmed down and had a very long talk about everything that was on my mind.  He completely understood and was very grateful that I had come to him with my problems.  The healing had begun!I was very fragile for the next few days, but as I returned to my normal self I learned to value things that I had previously overlooked.  My family and friends in particular.  I saw them as a tremendous source of support and comfort in an otherwise cold, unforgiving, and brutal world.  I wanted to tell them how much I loved every last one of them.  I've also stopped paying any attention to the future, because it only makes one worry needlessly.  Peace can be found in the present moment through acceptance of what is and by recognizing the amazing beauty that is constantly flowing through everyone and everything in the universe.I took acid again a few weeks later and had the most beautiful and spiritual experience of my life.  I'm beginning to think that this horrible experience I just recounted was a result of many different factors including: the cut on my arm, bad acid, cramped indoor venue, the intensity of the music, and the confusion that was surrounding my life in general at the time.  Since then, I have drastically cut down on my usage of psychedelic substances, especially pot.  My head has never felt clearer, but I am not opposed to them altogether.  I can still sense the psychedelic qualities of everything I see and do, but am hesitant to throw myself into that world again out of fear that I will have another bad trip.  I believe that when I am ready, the experience will find me.  I just have to be open and accepting.Exp Year: 2003ExpID: 32403Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Apr 14, 2006Views: 40,387    Cannabis (1), LSD (2) : Large Group (10+) (19), Families (41), Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3) DOSE:3 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:125 lbI should preface this, because it’s kind of yanked out of context, considering it was a blog entry written in the days immediately following the trip and previous blog entries help outline the prior situation. Basically I had gotten back to university after Christmas break and had done rather badly in some of my courses. Not from any trouble I had in my courses, but because I lacked the iniative and effort to do anything towards the end, despite my excellent start back in September and October. This was driving me mad, because I realize that I'm a fairly intelligent person, and the fact I didn't work hard was eating me up. All week I had terrible anxiety, and me, a person who never stresses over anything, getting anxiety. I couldn't sleep, I felt ill all week and my appetite was gone, beyond what cafeteria food usually does to it. However I was given a second chance in one of the courses, and the end of the week saw a recovery of my former spirits, particularly since an old friend R----n came to spend the weekend with us, and he was in a really good mood to have escaped M---u for a few days and R----n's moods are always really contagious, so I caught some and cheered up. So I figured that I would be in a good mindset for the impending trip.Silly me for failing to put two and two together. Bad weeks make for bad trips, although it seems that almost everyone had a nasty time Saturday night. So nasty in fact that we were sitting in the hospital Sunday morning, which is always the worst way to end a trip. In fact I think this will be last trip for a very long time. That stage in my life where I was interested in lsd to the point of doing it on a semi-regular basis seems to have come to an end. Not that a bad trip scared me off it, but it really made me think about myself and improving upon my slackness and my lack of assertiveness. Tripping just becomes a needless exercise in intellectual masturbation and in a way, ego stroking. I really don't need that.Well, now its time for the story about the trip, perhaps the part that people find most amusing. Well originally I was going to trip on January 11th (Albert Hoffman’s 100th birthday) which due to my bad math (I'm an arts student!) I thought was Monday, but was actually a Wednesday. Wednesday would never work because it is a full day of classes, whereas Monday classes were over by 11:30am leaving all afternoon. I realized my dates were wrong on Saturday, so I decided to trip that day along with O--e, L----n, P--l, I---c and A--m who were all tripping Saturday anyways. I---c and A--m were first timers at tripping so we had resolved to show them a good time. They all dropped around 3:30pm while I stayed sober to guide them into the first part of their trip and I was waiting for P--e to get back, since he wanted to trip. P--e arrived in around 4:30 but we decided to wait a little longer so I could keep watch over those five. At 5:30, just as the cafeteria opened, P--e and I dropped. Both he and I took three hits which was the most either of us had taken and in retrospect, this different batch was stronger than we were expecting. I went down for supper since I needed something on my stomach for the night, but I was hoping all the way that the acid would hold off long enough that I could eat supper and talk without hallucinating. I've had times when I was full out tripping in under half an hour, but after half an hour I was only feeling a bit loopy. So I headed back to my room where the rest of the trippers were.Everyone was having a good time, enjoying how the drug was playing with their perceptions, except for L---n who was feeling rather ill. Soon I was feeling really nauseous too. There is slight amount of nausea involved at the beginning of the trip, but this was ridiculous, I felt like I was really going to vomit. It might have been the people smoking in the room, since I felt better sitting in the hallway where the air was cooler and clearer. I went back in and P--e and P--l were watching a documentary I had gotten for Christmas, called 'World War One in Colour.' We got to see the trenches in blazing colour, all that brown mud and blue sky. The acid made watching it absolutely amazing, the historical figures and events coming totally alive for us in our imaginations. However, watching that documentary was a mistake since it set the whole trip in a sombre mood, when we should have had a much more whimsical setting. Plus we didn't make much use of music, which is extremely powerful at setting an atmosphere. Instead we let P--l play war games on my computer. Every time I walked into my room I could here shouts in guttural German and bursts of machine gun fire. No mellow Beatles. Well we tired of things in my room and decided to go for a walk. P--e, O--e, L----n, P--l and I with C----y as our trip-sitter went down to the train tracks near the bottom of C----g Road. Of course before we left we had noticed that I---c and A--m had disappeared, but I was not terribly concerned because they had not taken much. We arrived down on the tracks and admired the graffiti melting but the huge chunks of ice were far more interesting. I could watch all the crystals morph into strange geometric fractal patterns. We walked southward down the tracks for about 10 minutes until we reached the next overpass. Along the way (the tracks are canyon dug into solid rock) we looked at the ice formations on the rock face. When we arrived at the overpass we were starting to get some bad vibes. At first I'd thought we'd met up with some other sketchy looking people down there, but that was just my perception playing tricks on me. However we started to feel panicky because we didn't feel familiar with the area. L----n was feeling particularly upset about where we were, so we all decided to head back. C----y was with us, but said little to reassure us so we forgot that he wasn't tripping with us. I felt much better when I got back up on C----g Road, although the light traffic seemed almost threatening to my state of mind. It was around 8pm when we got back to the room. It was at this point the trip started to get horrendous for me. The three hits were peaking at this point and I was tripping way harder than I wanted to be.Back in the room, my mind felt like it was drowning in this bizarre world. Normally, lsd at smaller doses gives me a distant sense of reality, but reality was gone entirely now. The room seemed like it was entirely a bizarre construction of mind. The other problem was that everyone else was nearly as loopy as me, since C----y had left us and we were tripping off each other. We couldn't figure out what time it was or how long we had been tripping. Basically the consensus was that we had lost something, but we didn't know what it that was making us panic. My mind was no where near the coherent state it is usually and I felt like I was falling farther into the trip with no bottom in sight. The visuals were absolutely insane, with objects morphing into other objects and the like. My vision was nearly entirely fractals at some points. The best way to describe it was as if someone had gotten the world wet and the ink ran.  I became very restless because my mind was so incoherent. I wandered from bed to bed in the room, lying down and crawling into a foetal position in some attempt to make it stop. The trip was making every moment of existence complete and utter hell. I wanted to stop existing immediately in order to make it stop. I am not someone who has suicidal thoughts, so the back of mind reminded me that death was not something I truly desired. I realized why I wanted to hang on to existence so much, because existence is certainty, hell as it was; non-existence being not in my experience (since I've done nothing but exist) was an uncertainty. I lay down with the hope that I could pass out to stop this consciousness, but I hung on to my pillow for dear life. My head was on my side and all I could see was my hand spread out next to it and I watched it, as the skin's pattern seemed to flow, the hair marching up and down my arm. My mind began to break the universe down into its base of energy and matter, space and time.All I knew about mathematics and physics seemed to make sense at the time, the universe didn't seem to be any sort of a puzzle. I could see the whole thing spread out before me but it was so abstract I can't really put it into words at this point. I looked up and the posters on my wall seemed fully alive. The figures in them were moving around just like the magical pictures in Harry Potter do. By this point C----y and R----n had come back and realized that I was acting totally out of my mind. I found this attention on my situation to be very upsetting and I kept trying to respond to their inquiries if I was all right in some coherent manner, to allay their fears, because I would have rathered face it alone rather than concern them. Of course I failed miserably at being coherent, but the really interesting thing was that I could say something and immediately perceive exactly what they perceived me to mean by what I said, even if I meant something different. I felt able to read their thoughts to a great extent. Of course besides the extra sensory perception, I had voices in my head talking to me about seemingly every subject, from philosophy to dinner. I felt like I was truly out of my mind, and I knew at the time most of these symptoms (including the visuals) were very close to those of schizophrenia. I started to fear about being in this hellish state forever and having the consequences like my parents coming and me having to drop out of university appear. When I am on any sort of psychedelic substance, the idea of bad consequences is a truly terrifying one. I went back to lay on my bed and started to talk to my self, not like having a conversation, but talking to myself as a form reassurance. I kept repeating the phrase 'this is such a bad trip' out loud as well as the word 'time' and other things like 'oh my god' and the amount I took and at what time. I kept repeating 'time' because I vaguely realized that if I had to fight this drug, I had time on my side and I would win out in the end. However, this really concerned them and R----n came into my room alone and lay next to me in an attempt to talk to me. He was drunk and so couldn't understand in what state of mind I was currently in, but somehow convinced me I needed a shower (which is better for curing being drunk). When in the state of mind I was in, it was easier to go take the shower (with much coaxing) than argue why I didn't need it. I stood in the shower talking to myself, hot water running off me (I remembered to take my clothes off though) tripping out really badly as the shower tiles rearranged themselves based on their mood(shower tiles have moods?). I could hear everyone talking about me in the room, but I'm pretty sure I can't hear through that wall while I'm sober. Or else I was imagining it. I came out and ran into a rather drunk N--k who noticed that I was out of my skull and wanted to know what was wrong to which I replied, 'nothing, it's just a bad trip.' Of course with a bad trip, nothing in particular is wrong, just that everything is wrong.The shower helped, because I started coming down a bit after. The water felt real, and reality felt good being so out of it. When I got back into the room, I---c and A--m were back. Apparently they had just gone back to their residence to play video games, but we panicked a bit since we thought we had lost them. I was still tripping hard, but some mental coherency had returned and the panic had subsided. I sat on my bed, clad only in underwear and a bathrobe, looking very much look a ghost I was so pale and wet. A-i (who was tripping, but not with us) and T-m came to see me and remark about how fucked I looked, A-i saying that I looked like I was at death's door. The visuals were still very powerful, but they were subsiding. I felt and some points though that I was going to slip back into the worst part of the trip. By midnight I was back in my regular state of mind, despite still obvious hallucinations. O--e and L----n headed home just after midnight, along with I---c and A--m. P--e and P--l stuck around for another hour as we talked about our trips. P--l said his was pretty good, while P--e complained that his was bland and sub-par despite taking three hits. I certainly could not complain of a sub par trip. By this point my mood had really improved and I was in a fairly whimsical mood, hugging my mental coherency like a relative at an airport now that it was back. I went to bed around 2am after classifying my trip as a level 4 psychedelic experience compared to a usual level three. I didn't sleep well, my mind was too full of thoughts and wouldn't shut off. Usually I can fall asleep rather quickly because I'm exhausted, but this time was different. I wasn't the only one though, everyone didn't sleep that night. At 7:15am the telephone roared across my near trance like state. It was O--e, and He was asking if I could come over to his residence and help calm down L----n who was schitzing out. I felt that since we all tripped together it was my duty to help everyone come down all right. I headed over, and the chill dawn air was very clearing for my thoughts. When I got there, I realized that the long spindly fingers of paranoia had gotten a hold of L----n's mind. She had 'the Fear.' Basically she was really scared that she couldn't fall asleep, and that something was wrong. She could never articulate what exactly was wrong, and what she did describe fit all the medical effects of lsd, stress and exhaustion. The problem with something like this is that it is self-reinforcing. If she believed that something was physically wrong with her, then she would feel something to that effect. She was inconsolable and wanted to go to the hospital. I really knew that they could not do anything for her, other than tell her to let it wear off and get some sleep and I didn't want the three of us ending our trip in a hospital which is the worst way to end a trip. A friend, Z--h drove us down to the hospital around 9:40am so L----n could get some professional help. Z--h and I sat in the waiting room and I found just what I wanted after an acid trip, on the magazine table. It was copy of Canadian Geographic with lots of pictures of the earth from orbit. That's exactly what I wanted to see, pretty pictures from space. Since L----n was in her pyjamas so Z--h and I had to go back to her room and find her health card while she and O--e saw a nurse. L----n's room was just a huge mess with clothes everywhere, so Z--h and I spent 20 minutes searching for her wallet in the room. I must say it was one of the messiest rooms I've ever seen. We got back, but in the end L----n didn't need the health card since the nurse told her to smoke some pot and get some rest, saying that he'd done his fair share of acid. Of course we didn't smoke any pot, but rather went right to bed, but she didn't fall asleep till late that afternoon. I went to bed at 11 am but before falling asleep I had visions of the hell of the trenches, complete with soldiers religiously crucified in the mud of No Man's Land. Rather disturbing, but I was exhausted. In fact I was fried for two days afterwards. That's the longest I've ever gone.That was a summary of my worst trip ever, in direct contrast to the best trip ever, which had taken place a month previous. As much detail as I put into this account, my words are inadequate to explain everything I thought and felt in this experience. Oddly a bad trip has done little to dissuade my interest in lsd, comparable to the one time I got alcohol poisoning and didn’t drink any alcohol for a year, and to this day drink extremely occasionally.Exp Year: 2006ExpID: 50960Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: May 28, 2006Views: 38,216    LSD (2) : Hangover / Days After (46), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:80 mgoralPharms - Fluoxetine(pill / tablet) 1.5 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab) 1 bowlsmokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:65 kgWe were planning on taking the Acid on Saturday night. I was more than excited to do it. My friend R wanted to do it with me and our boyfriends. It worked out so that we could get it for Friday night and be able to go to N's house (R’s BF) and his parents weren't going to be home for the night. I had to work until 8:30pm and they were there to pick me up as soon as I got off. At work I lazed around stoned, making sure I stayed in a good mood. The last time I did a hallucinogenic drug for the second time (Mushrooms) I had a really bad trip. I ended up taking around eight grams and thought my world was coming to an end. It was horrible, I cried for four hours straight. So anyways, I was totally stoked and so was my good friend, R. We wanted to do it together and have good talks and a sweet trip. I wanted to do it with her and was stoked I didn't have to wait another day to try out Acid and get messed up. I was sure I could handle drugs and that I'd have a really good trip. We'd go for a walk and I'd realize so much about our world and realize my beliefs and more about the person I am... But nope, we ended up not even going outside but staying in N’s house the entire night. N is one of my boyfriend's best friends and one of my friends as well. Yah, I'm sure it could have been a lot of fun if the circumstances all worked out, but they didn't. My friend R wasn't feeling the hit at all. We had taken them as soon as we got into N's house and cut them apart. N took 2, my BF took 2, I took 1.5, and R took 1. (Not only taking the one and half hits alone but I am also on anti-depressants and pills for my eating disorders; 80mg dosage a day of Fluxotine).The vibe I felt with R for some reason to me, wasn't so positive. It felt weird and she wasn't high when we all were beginning to be. We went outside to the smoke room and started smoking a bowl out of N's bong and then I went with R because she wanted someone to come with her to get her cds out of her car. When I ran outside it felt amazing and refreshing. I ran back in to get the last hits off the bong and then we grabbed some Buds from the fridge and went back into the living room. We drank beer and listened to NIN. I took my last half hit of Acid. I was loving it. I was turned-on and experiencing so many open and closed eye visuals. They were rainbow colored like the eye for Tool and they were streaking across my vision to the beat of the music when my eyes were open and they were so intricate when I shut them. They were in a kaleidoscope pattern that slowly rotated and swirled, faded and expanded. I sat on the floor away from my BF alone on one couch and R and N together on the other. I was closing my eyes and sharing with them all the things I was picturing. I began to feel like they didn't care and didn't understand what I was experiences. Whether they really did or not, that was how I was feeling. I felt like they were looking at me as if I were a freak or something. I didn't like it at all. From then on I don’t really remember details. Thinking of it now I realized it was then that I went psychotic and starting raging, crying, and loosing it. No one could help me. They couldn't convince me that it was the Acid and I was only having a bad trip. I should have listened to them right away when they said to not listen to the voices in my head that were thinking all the negative thoughts. The next three to four hours were a blur. I remember being in the living room and then in the spare bedroom feeling so mad, scared, and upset. In the bathroom I sort of came too and they could talk to me for once. They kept saying that they would tell me what I did and what had happened tomorrow. They wanted it to wear off first because I was unable to communicate with. Then I started to clue in. I pieced just enough together to realize that something bad had happened because of me that night. I had a bad trip and I ‘ruined all their nights’ so-to-speak because I scared them and frustrated them beyond the point of imagination because I kept forgetting and wouldn't listen at all. Once it hit me that I wrecked all of our nights that could have been fun and that I had SUCH high hopes for, didn't work out at all because of me, I broke down crying hysterically. I ran down the stairs into the rec room area and my BF came down after me. I kept remembering and then forgetting what I had done that was so horrible in my eyes. I was starting to slip in and out of my Acid trip on my comedown. I went back upstairs and read 1:33am on the clock in the kitchen and kept re-remembering the bad news and crying all over again. Then I started to see how bummed out everyone was because of my bad trip and having to deal with me and it made me even more upset. I started to be able to figure more about how it happened once N asked me more questions and it forced me to think. I realized that when I talked to each of them I thought that the words being said in my head were their real thoughts in their head and I could hear them. Then once I was done talking to them it felt like a wave on information like I had blinked and read their minds. My trip was full of terrible paranoid thoughts that drove me insane. It was a hard, struggling battle to finally piece it all together, but it was worth it. I cried for so long, it was a depressing and brutal awakening. I thought that they were waiting until I was sober and then bringing me to my mom to take me to a mental institution or to a doctor right away. I thought this because I had told them that the reason why I was unsustainable and freaking out was because the Acid reacted negatively with something in my personality inside my brain, chemically... or something… It didn’t even really make sense to me or to them; we were all sooo messed up. I had totally forgotten that they were just as messed up as I was. I was expecting them to be able to help me like I've had a sober person be there for me in the past. I cried so much trying to work it all out aloud with them, it was horrible. I was so messed up that they figured that the only way that they could get it through to me and tell me what happened would be by drawing it with pencil crayons and paper. Then they asked me if I wanted to draw and color... I felt soo belittled and it felt extremely condescending. That made me even angrier. I felt such a negative vibe with R all night for some reason it was so strange. I hated it. I just wanted her to have a good trip and I thought that we'd be able to become closer after it or something silly like that. Stupid reason hey, using drugs to expand a friendship... I didn't look at it that way, but that was pointed out to me after. Anyway before I go off topic some more... I washed my face and my make-up off because it ran so much while I cried and it was burning my eyes. I looked horrribbblle...I’ve always hated looking in the mirror when I’m on drugs because I never look like myself and it’s scary. R and I talked and she helped me out a lot. I felt like I could trust her and she understood what I was trying to explain. But still the terms with me and my BF weren’t the best. N was asking me questions and R was trying to help but it put me in an even worse mood. I hated what was happening. I just wanted them to understand and not look at me the way that I felt they were. I felt like they were making fun of me and laughing at me. They said that they were because it got so annoying after a while that they just sort of had to laugh it off. It was becoming too ridiculous I guess. I just needed help. I blamed the Acid for triggering my personality defect and it making me go ‘crazy’. Once I came too I slipped back in and out of it. I forgot so easily and it hurt so much to remember again. I felt like it was bad news of a death or something, that's how harsh I was taking it each time I remembered again. I had created a world of chaos and hell and I lived it out that night. I felt completely exposed to the world. I was extremely embarrassed even though they are all so close to me. I thought that the voices in my head were the actual thoughts of my friends and they were telling me harsh stuff and that it was all true. I felt embarrassed about losing it on them, and at the same time so afraid of them. I had lost my ego entirely. I was apologizing and I was scared and worried at the same time. I thought that they were going to put me in a crazy place and I wouldn't get to be with my BF anymore, of whom I love soooo much!! That was hurting me way to much. I was feeling so much pain. It was by far the worst trip ever imaginable. It beats my Mushroom trip because I had my BF there to comfort me and he wasn't as messed up as I was. I learned from my trip that no matter how experienced a person thinks they are with drugs; sometimes people just have bad trips. It happens to all of us, even the best of us. I realized that I can’t control hallucinogenic drugs very well and that I have far too many paranoid thoughts. So I think I’ll just stick to MDMA, drinking alcohol, and smoking weed for my good times!Exp Year: 2005ExpID: 41671Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 16, 2006Views: 15,645    LSD (2) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:3 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:180 lbThe year was 1991 and it was the end of summer vacation before my Senior year in high school.  A friend of mine in Santa Cruz had gotten a hold of some really potent LSD and invited me down.  So I took a bus from Berkeley to go finally go on a 'real' trip.Some background first.  My friend, four years my senior, had been by neighbor since I was one year old.  He introduced me to pot and LSD.  Years of psychotherapy later I recognize him as having basically psychologically abused me through most of my childhood.  His primary methods were physical dominance and verbal derision.Anyhow, I arrived in Santa Cruz and quickly took three tabs of 'triple dipped' flying eyeballs.  Aside from my friend there were two other roommates at the house, one a completely fried LSD lifer.  It was nighttime.Within an hour pattern hallucinations kicked in hard and I started getting really uncomfortable.  I went for a walk with my friend and my anxiety levels started shooting through the roof.  At one point I heard a nonstop stream of muttering coming from my friend saying what a loser I am, how I am a failure, on and on and on... I told him to stop it, and he acted like he didn't know what I'm talking about.  I've no idea if it was entirely a hallucination or not.We got back to his house and turned on some Bob Marley.  He laid down on his bed and I in my sleeping bag just next to it.  Immediately the music began to speak to me.  There was a giant bubble of energy in the music and we were both connected to it by beams of energy from our solar plexus.  I got really uncomfortable, this didn't make any sense to me!  I realized that the last thing I wanted to do was be in communion with my friend whom I actually detested!  Meanwhile good 'ol Bob was telling me 'I like it like this, I like it like this'.  It was too much for me to handle.  I looked over at David and he immediately looked at me, like why did I break the connection?  Then I saw him for what he really was, a giant rat person who had been feeding off of me for my entire life.  Overload!  I laid back into my sleeping back and tried to go to sleep. I felt a gigantic bubble of consciousness overtake my small bubble, it assimilated me into it and took over.  Suddenly I lost control of my body, my arms moved up across my chest and formed a cross like a mummy.  My skin dried up as I decayed thousands of years in a few seconds...  my sleeping bag became a sarcophagus.  I died.  Then suddenly I violently cringed into the fetal position.  I was in the cosmic egg, surrounded by infinite layers of rainbow colored shells radiating out from me.After this things get a bit hazy.  I vaguely remember floating around the 'ether' talking with all sorts of different beings.  I specifically remember meeting a group of people seeking the meaning of life, and some sort of guide who was with me asked me if I ever wondered what the meaning of life was.This went on for some time.  Eventually, a voice came to me and said 'don't you feel like screaming?'  'just let it out'.  And yes, I did feel like screaming...  this energy started growing in my solar plexus and I let out the loudest banshee scream humanly possible... ear shattering and throat tearing!  Once it started I couldn't stop it, I just kept screaming and screaming at the absolute top of my lungs.  Through all of this I was 99% unaware of the physical universe, I must have been so deep in my unconscious that my visual input was miniscule compared to the deep perceptions I was experiencing.Then David, my friend, came up to me and told me that if I screamed one more time he would hit me so hard.  This of course was a suggestion for me to scream again... and he clocked me square in the jaw.  Then things got really interesting... in a bad way. I fell... not just to the ground but into someone else’s body.  I found myself inhabiting the body of a filthy, homeless black man who was high on heroin stumbling through some urban wasteland.  This man walked down a street and eventually into a building.  Walked up a flight of stairs where some people were playing cards.  They commented on how 'fucked up that dude is'.  In my new body I proceeded down a hallway, opened a bathroom door, tripped and reached out to catch my fall.  My hand landed on a heater that scalded it, I then fell over onto a small garbage can that was full of broken glass which deeply imbedded itself in my side.  Then pain was as real as anything I had experienced in my normal life.  I lay on the floor as blood oozed out of me into a pool.  Someone opened the door behind me and it hit my head... I heard a woman's scream.Then things changed again.  I was surrounded by a red light and some shadowy figures came around me, propped me up and told me that what they were about to do to me was for my own good.  They proceeded to break my neck, ripping my head off, kick me repeatedly, drop an anvil on my head, stab me, and basically murder me numerous times.  If that wasn't enough, it happened all over again!  Just like pressing rewind on a video tape I was the homeless guy again walking into the bathroom only to get impaled by the glass all over again.Then the figures began murdering me over and over again.  This cycle continued about a half dozen times.  In desperation now, I had to get out of this situation.  I figured out that by moving my teeth against each other I could control the entire experience like a VCR.  I knew that if I could get my teeth to touch by a single atom that I could be rescued.  During this time I found myself inside an ambulance and eventually in a hospital bed.  I could hear the heart monitor beeping by the bedside.After fiddling with my teeth for a while I gently woke up and found myself back in the house where the whole night started.  I noticed there were only mild pattern hallucinations remaining and only about four and a half hours had passed.I actually soon forgot about the entire ordeal.  It wasn't until 3 weeks later when I took some mushrooms that GOD spoke to me through my solar plexus and told me that I had to return to that violent place, that it was my penance.That was over 12 years ago and I still live with a fear of that place.  I've been in the hospital a couple of times to manage what has now become a mild psychosis.  I pretty much have permanent mild visuals all the time and a fair bit of anxiety.  I know I've felt alone for a long time...  but with love and a lot of Yoga I've been able to make at least some peace with the whole ordeal like I never thought possible.Exp Year: 1991ExpID: 30744Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Aug 27, 2006Views: 9,512    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), HPPD / Lasting Visuals (40), Entities / Beings (37), Bad Trips (6) DOSE: T+ 0:004 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:202 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:145 lbMy 4th acid trip was the most incredibly psychologically horrifying event I'd ever endured. I had tripped (obviously) three times beforehand. My first trip was one tab white blotter and, overall (with the exception of the start of my trip) a good time. My second trip was 2 tabs of presumably the same white blotter and a very good time as I spent the entire night alone safely working on music in my home recording studio. Third was roughly the same as the second, same dosage, same activities, two friends around tripping with me, and by this time I had got to know a local chemist directly through some more experienced friend.The chemist and I hit it off really well, it was uncanny. We became great friends nearly instantly and would continue to hang out a lot until he moved out of town a few years later. We still keep in contact, but he stopped making acid a couple years ago (2003). Normally we'd chill out together, smoke weed, and listen to 70's psychedelic and prog rock, which we both were obsessed with at the time. He liked to come out and listen to me compose as well and give me suggestions (which I would normally ignore.) He made the stuff and it seemed fairly frequent or at least a regular basis, but I don't recall him often using it himself. Maybe once or twice that I can remember or maybe it happened normally and I just wasn't aware of it.At any rate, in 2000 I was allowed a sample of chemist's latest 'baby', free of charge. My birthday was coming around this freebie was my gift. Six altoid mints each dropped with chemist's latest stuff. I asked 'so hows this stuff then?' and he says 'probably about the same as the last but you'll be the first to take this one.'I was obviously excited.I had to wait about a week until things in my life were calm enough to actually take it. I had tripped before and had learned that it's an event I might want to plan for, and set an entire evening aside. Well being somewhat experienced but not very, and wanting to push the envelope a bit, I decided to take 4 to start. Subconsciously, 4 is an important number for me. I measure a lot of music by 4's, it was my 4th trip, and taking 4 doses at once with intent to work on music seemed to make sense. It seemed to.Anyway, I waited... and waited... and waited... Really I only waited probably 20 minutes, but when I am consciously waiting for acid to take effect, it seems to take forever and wait until I  least expect it to finally hit me. Growing impatient, I made the mistake a lot of people do and just went ahead with the remaining 2 doses. Within about 10 minutes I started feeling the first 4 and it was an incredible mind-blowing rush. This was far beyond the previous trips I had experienced in terms of energy level, dizziness, and visual effects that started almost immediately. It seemed like in a flash, I was looking through a rippling mirror or glass, everything was impossibly clear and crystalline, and normal colors of objects were replaced by morphing bright colors with a sort of metallic quality. In my basement where I was, the wall farthest from me that I was looking at seemed to open into some sort of rotating corridor but had I wanted to walk in, I lacked the coordination to get up and walk. I was thinking this was the greatest trip I would ever have and started laughing hysterically for a few minutes, completely euphoric. Then I think those last 2 doses started to work too. I was already on thin ice having taken more than I ever had and getting way more than I had expected, and those last 2 just put me over the edge completely.It was getting too intense for me. The room seemed to keep changing shape and appearance. My depth perception was completely fucked, and everything was turning different colors, then monochrome, then back and there were tracers but not like anything I had ever seen. These hovered and pulsed before breaking into thousands of pieces and disintegrating away. Not to mention I was seeing all this in a sort of weird stop-motion alternating with what we call 'television vision' but it was very severe. While this was going on, I would have moments of clarity that lasted a few seconds, then my logic was completely messed up again. I finally got it in my mind that I needed to get up off the couch and go work on music before things got too intense and I had a total flip out. So I forced my body to move and my legs to walk me into my studio where I fumbled with buttons and switches and knobs until things seemed to be on and functioning as normal.I couldn't even conceive of holding or playing a guitar at this point so I sat down at the keyboard to start, which had taken on the appearance of a kind of space ship control panel and all the knobs and buttons and sliders I was used to were now confusing me but at some basic level I still knew that I had to punch a series of buttons to call up certain sounds, so I did. I hit a few keys and startled the shit out of myself. The sound visually shot from the speakers and hung in the air suspended before splintering away. At some point in all this I think I zoned out for a few minutes (or more) and then it seemed to me that if I found a certain tone and chord, that it would calm everything down and I'd be sane again. I was convinced by this point that if I didn't do something I was going to end up about 100 times worse off mentally than Syd Barrett ever was. So I fiddled with more buttons and knobs and managed to get a sound I thought I liked, and I kept playing chords but all of them freaked me out even worse. It was like every time I failed to find the right chord and hit a wrong one instead, I was a notch closer to terminal insanity. Music was never so precarious.Finally, in one of those all too seldom, all too brief moments of clarity, I thought that at the time I was too fucked up to be musically productive. I abandoned the idea of writing at least for an hour or two, and was happy to find that my legs actually worked well enough for me to walk. Well that relief was quickly replaced by panic when I walked out the studio door (with everything taking on a funhouse mirror quality roughly) and looked to the far corner of the basement to see someone standing there completely still, staring at me. It wasn't an ominous stare or particularly menacing in a normal sense. It was menacing to me because the face was vaguely familiar and staring at me completely frozen with terror. I was coherent enough to remember doing the acid and I thought that someone had come to the house, a friend maybe, and had caught me just emerging from some terrible act that I was too obliterated to realize I had done. So then I started thinking 'did I just kill someone???' and freaking myself out severely with that idea. The mysterious terror-stricken apparition disappeared but now I had myself thinking I felt blood dripping from my mouth, like I dismembered someone and had been gnawing on random guts and innards. I convinced myself of a false memory of crouching over some fresh corpse, laughing and babbling while I dug organs out of their ripped abdomen and chewed on them, so I was flipping out again BAD and I think I scrambled upstairs. When I looked at the stairs on my way up, they seemed to be covered in blood and slime and I was leaving a trail of it. Complete hallucination, no reality to it at all as I found out later.I made it to the kitchen and immediately picked up the phone to call someone because some instinct told me I needed to have someone around to sort of ground me back in reality. I decided on a friend that lived just down the street, who I'll call B. I kept trying to dial but knew I wasn't dialing his number right so every time I got 3 digits into dialing, I'd hang up and curse, and my dog wandered in and started looking at me like I was crazy (which I probably was at that point) and seemed like even he was afraid of me because he just stood there looking all keyed up and worried. I decided to bend down to pat him on the head and he did start growling and ran off. I'm pretty sure that actually happened and it wasn't just the acid so I think I cursed at the dog too.Anyway I finally got the damn numbers right and though I have no recollection of what was said or how long the phone conversation lasted, I must have gotten out that I was tripping and freaking out because soon B was in my house and telling me I was just having a bad trip and needed to get out and have some air. He suggested we head to this park nearby and I agreed. By this time my own head noise was extremely irritating and I could barely distinguish real sight and sound from hallucination and I was extremely paranoid, but we got in his truck and just as we were pulling out of the driveway I opened the door and bolted down the street because I thought he was taking me to the police station or the hospital. So I remember running down the street and running on and on and on, and the streetlights bending down to hit me and tree branches squiggling black against the sky, and the entire sky was pulsing from red to grey and seemed to be rolling and breathing and growing sores in it, and finally I realized I was lost. But I couldn't have been that far away from home, I just was so fucked up I didn't recognize anything around me and I just knew I was out in some field but had no idea where.I was thinking 'where the fuck did I end up?' and I must have shouted it because I heard my own voice but it was very distant. Then it seemed like I was standing there still for days, watching cars go by in the distance and birds fly overhead, looking like badly drawn cartoons. I had momentary thoughts that I'd been hung out as a scarecrow by some psycho farmer.Well anyway, eventually B came and got me though I must have continued tripping hard and having nothing to do with reality for a few hours. I can remember having some pretty bad thoughts and the typical fear of being in that mental state forever but most of the time I wasn't even aware enough to consider it abnormal. I also remember feeling like decades of my life had flown past me and I was somehow suddenly ancient. At another point, probably toward the end of the trip, I thought I was some kind of agent of the universes, foretelling things in peoples' lives and I probably was really telling fortunes to people who weren't even there, I just thought I saw them. At yet another point, it seemed to me that I had somehow reached some level of existence where I could no longer interact with the world I had known but I was stuck observing it, like a ghost or something and that whole ghost trip lasted a long time. It evolved into me thinking I had died somehow and was a ghost and since B witnessed my death, he was able to see me but not understand what I was saying because (in my head at that point) ghosts speak a different kind of language that the living can't learn and of course, that is part of the divide between us. The whole thing was really messed up, no great insights, no remotely healthy logic, just complete insanity and loads of weird hallucinations and poisoned thoughts.I have since tried to get the fine details of those last few hours from B so I can piece it together a little better but he doesn't like to talk about it. It scared him more than me I guess. He's never done any acid in his life to this day. All he tells me about that time is that my eyes were completely black during most of it and that he thought I went totally mad and wouldn't come back, that I would end up in a psych ward trying to eat through the walls. What I've written here probably doesn't even convey a quarter of all the fucked up thoughts and visions or a tenth of the terror and paranoia I felt that time. It was the only really bad trip I've ever had.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 54287Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Sep 1, 2006Views: 50,583    LSD (2) : Alone (16), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD    smokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:120 lbMe and my friend were heading off to a small rave in the Midwest.  It started off all fine and dandy. I was simply looking for something to do one evening so I called my friend 'C'.  C informed me of the rave and since I had a fair amount of extra cash I thought I should go with him because he was planning on going by himself.  So we headed off. When we got there it was a very cool venue.  Huge silos were towering all around us and all I could see were cars all around us. After we got in I quickly started asking around for whatever I could get my hands on.  Well I must have done pretty well because after a short amount of time I ended up with numerous hits of LSD a small arsenal of X and a somewhat hefty bag of Mushrooms.  My friend was strapped for cash so I though I would brighten his day with a couple hits of Acid.  We went to the car to drop them.  We went back into the rave until the doses took effect and we both agreed on going to the car for the transition between coming up and peaking.  That way when we reached the peak we would walk back into the rave for a whole new scene, which is good.  While sitting in the car a couple of party kids saw up sparking the blunt through the window and kindly asked us if we had anything for them to roll their own weed in.  Being of the friendly nature that we are, I asked them if they just wanted to hop in and join us instead.  Of course they agreed.  Everything was going ok until I started to freak a little.  I don't know what my problem is but I get very paranoid on LSD and if no one stops me it just gets worse by the second.I found out the kids were from the same town as the party was being thrown in, not an unusual occurrence. But then I got the idea in my head that these two guys who joined us were really up to no good.  The way I figured it was that they knew what I had got from their friend who I bought it from and, for some reason unknown to me, they were scamming on taking it from me.  I sat for a moment pondering what I should do and out of know where I start threatening these kids as if they had done some great injustice to me.  I don't quite know why but I said somethin like, 'You know I could strangle the breath out of you.'  They were pretty surprised by this and so was my friend C.My friend didn't know exactly what to do with me now so he suggested that we go back to the party and chill out a little bit.  I told him I didn't want to go in there because I already had bad thoughts in my head and God only knows what a man on LSD can be capable of when he is not thinking right.  I told him we should leave and he didn't want to but eventually I talked him into it.  [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] The car ride home was very very bad.  We were both tripping pretty well and the previous scene had just shot both our brains into confusion.  He was mad that I wanted to leave so bad and so early, and I was mad because I thought the kids were trying to do me wrong.  He was the only one left to talk to so my mind convinced me that he was also up to no good.  We had very long and aggravating discussions and I'm sure neither of us at all understood what the other was talking about.I thought he had been trying to steal from me. And I have not the first clue what he was thinking, probably that I was losing my mind and taking him down with me.  It is impossible to explain what was said but what I can conclude from what our friends told me long after the incident he thought I was ragging on him for being a bad person and being worthless when I was really just going off on some totally wack idea that he was trying to steal from me.  I wish I could convey my feelings better but it was like every little thing he said in response to my questions, sounded exactly like what someone who was trying to do me wrong would say.  And every thing he said just more and more confirmed and strengthened what I was thinking.  After a while when there was nothing more to be said I realized that the whole time we were freaking out on each other, (or I guess I was freaking on him).  We had never turned.  So I asked him, 'Do you even know where we are?'   'no'   'Do you know what direction we are heading?'    'No'    'What the Fuck are we gonna do now.''  I asked him to turn around and just head back the way he came but he just kept driving.  The sun was coming up and I thought it was about time we figured out were we were and started home.  Neither of us were in good humor and we just wanted to go home.  I told him to just stop, so he did, literally. On the side of the highway he pulled over and we both got out of the car.  Luckily there was some sort of building a very short ways up the road so we sat there and just tried to cool off and sort out our problems.This was the first pleasant time in our whole journey. (I thought anyway).  He was laying on the ground and I was sitting next to him.  I think I realized that I was being a jerk so I tried to comfort him in anyway I could.  I don't exactly remember how we got on the subject but we started talking about drug addiction.  He told me he wanted help and I told him that I would try to help him.  I told him that together we could stop all the drug shit and make it together.   He hugged me.  I was cool with giving him as much emotional support he needed but, I pushed him away after a little bit when he wouldn't let go of me.  It made me very uncomfortable.  The next thing I know his eyes fill with tears and he smashes his cellular phone on the road and runs straight across the street into a corn field.  This bewildered me.After that I figured I was right all along about him and I walked away. Which probably wasn't the thing to do, but with a head full of acid your mind can only take so much.  I though I knew what city we were in and I had a brother that lived there so I thought no matter how far away I was from his house I would just walk.  I found out I was dead wrong.  It became clear to me that we were right outside some very tiny town and I was no were near where I wanted to be.There was something very wrong with a dog I encountered walking around.  At first he started ferociously barking at me, but it really didn't scare me.  I knew he was just acted tough and if I acted like he didn't bother me he would quit.  Luckily it worked.  He then followed me and would not go away.  Then I noticed something strange, nothing had happened to him but he was suddenly limping and whimpering.  I could tell he was trying to get me to follow him somewhere but when I didn't follow him he just kept following me. I thought that if this dog was trained to act hurt and lead people to, wherever he was trying to take me, there is something very very wrong with this little town and I had to get out of there ASAP. I walked downtown, (the whole 4 blocks of it) and figured I had no where else to go so I just sat and watched the clouds move back and fourth.  A truck with some pretty friendly people were out and I told them I would give them as much money as it took to give me a ride to where I wanted to go.  They told me they couldn't because they had something to do but they brought me to some people who could.  When I got to the house it was probably about 6 in the morning and they told me I had to wait for some guy to come to give me a ride.My mind was all screwed up from what had happened all night long so I was acting very weird towards these people.   Sitting outside of their house I saw an ambulance speed by and I thought, 'Oh shit someone spotted C in a cornfield freaking out!' So I went back in the house.  The guy finally came and gave me a ride 50 miles to where my brother lived.  When I got in his house, through a window, I woke up my brother and bitched at him until he gave me a ride another 70 miles to where my home was.  My brother had never seen me tripping before and that was very bad.A couple days later my mom confronted me about my use of acid and I really didn't know what to say,  she found out from C's mom because C ended up in an emergency room after failed attempts to kill himself.  I didn't know what to think.  Then I heard all the crazy roomers going around about how I tried to talk this guy into killing himself.  That story made a couple enemies for me.  In conclusion I felt really bad about what happened and only me and C, actually know the truth about what happened that night.  I wish that we could be friends again but I think that night pretty much ruined our friendship forever.  I don't know what to say, LSD almost made one of my former good friends kill himself and I wish it never happened but it did.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 10342Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Dec 13, 2006Views: 10,023    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:900 ugoralLSDBODY WEIGHT:120 lbOn a cold December evening in 1971 I took two 450ug tablets of LSD-25 at around 7 pm. I had planned the trip for a couple of days with a friend, but after I took two hits (I couldn’t wait) he never showed up.I was at a friend’s house sitting in his living room, about 20 to 30 minutes later. When four cinder blocks popped out of the walls and began spinning. I had taken several trips, but none that started this quickly. I also felt flushed, hot, and excited. My stomach was tight and my cheeks felt like they were burning. I could see every multi-colored red and green thread in my blue jeans. I sat in David’s room and talked to his sister for a while and listened to music. Everything was not only bright and colorful, but I felt uncontrollable urges to laugh, and kept having the feeling that time was flying past me. The music had come to be nothing more than white noise in the background as I explored the room.At about an hour into the trip I felt euphoric, and was very interested in the rapidly changing world about me. David’s sister had been doing something with the record player, I don’t remember what but I suddenly had a shock when she said, ‘Man, you are flipping,’ and said I had been staring at the record player for about ten minutes. Still, I felt OK and was too engrossed in the high level of visual hallucination I was experiencing to even think that I had gone too far. I walked back to my house when David had to eat dinner. I crossed a park through knee deep fluorescent orange coils that sprang into the air with a twangy sound when I moved my feet…across the park I saw my mother and brothers getting out of the car. I had a sudden and intense attack of guilt.It wasn’t ordinary guilt, it was all the sins of the world piled on my shoulders, because I had taken LSD. I saw our dog, ‘Luv’ and she raced across the park to greet me. I forgot about my sins and guilt as I looked at Luv, and I felt her compassion and love for me. I decided not to go home because I would ‘look too stoned’ I walked up the street aimlessly. This was about two hours into the trip. Overhead, the sky was filled with racing clouds and bolts of lightning, something like you might see in a depiction of how the sky looked on earth when life first crawled out of the sea. I had to urinate, so I stepped into an alley. As I did, I saw splotches of colors run out of a wall. I can distinctly see those colors in my mind, pink and black. I thought they were the most beautiful colors I had ever seen. They soon dissolved.I went back to David’s house and he had finished eating. We went back to his room and I don’t remember much for the next hour or so. We listened to music, and he played guitar, but I can’t remember feeling or thinking anything. At 10 pm his mother said he had to go to bed. We went out to the yard and he told me to come back after his parents light went out. As we stood in the yard, he gave me some change, as I took the coins he told me to look at the plane flying over. As I looked up, I heard him say, What is that in your hand? I jerked my hand back because a silver and purple liquid had melted and was running out of my hand. As I did the coins fell out and David roared. I was beginning to think the trip was getting out of hand, and felt for the first time a high level of anxiety.I looked out across the park, and suddenly from a bright spot in the darkness of a cluster of trees a white light raced towards me, engulfed me, and I felt an explosion of color and a bolt of electricity race through my body, as though I had been struck by lightning. The explosion of color was mostly red and silver, It was rather like a crystal shattering into a million pieces inside my brain. At that instant, I began to panic. David told me to calm down and come back and he’d help me. I started crying, I was experiencing the most intense fear I had ever experienced. I walked down the street and kept receiving explosions of shattering crystal in my Head, accompanied by the lightning bolts in my body. Everything was breathing heavily, moving and ‘real’ physical movement was followed by strobing trails of purple.I had the feeling that I wasn’t really there in my body. I heard thousands of voices in my ears telling me, ‘Now you’ve done it! You are dying.’ Over and over I heard these voices. I saw a sign on a church that said, ‘What are you doing on earth, for Heaven’s sake?’ and was gripped by more fear. Every feeling, every sensation I experienced was negative and the most intense emotion I had ever experienced. I went to a phone booth and called the pastor of our church. I’m not sure if I dialed the right number, because all the pages of the phone book had come flying out and were floating around the booth. I did hear a voice, but I can’t remember the details.The next few hours were spent walking up and down a street near the pastor’s house. I can’t begin to describe all the colors, emotions and sensations at this point. The underlying theme was religious, with the most intense fear of dying and a state of pure panic gripping me the whole time. I do remember the repeated bolts of lightning and shattering crystal. Each time a car passed, I would first hear the sound of the car as though it were driving over the keys of a huge piano. This would be accompanied by a brief and intense image of colored crystal forming, from which a white point would emerge, expand, and engulf me in an explosion of light that would shatter the crystal. The worst of it was the physical feeling of electric shock. As I felt the trip begin to release its grip, I started home.Someone gave me a ride, a couple of old people that I remember scorned me about not attending church. My mother found out, in such a state of panic-stricken terror I entered the house, and my sister came out to screw with my mind a while. I was shaking uncontrollably and would not look at myself in the mirror. The worst was over by around 5 am. For the next two years, I couldn’t sleep, and was afraid of the dark. The reason was that when I turned off the lights I would hallucinate. I saw colors and patterns for years after that trip, and kept myself heavily sedated with alcohol or other drugs. The pure horror at that trip was enough to keep me from further serious attempts at LSD, though I did a little of the weaker stuff a few times after that. Some background; I had experienced two years of severe depression before that episode with the LSD. I didn’t realize it at the time, but it was like being stuck in molasses. Years later I was diagnosed as bipolar. I dropped out of school a few months after that trip.One note on the dosage. My mother had contacted the state police narc squad, and they came and gave her a little seminar about LSD. They told her at that time that the ‘white microdot’ samples they had obtained from the batch being sold in town had been sent and tested at around 450ug of LSD, and that many kids had been to the hospital because of intense experiences. Even at that time, late 1971, strong acid was getting scarce. Certainly none of the other LSD I took--white lightning, Orange Sunshine, Windowpane, or Mr. Natural--where anywhere near the strength of that microdot. They weren’t in the same ballpark, league, or even on the same planet.Exp Year: 1971ExpID: 41534Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Dec 29, 2006Views: 106,569    LSD (2) : Depression (15), HPPD / Lasting Visuals (40), Bad Trips (6), Alone (16) DOSE:4 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:145 lbMe and four friends obtained 1 sheet of freshly-dipped white blotter acid on the night of the *Fucking Train Wreck from Hell.* As we dosed the acid, a mood of anticipation had set in, not unlike the feeling you get the first time you take acid. We were out to do something fresh- take four hits for the first time. There were five of us that fateful night, and five of us were well experienced psychonauts. Little did we know that only four of us would completely return.We got back to my friend Charles' grandmother's house and began to set his room to our likings. The walls were covered in blacklight posters, the ceilings had mirrors all over the den portion, and Pink Floyd had been selected for the aural journey. The party began at 8:30 PM.T+30, 9:00. The acid began to come on slowly, and a slight, queasy stomach fever began to run its course. I'm quite sure everyone else was feeling the same effects, judging from the edgy looks on their faces. The hyper feeling began to set in. My limbs became tight, and I felt as if I had a few pulled muscles in my legs.T+1:00, 9:30. Oh, we were tripping indeed. Me and three of my other unnamed friends were seeing patterns like we had never seen before. The walls were breathing, and the blacklight posters seemed portals to another dimension. We began to joke around nonsensically, all the while paying little attention to our quiet host who had become catatonic.T+1:30, 10:00. Charles had lost it early on in the long night, and we began to take notice. He had sunken deeply into the couch, looking sharply from left to right as he mumbled 'Did you see that?,' and 'I don't know, man' to the walls. He didn't respond to any outside stimulus. We called to him, telling him 'It's gonna be O.K.,' and 'Just hang in there, we're here with you.' Nothing worked. The night looked like it was going to get much longer at this point, and Charles wasn't helping us out.T+2:00, 10:30. Our host was lying in front of the TV, mumbling to himself, when we noticed that his eyes were rolled back in his head. We shook and tryed to rouse him, but he just responded by mumbling 'I feel wweeeiiirrrddd.' We decided we would ignore him, lest we end up in his shoes. Suddenly, one of our female companions looked down at his torso and shouted 'Dude, he's jacking off!!' At this point, things began to get chaotic. Charlie's little torso was wiggling like a worm in heat as he shouted 'I feel weeiirrddd!!!' with his hands down his pants. I put my hands over his mouth and he proceeded to lick my palms furiously. I withdrew, and said 'Maybe if we let him finish he'll calm down.' Mistake #1: Don't let a guy sit in the same room with you while he jacks off to Pink Floyd. We were tripping nuts by this time (good acid). He continued to play with himself while we agonized over the next course of action. Before we knew it, he had finished and looked like he might stay relatively calm for a little while. Not a chance.T+2:30-5:00 11:00-1:30. Charles began to shout 'I feel weeiirrdd!' at the top of his lungs and started to masturbate again. We decided it was closet time for Charlie (there were women, we feared for their safety). Me and my other friend proceeded to pick Charles up and put him in the closet for a little 'quiet time.' After that, we were to head outside to regroup our thoughts and decide our next course(s) of action. Needless to say, quiet time didn't apply to Charles. He rambled and grunted homosexual slurs under his breath as we heave-hoed his ass into the closet. We locked the door and ignored his muffled wails as we grabbed the 3-foot bong and headed outside. As we sat outside without our shoes, we decided it was definitely time to go. The acid was in full effect, and much more of this mental-house madness would send us into a *really* bad trip. We called a friend to come and get us. As we walked in the house, we knew Charles's luck had gone from Frank Botha to Mike Tyson (bad to bad ass).He had broken the door of the closet and was standing in the middle of the room without his pants. We told the girls to leave, we knew it was going to get 'messy'. They ran outside crying, and we pulled ourselves together to dive head-first into the jizzum jungle. We made it to the other side of the room and grabbed all of the shoes we could get our hands on. Charles was speaking softly now, saying 'The cat left the hamburber by the pail of garbage so he could lose the moon.' He was spinning around in circles playing with himself.About this time, my friend Brent barged through the door of the room with keys-a-jinglin'. Charlie reached out and grabbed Brent's arm. Brent swung around, and ripping his wrist free of Charlie's grip said, and I quote, 'Charlie, I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you, but if you don't get your goddamn hands off of me right now, I'm gonna knock you the fuck out!!' Miraculously, Charles understood our piping-hot friend and let go. As we rushed out of the room, I slipped on spum and sprained my damned ankle. We were on our way home, and Charles was on his way to more trouble.T+5:00-Aftermath. After we came down around 6:00AM, we decided to head home. As I limped through the door, the shit hit the fan. My mom and my dad were perched in an armchair in the den. They asked me where I had been. I told the truth. They asked me if I had been using LSD. I lied. Dad finished the trip report for me.It turns out Charles had made his way upstairs to his grandmother's room, and woke her up as he stood completely naked in front of her bed masturbating. In a panic, she called her daughter to the scene. His mother found the acid, the buds, and my other shoe (I didn't realize it was missing until after I made it home). Recognizing the shoe, she called my dad to the house. He showed up to see Charlie lying naked in the den of his grandmother's house jacking off and talking about 'the birds and beezles' while his entire family watched. I was in deep shit, to say the least.Charles has never completely recovered. He had an intense religious conversion that lasted for nearly a year, and he still seems a little off-base. The flashbacks eventually subsided, but the social damage caused by that night has just begun to be repaired.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 13155Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 13, 2007Views: 118,514    LSD (2) : Health Problems (27), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Sex Discussion (14), Post Trip Problems (8), HPPD / Lasting Visuals (40), Second Hand Report (42), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:  oralLSD(blotter / tab)   oralAlcohol - Beer/Wine(liquid)   smokedCannabis BODY WEIGHT:145 lbI had done speed and smoked a lot of weed before trying LSD; in fact I'd always been scared to try LSD although I didn't understand anything about it. All the stories I had heard where about great experiences. Unfortunately for me, my first and only trip turned out to be the worst experience of my life.It all started at my friends house, there was about 4 or 5 of us and I thought we was originally going to smoke some weed and just have a few beers but some guy my friend knew from the army pulled out some LSD. I can't remember what they where other than he said they where purple homs - double dipped, whatever that meant. I guess they dip the tab wait for it to dry then its dipped again.I didn't want to take it, but I thought I'd look like a whimp if I didn't, I guess today I'd rather of dealt with being called a whimp than have to deal with what I went through.I dropped it; about 30 minutes later I felt the initial sensation that I was reserved inside myself. I guess you could call it a feeling of defensiveness. My sensory perception was the first to go, along with feelings of paranoia. I was sitting in a chair facing all my other friends and I remember thinking the music was too loud, so I got up to turn the music down. My friends where looking at me a little weird. After I sat back down, I remember thinking, the music is too quiet, so I got back up and turned the music back up. Then again I thought now its too loud and got back up and turned it back down. This went on for quite a while, then I realized, oh no, is this was the trip has done to me?I was kind of stuck in a loop repeating my actions of getting up and down. Something was in my mind telling me stuff, I thought I have to ignore whatever my mind is telling me to beat this thing, whatever it was. I thought to myself, this trip is going to be some kind of test and I have to beat it.Of course after realizing that this was not going to be fun, I started to panic. But inwardly I thought, oh well I better try and handle it. I remember the feelings of paranoia, I could hear every little sensational noise, I noticed my friend had a copy of murder casebook on the floor, and I started to think about maybe they where after me or where conspiring against me. I could hear the neighbors kids screaming which all added to the paranoia of seeing a book on serial killers on my friends floor.I thought I have to get this out my system so I went to the bathroom and put my fingers down my throat all to none affect. I remember my friend coming up to me and asking me if the trip had kicked in yet and I said, “yes”. I didn’t really care at the time only that I had made a big mistake and there was nothing I could do about it. The sensations started to come and go about once every 10 minutes, I knew when it was going to happen and I tried to fight it. But eventually I couldn’t control it. I thought my only chance is to go to sleep and sleep it off, I walked down my friends hallway into the bedroom at the end and I climbed into bed. I remember lying down and thinking I have to fall asleep. Of course I couldn’t. So I got back up and started to walk back down the hallway towards the living room. When I got closer to the hallway, I kind of blinked and I ended up back outside the bedroom door. I thought what the heck, I just walked down there and how did I end up back here. I walked down the hallway again and I got to the living room and same thing, I blinked my eyes and I was back outside the bedroom door. I tried it again and again, and same thing every time I got closer to the living room I would blink and be back by the bedroom door.I remember a very distinct thought saying to me, “This is hell, your are stuck in this hallway now for eternity”. The thought was the devil, I said to myself. I got very scared within myself. After a while this wore off, I got into the living room. I think I tried to tell my friend what just happened but they where all busy boasting about their little trips and their last thing that just happened to them. I sat down in the living room in the same chair and my friend said he was going out to take the dog for a walk. 2 other of my friends said they was going to go with him. So I said to them, “Oh I’ll go with you guys”. They responded very abruptly, “No you won’t you have to stay here”. I guess I must have been tripping more than them and they knew it. Of course within my own little trip world I started to get paranoid, why didn’t they want me to go, they are conspiring to do something, maybe even kill me. So I thought to myself I have to get out of here quick and get home.Of course this was going to be a difficult task as I lived about 6 miles from my home. I ran down the hallway into my friend’s bedroom and ran to the window. I opened the window as wide as it would go and jumped out the window. Luckily for me my friend lived on the ground floor of a bungalow style house. I remember just thinking to myself I have to get the heck out of here. I ran across this wooded area up towards a bridge where the main bus route went down. I climbed up the small embankment to the side of the bridge and onto the main road. I started to run up the road wanting to get home to my family and away from these people.I could feel my heart starting to beat faster and faster (I assume because I was running so fast). I started to hear voices telling me I was going to die and that this was my end. I started to hear an ambulance siren coming towards me. I remember stopping running and thinking, “Oh know I’m going to have a heart attack and die”. I remember the fear very distinctly and the fear of death and not wanting to die like this. But then the ambulance went past where I was, it was a mere coincidence that at the time I was tripping and was running that an ambulance happened to race by, or was it even there at all I wondered. I realized it was a part of the trip after all. I continued to run up the road, I must have run a good mile to the next crossroads. For some reason I stopped heading for the direction of home and I crossed the street and stood behind this barred fence with railings. As I was standing there, I remember this semi-truck coming towards me, I thought oh God he’s coming right for me, so I ran the opposite direction.I reached a work development where there were a lot of factories and I turned down into their development, I remember walking and seeing soccer ground with floodlights on the ground, so I climbed over the fence onto the grounds. I remember walking across the field looking up into the lights, thinking it was some spectacular mystery. I put my hands in my pocket and pulled out my money and threw it all in the air, then I took my watch of and threw it also, then my house keys. I then took my sweatshirt off and threw it in the air. I was now walking round with no money, no keys to get in my house and no top on. I remember falling into the grass. The grass was about 6 feet tall and that I was getting smaller and smaller. I could hear a stream of water starting to run around me and I then appeared to be in the water looking from a different perspective. I remember distinct thoughts saying to me that I was a molecule or some kind of cellular structure just floating around in a stream; I was some kind of stream creature.I don’t remember much after this other than I must have blacked out. I came to about 3 to 4 hours later and thought where the heck am I. I started to have memories of seeing some old man with white hair at this mansion and I was talking to him. I wasn’t tripping no more but I was having these memories of what had happened, I thought I was either dreaming or was having flashbacks. I remember a voice telling me I was the luckiest, greediest man in the world, I have no idea who was telling me this and why. I thought to myself at first that I must of died and that maybe this man had sent me back to earth because my time was not yet, and that this memory was from the place I had just came back from. My head was so messed up, I couldn’t think right.I started to think how the heck am I going to get back to my friends house. I started to walk back out of the development and I saw 2 security guards driving past. They drove up to me; of course I was walking with no shirt on so they knew something was wrong. Right away they asked me if I was ok and had I been taking drugs. I told them I was ok and I knew where I was. They told me that they had seen me wondering around the development a few hours ago.They drove me to their security hut and called the police. I remember hearing the police on the speakerphone. The security guy told the police that I had been taking drugs and was wondering around the development. The police asked the security guy if I was ok now and did I know where was, I told them yes, as I didn’t want the police to come out, because if they took me home my mom would know I had taken drugs. So I told them, yes I knew where I was. The police said they wouldn’t bother coming out then. After that I told the security guy that I lost my shirt and keys etc.I told him I threw it on the field, he just looked at me like I was crazy. I guess I was. Anyway he went and found my sweatshirt but couldn’t find my money or keys. They let me go then. So I walked up the road thinking where the heck am I. I saw a taxi cab and flagged him down. I asked him did he know the name of my friend’s road and he said yes, it was about a mile away. So I got in and he took me to my friends. By this time it was 6am in the morning. I had taken the LSD around 12 midnight. I think I actually blacked out for at least 4 hours. My friends afterwards told me they had been searching for me for about 4 hours around the streets.I tried to tell them what had happened but I couldn’t remember much. My friend gave me a change of clothes and I went home like nothing had happened. To this day my family doesn’t know what I did that night. I never took LSD ever again in fact any other drug or weed again.I few weeks later, I went to the same friends house and he was smoking weed, I went in and sat down. My friend asked me if I wanted a cup of tea. So I said yes. I started drinking the tea and all of a sudden I looked at the tea and a voice said to me, they have dropped LSD in your tea. I started to freak out and cuss at my friend saying, “You have spiked my tea, what the heck”. He just looked at me like I was crazy. I said to my other  friend, “Lets get out of here”, and I left. I never went back to his house again after that. This was my first inclination that I had some permanent damage due to the LSD a few weeks before. This whole account of what happened that night could not compare to what really happened. The fear, the paranoia and the schizophrenic thoughts constantly bombarding my mind with harassment and propaganda. I would tell anyone even thinking of taking LSD to reconsider. I never thought this would affect me the way it has. I was no different to my friends in personality, but why it affected me different I don’t know. My friends never did explain to me after what they experienced even to this day. All of us kind of drifted apart over the years.This was not the end by no means. About 7 years ago, this was years after I had given up drinking and smoking weed etc. I was working out regular and was running a few times a week. I was running my daily routine of about a mile and a half of a fast run and I got to the end of my run and was approaching a hill, I remember feeling my heart beat real fast. All of a sudden, bam, I was having flashbacks of the time I was running in my trip and heard the ambulance. I was getting thoughts of I was going to die and have a heart attack.I stopped running and walked home the rest of the way. I went home and went upstairs and cried bitterly. I thought to myself this stuff has destroyed my mind. I started to panic and started to have a bad panic attack. I could hear thoughts of what I thought was the devil telling me I was going die and that he was going to get me and that I was going to hell. I was crying and didn’t know what to do. I could feel this heaviness on my back like something was on me, a force, a bad spirit whatever you want to call it. After this I kneeled down by my bed and prayed to God to take it away. Eventually after that experience I became a Christian and gave my life to God. I have suffered panic attacks since but on a milder scale also the thoughts constantly bombarding me sometimes don’t stop, my mind is constantly racing around, I’m constantly thinking non stop about everything. I question everything and find it hard to trust people. I still get fear and dread sometimes out of nowhere. Also not long after this I was at college and went through a bad panic attack while walking through the college hallway. I started to think I was in some kind of hell corridor and that I was trapped in this corridor amongst all this evil. I walked out really quick. Also another time when I got on a bus I was walking down the bus to go sit on the back seat and all the faces on the bus where looking at me, I started going real paranoid and started to have flash backs. I thought the bus was in hell and all the people where demons and they where at any second going to jump up and grab me like a crazy zombie movie. I freaked out and got off the bus. I walked 2 ˝ miles to my friends because I couldn’t get back on the bus.I have learnt to live with it over the years but in effect it died down a lot, I try and keep myself stress free as to not bring on any kind of flash back. LSD has affected me on a permanent level. I hope this convinces at least one person to not take LSD.God Bless.UnknownExp Year: 1990ExpID: 37641Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 9, 2007Views: 53,910    LSD (2), Police / Customs (60) : General (1), First Times (2), Health Problems (27), Post Trip Problems (8), HPPD / Lasting Visuals (40), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:000.5 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 1:301.0 gsmokedCannabis(plant material)  T+ 5:002 shotsoralAlcohol - Hard(liquid)BODY WEIGHT:210 lbEXPERIENCE LEVEL AT THE TIME OF THE TRIP: marijuana (daily, chronic user), LSD (4 trips), mushrooms (5), XTC (7 times)I believe I have to add something from me here, so that others can read and think for themselves :-) but I am writing this not only for the others to see but also for me - to get it off my chest and to be able to come to terms with that was the by far SCARIEST experience of my life. It might be lengthy but it is MY story so I will try to give you the most accurate report.OK, now for some introduction- (dating back to 1998)I live in Poland, am 23 at the moment. It wasn't until after my 18th birthday when I began experimenting with drugs. I went on winter holidays with my friends. Until then, I only drank beer and vodka and that's it. I didn't even smoke cigarettes. During our 7-day stay in Austria, my friends convinced me to smoke some pot. I thought 'What the heck?' and tried it. I didn't feel much the first time, but eventually I loved that shit :-) and after about 1 year of occasional smoking I have developed a habit of daily smoking which lasts until now. :-)### 4 years later ###I have a girlfriend, Mary (she was 22 at the time), whom I love and care for. We went through a lot together. It is January. Mary's parents decided to visit their friends and we had an empty house for ourselves, except for Mary's younger brother who was 17, for like 7-8 hours until we had to drive to get them back from the party which was on the outskirts of our city (this is important, will be explained later). Because I had some acid we decided to drop it that day and drive for Mary's parents after it comes down.OK, so it was about 16:00 when we split the blotter in half and held it under our tongues. Mary's brother picked up some friends of his (3 guys of his age). He doesn't smoke weed, doesn't do any drugs, only alcohol. So they bought some cheap liquor and started drinking.Mary invited some of her friends, but nobody showed up until 17:00 when only a couple came (Michael & Dorothy). OK, so until like 17:30 nothing was really happening. We had a laugh here and there, but no visual no trippy thoughts no nothing. Being a chronic heavy weed smoker :-) I proposed smoking some pot from what you would call a 'crack pipe' in the U.S.  This is a very popular way of smoking weed in Poland - and a very efficient one. OK, so we took a couple of hits from the 'crack pipe' of what was very good quality skunk, but 15 minutes later, still nothing was happening. Then Michael proposed doing some bucket hits (gravity bong). I agreed. He did everything, set up the bucket, filled it with water, prepared the plastic bottle, etc.We took a huge glass pipe and filled it with approx. 0.5g of the skunk. He did the set-up and I was the first one to take the hit. OK, so I took it, big deal.OK, I was able to breathe again. I felt the hit, but still nothing was happening. Now it was Mary's turn. She turned to me and said 'Maybe I shouldn't do this' and then I said 'No, it's prefectly okay, do it'. She was hesitating but she took the hit.And then...THE SCARIEST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE BEGAN...She took the bucket hit and she didn't cough. She turned red. Her whole face was red. She looked at me. She couldn't even cough it out. She couldn't breathe. Meanwhile, my hit started really affecting me. Everything slowed down 10x. Trails were starting to appear. My heart was beating veeery fast, way too fast. I was really scared, but it was only the beginning.Now Mary looks at me and I see terror and a silent scream in her eyes 'Help me I can't breathe'. I take her to her room. She's trying to show me that she can't breathe, she can't cough that shit out. A 'movie' starts forming in my head. I gave her the acid, I convinced her to do the hit, now I am responsible and she looks like she's dying in front of me. I make her sit on her bed and look deeply in her eyes. 'Do you want me to call an ambulance?'. She shakes her head. Mary's father is a policeman so my terror was overtaking me. Now thoughts of guilt and fear start overtaking my mind.Finally, after what seemed like ages, she exhaled a cloud of smoke and started crying. The thoughts in my head were even worse now 'Why is she crying? What did I do to her?'. This became almost psychotic. I sat beside her on the bed and that was when the bucket hit really affected me. Everything suddenly went 2D, cartoon-like. I didn't see any depth in my vision. It was like falling away from a flat screen. I didn't know it was the weed. I felt extremely petrified. My girlfiend's hands grew veeeeeeeeeery long and suddenly I couldn't recognize her. 'Who is this girl?' I though. Then she looked like my English teacher, then like my mother, then like some other girl. 'Who is she?' I though. 'Who am I?' was another thought. Terror. Fear. 'What is happening? How am I going to survive in a 2D world'? It was 18:10, approx. 5 mins after my bucket hit.My girlfriend stood up and I tried to say something 'happy' to cheer her up or just to ground us because I saw my fear in her eyes. I said 'We are on LSD, we are coming up'. And then I felt it. Oh My God!!! I couldn't understand it then, but it felt like things were happening just as I was saying them. I said 'We are coming up into higher dimensions'. And I felt it. I knew that we both felt it. It was like we were becoming ONE MIND. We tried talking, but that didn't help. It was like:ME: What...MARY: is happening?ME: I...MARY: knowME: How...?MARY: I don't know. But...ME: what...MARY: is happening?Looping conversations leading to the starting point. We couldn't get out of this situation. So we decided to go outside. Going through the corridor was scary, but when we came out, I was petrified. Suddenly, EVERYTHING in my field of vision started leaving LONG trails. Now imagine turning your head and not being able to recognize anything because everything was covered with trails. I held Mary as we stood near the door. I looked at her. It was completely dark, but I saw her face glowing with light. She later told me she saw the same but she also saw my thoughts as 'dreadlocks' coming from my hair to the back of my skull. :-/So we were standing outside in the dark and she said 'Honey, I'm so scared'. Well, so was I. 'Don't worry' I said 'We are in the matrix'. And then I felt it again. We were a couple hanging inside the matrix which was infinite and a light breeze was blowing.It was so scary that we decided to head back into the house. When we closed the door, suddenly a question came out of nowhere 'WHO AM I?'. I was walking with Mary to her room and I couldn't recognize where is up, down, left or right. I suddenly felt like Johny Depp in 'Fear and Loathing...' when he was walking like a madman, and I understood him :-) why he was walking like that.We came back to the room and Mary just laid on her bed. I desperately wanted to keep track of time, so I looked at my cellphone. It was 18:17. This was SCARY as for me eternity has passed, ages, but it was only 7 mins. :-( I turned on the stopwatch and look at it and I was petrified. There was the hour counter, minute counter, second counter and 100ths of seconds counter which looked like this 00:00:00.74 etc. Now normally the 100ths of seconds go so fast you can't even see them. I saw them like 00.16,00.18,00.20,00.22... now I though 'If this is the way I feel 100ths of seconds, how the fuck am I going to survive a couple of hours until the acid comes down?'.Mary asked my 'Honey, what is happening?' She had no clue. I told her 'We have to survive 45 minutes until the peak is over'. I had an idea to put on some music, one CD, until it all comes down a bit. So I took Lauryn Hill 'miseducation' and I put it on. When you take this cd and listen to it, when you put on the intro, there is a ring, like 'rrrrrrrrring' for a few seconds. For me it was an everlasting 'rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring' which couldn't end so I turned the CD player off.Terror, fear, guilt, all were in me. I couldn't bear it. I went to another room, where Mary's brother's friends were driking. They had some different music. I danced to it (I DON'T DANCE AT ALL usually) and I was like a visualizer from Winamp. I danced for what seemed like minutes, but Mary's brother told me later it was like 6 or 7 seconds :-)I came back to Mary and sat with her. I suddenly saw 'tunnels' of thoughts in my head. There was a small 'bubble' flowing through these tunnels. I concentrated on the bubble and everything disappeared and only the 'bubble' stayed. I mean I felt a bubble (as a mathematical point with no dimension) in my head and INFINITE space in each direction. This was the peak.Eventually we came down at around 21:00 (3 hours later), had to drive to pick up Mary's parents, which was like 20 miles but felt like driving from New York to San Francisco. I had a couple of shots of vodka still a bit high on acid and with my pupils huge as pizza plates :-). Its funny no one noticed that :-)[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] The funny thing is Mary's brother's friends were all drunk and vomitting around 20:00 and they came back to life at 21:00, they woke up exactly at the time we came down.Exp Year: 2002ExpID: 29601Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 10, 2007Views: 13,437    LSD (2), Cannabis (1) : Combinations (3), Music Discussion (22), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:4 hits LSDBODY WEIGHT:150 lbOne fall, a number of years ago, I had an experience that completely unraveled, completely obliterated every idea I had about myself and reality. I went camping alone with 12 hits of LSD. I wasn't after any experiences. I just wanted to see what LSD had to offer. From the writings of J. Krishnamurti I had become convinced that the spiritual journey is just an illusion. You're either awake or you're not. There's no in-between of becoming awake I had come to believe. But I wasn't completely convinced of this idea. I thought that LSD might be able to help me wake up a little, move me along the spiritual path a little, the path that Krishnamurti saw as an illusion.I had read Stanislav Grof's book 'The Adventure of Self-Discovery' and in it he relates stories of people who overcome various psychological problems through the use of LSD during psychotherapy. I hoped that LSD could have the same positive psychological effect for myself. Lessening my psychological burden I felt could bring me a little closer to waking up to my true nature. A friend dropped me off in the woods, and I found a good camping spot a fair distance away from any roads and people. I was going to wait and take some LSD the next day. I thought it would be a good idea to spend a day settling into a more tranquil mood. I was aware of the power of LSD. That's why I had just bought a walkman and headphones and a tape of Gregorian chant. I felt that listening to Gregorian chant would help induce a good trip. Well, I decided not to wait until the next day. In the early afternoon I took four hits of LSD. I lied down in my tent to listen to Gregorian chant. In less than half an hour I was tripping. I looked up out of my tent (I didn't have the rain-fly on) and saw the tree branches and the ripples on the tent from the wind moving to the Gregorian chant. The movement of the clouds slowed down. An indescribable beauty infused everything. I opened up the tent door and was stopped by a dead leaf lying right in front of my tent on my groundcover. The veins in the leaf weaved and undulated. Looking more closely I saw smaller and smaller divisions in the leaf. The sun shone through small holes in the leaf reavealing a deep red-orange glow. I said to myself, 'It's soooo beautiful'. The whole existence of the leaf revealed itself to me. I saw the leaf being born, growing, reaching its' glorious fruition, and then dying and shriveling up into nothing, only to repeat the whole process again. It was so glorious. I was awe-struck. I watched the the cycle of existence of the leaf happen over and over. Then I looked at the blue ground-cover of my tent. It undulated like ocean waves. I felt that all it contained was immense. I saw the oil taken from the earth to make it. I felt the oil of the earth being thoughtlessly, selfishly plundered in the ground-cover. I saw the war and hate and energy and greed connected to my ground-cover. I cried hard. But then I saw that it was just part of the earths' trip. Part of its' trip was to have a 'bad trip'.I stepped out of my tent and looked at how beautiful and meaningful the whole world was. I wondered how it was possible to have a bad trip. I couldn't understand how people could have bad acid trips. But then I thought that a good friend of mine knew that I was going to have this good trip and having it would show in his mind that I was inherently different from him because he had always had bad experiences on acid. I thought that he'd feel alienated from me now and bring a permanent rift in our relationship. I now realized the good trip could actually be a bad thing. This troubled me, but I put it out of my consciousness. The next thing I knew, without thinking it was strange, was coming to after a lapse of consciouness in my tent. The first time I didn't know I had had a lapse of consciousness. I again looked at the leaf outside my tent, and then got out of the tent and looked at a particular tree by the tent. The next time I came to in my tent I thought, 'Hmm, this is like deja vu.' But I still didn't think it was strange reapeating the same experience for the third time in several minutes. The fourth and fifth times it happened I thought, 'Wait, something strange is happening.' I wondered who or what was playing this trick on me. I began to doubt the essential beauty and benevolence of the world which I'd had no doubt of just shortly ago. I decided to lie down and listen to Gregorian chant for the rest of the trip in the hope that the beautiful music would block out my troubling thoughts.  But now as I looked up through my tent the trees and the sky looked lifeless, cold and distant. This disturbed me. I threw off the headphones and unzipped my tent to look at the leaf again. I saw it shriveling up over and over into a grotesque, gray, lifeless leaf. There was no life in it. Only death. I told myself that the world wasn't really like this. I told myself that existence itself is the highest meaning and life is at its' core and that it was only the LSD that was making me see the world as meaningless and dead. But then I thought that I wouldn't have to affirm the inherent goodness and positivity of the world to myself if it really were true.Yet once the doubt had slipped in there seemed to be no way to get rid of it. My earlier wonderful trip became increasingly hellish. I told myself that I was just having a bad LSD trip and that the world was in fact good. But then I thought that if the world really was good I wouldn't be able to have a bad LSD trip. Before I realized it everything had ceased being beautiful, good and meaningful and had become grotesque, sinister and meaningless. I worried that the bad trip might never end and thought I might need to go get help because I'd damaged my brain. But I still had some objectivity on my experience because I thought how I didn't want to draw others into my hell and paranoia and just further confirm the meaninglessness of existence. I decided to stay alone in the woods, but then I began feeling sick to my stomach. I wondered whether I was just imagining I was sick or whether I really was. I tried to remember something I had done early in the day that could be making me sick. I remembered that I hadn't purified the water that I had gotten from a spring early in the day. A scoutmaster out camping with his troop had even offered me some purifying tablets but I had turned him down saying I never purified spring water. I thought the untreated water might be killing me. I thought I might die. All because I was too arrogant to accept some purifying tablets. And it was the arrogance not just of this moment but of my whole life that was now going to kill me.As I sat in horror deciding what to do next everything merged and coalesced with everything else destroying the tangibility of each individual object. Time and space dissolved. My sleeping bag and tent stretched and contracted. I wondered who I was. I was no longer sure. Most of the ideas I had about who I was no longer felt tenable. It felt that my whole life had necessarily culminated to this moment. All I felt I knew was that I had to come to terms with the fact that I was a wretched human being and that life was meaningless. I could either leave right then and go back to my friends on the farm where I lived and let them know I knew they knew I knew that life was meaningless and that all humans were in eternal conflict with each other and everything and that all we could do was feign communion and happiness. I also knew that if I went back to my friends I'd have to go to the hospital and my parents would find out I'd taken LSD and had almost killed myself as a result. I felt like I'd be reduced to a pathetic, worthless, repulsive individual if my parents found out what I'd done.  My other choice would be to stay in the woods and die. Either way my identity of being a 'good person' would be destroyed. I felt overwhelming dread seeing that I was caught in a vicious Catch-22. But, I thought, there'd at least be some redemption if I went back and let everyone know that I realized all of my 'idealistic' dreams were selfish and arrogant and that I was a worthless person who needed to beg for forgiveness. I felt my friends and parents knew what I was going through at that very moment and were just waiting to see whether I had the humility to admit to them that all I'd thought and done with my life was completely self-centered and wrong.But then a more terrifying thought came over me: that my whole past life might be fictitious. I thought that all of my memories may have been implanted in me. I was becoming uncertain of everything. My grip on reality was slipping away. I realized I no longer knew who I was or where I was or what was happening to me other than something unspeakably horrible. But I tried to keep reminding myself throughout this that I had just taken four hits of LSD and was just having a bad trip. Yet saying that to myself helped less and less as time went on. It was irrelevant after some time how I had gotten into the state I was in. The hell I was feeling was too real and powerful to pass off as the play of my mind. I felt that the LSD was just bringing to the surface the truth of myself and reality. But I thought if I could just remember what LSD was I could stave off the bad trip. I thought that what LSD was was what LSD stood for, but I could not remember what it stood for. The trip became even more frightening when physical reality had pretty much lost all substantiality. Nothing had any distinct identity. Everything was fluid. There was nothing to get a grip on psychologically. Everything I touched lost all feeling of solidity on contact. I decided I should eat something to help me get a hold of reality. Feeling the solidity of food in my mouth and stomach I thought would help.I took one bite of an energy bar and spit it out. It tasted disgusting. That food could be repulsive further confirmed my idea that life was essentially indifferent and meaningless since negative things were possible. I looked down at the food I had spit out and saw it turned into clumps of writhing maggots. I looked more closely at the spit out food to see that it really wasn't maggots, but I only saw the maggots in greater detail. More fear welled up in me. Now I had further, tangible evidence that reality was a malignant, indifferent, untrustworthy miscreation at its' core. The lusus naturae of all lusus naturaes so that any and everything that could exist in all possible realities was necessarily a deformed, grotesque aberration destined to bear nothing but total chaos and randomness so nothing ultimately made any sense and no perception or interpretation could ultimately be trusted.But beyond the fear of the indifference and meaninglessness of reality I was terrified that the solidity of the world had dissolved. I had to get in touch with something solid, either from the present or past, something that would show they were real and not just figments of my imagination. I opened up my journal to read some of the entries I had written to help confirm to myself that the past I remembered having happened really did happen. I thought that if the thoughts in my mind could be confirmed by something outside of myself it would provide solid evidence of my past and put solid ground back under my feet again, and more so, put solid ground back under my ideas about myself and reality. It would also help confirm my belief that I was having doubts about who I was, and reality in general, because I was on a bad acid trip. But when I opened my journal and started reading I  became afraid to read past the quotes in the beginning of the thinking that if I read some of my personal experiences they would only create a whole other series of worries and doubts.Then I remembered I had my watch, and I remembered that I had taken the LSD at about 1:00 pm. I felt that seeing my watch would give me something very concrete to hold onto. I could check the time and the date, and I knew that if the time was about what I'd expect it to be and the date was what I thought it should be I'd know that I was just having a bad acid trip and that it was only the acid that was causing me to lose my hold on reality. I looked at my watch and the time said 5:48 pm. That was good - about what I expected. And the date was 11 - 18 - 95. Also very good. Those outside facts confirmed my inner thoughts. The watch felt solid and real in my hand. A wave of relief came over me. But then I doubted that what the watch said or that the watch itself was real. I didn't know anything outside of my own thoughts that could prove what the watch said was real and true. I saw what the watch said as part of a lie. I realized I was waking up to the 'Great Lie' - the lie that is past on from generation to generation of humans that the material world is substantial, solid and that our ideas and measurements of it reveal reality. I now saw this was not true. It was clear now that there is never anything to get a hold of and call 'reality'. I realized that everything in my inner experience and in the outer world had no real substance. I realized that nothing could be trusted, that there was no solid truth to hold onto. I looked down at my watch and it melted in my hand. Any substance and weight it had had a moment before was gone. I threw it to the ground in terror.Any and every hellish scenario began to feel possible now. I decided to open myself up to the most bizarre and hellish possibilities. I saw a comfort in realizing that anything could go wrong - then at least I could take comfort in knowing what the truth was: that reality is hell. I decided to see if I could jump through the earth into another dimension. I ran and jumped into the air. It was deeply comforting when my feet landed firmly on the ground. Layers of fear immediately dissipated from my mind. Some of the substantiality of the physical world returned. I felt security in the returning solidity.But it was short-lived. The nausea that I had felt earlier suddenly returned, and much worse. I vomited food and then blood. I was sure I was dying. I knew I had to get back to the farm where I lived or I would die. I put on my boots. I was ready to take off for help when every direction I looked in looked the same. I didn't know which way was the right way. I realized it was dangerous to try to get back to the farm for help since I had no idea which direction was the way back standing there in the middle of the woods.I conceded to the fact that I might just die out there in the woods. But I again reminded myself that I had taken four hits of LSD and that it could just be the bad acid trip that was making me feel that I was dying. Though I didn't find that thought very convincing. I felt that I'd be lost for good and definitely die if I headed off into the woods having no idea if I was headed in the right direction or not. I lied down in my tent trying to accept the fact that I might die out there in woods. Facing immanent death made fear of the meaninglessness of existence and its' insubstantiality pale in comparison. Accepting the fact that I might actually die a deep sobriety came over me. With the sobriety I no longer felt a need to avoid anything, however frightening. A deep desire to face the truth, to face reality, however good or bad it might be, filled my being. I didn't listen to Gregorian chant. I didn't want to try to create any feelings of a good world. I wanted reality to come to me on its own terms. I'd accept whatever it gave me. I moved my butt-cheeks while lying down so I could get more of a sense of my physical being. The world was feeling more tangible. I realized I just needed to be interacting with physical reality, that I needed to be completely living in the here and now, in each and every moment. I noticed that storm-like clouds had formed in the sky. I got up and put my rainfly on my tent. A said out loud what I needed to be doing each step of the way, 'OK, attach the rainfly there. Good. Let's go over here now.' I just wanted to be fully in the present, no matter how mundane it happened to be.I realized that living in the present moment no matter how 'mundane', 'routine', or 'boring' was beautiful compared to the horror acid trip I had just been experiencing. Physical reality, with all its' solidity was slowly coming back into focus. Then the bad trip was completely gone. And without realize it, the good trip wasn't there either. I didn't notice that the feeling of tripping was diminishing. It was now about five hours after consuming the four hits of LSD. Exhausted, but greatly relieved, I went into my tent and lied down.I suddenly came to, and it was like the other times I had lost and regained consciousness. There was no feeling of having fallen asleep. It felt like I had blacked-out and suddenly come to. I spontaneously, without thinking it was strange, or even realizing what I was doing, jumped up and out of the tent. I knelt on the ground and grabbed a fistful of leaves. I pressed them against my face. The bad trip, or any feeling of tripping was completely gone. I hugged a tree. It was solid! Solidity! What a joy! And sounds had substance again. And everything I looked at was hard, firm - solid.It didn't occur to me that it was very unusual for all feelings of tripping to have disappeared only after five hours from taking the acid. I went back into my tent and lied down again, now even more deeply relieved that the trip from hell was over.I suddenly came to again after a lapse of consciousness. Again, I spontaneously jumped out of my tent and knelt down grabbing a fistful of leaves. I stood up realizing that the world felt very different and that I felt very different. It felt as though a burden had been lifted from every cell in my body. My body felt amazingly light, and every movement I made felt effortless and completely natural. Then I realized that my sense of having a personal consciousness was gone. I knew in that moment, beyond any doubt, that I had awaken. I felt that I was in a fairy tale land. Everything felt so close. I could feel the whole universe right there in front of me. It felt like the universe was laughing and clapping and saying, 'Welcome home.' I literally felt that I had awaken from a dream. It truly felt that I had just been born, just, in that moment, truly come to life. I repeated out loud, 'This is so funny' (awakening from taking LSD) and 'This is so incredible.' I looked at the darkening sky and the ground and the trees. Everything looked so soft and light. It seemed that the world had been turned inside out.I realized how meaningful suffering is. If people truly knew that suffering was a natural part of existence then they would attend to their suffering instead of trying to avoid it. Suffering is a reminder that there is something wrong with our perception (understanding) of reality. We need to ask, 'Why do I suffer?' and see that the answer is in the question: because of 'I'. We suffer because of the idea of an 'I' separate from and standing apart and independent from the rest of the universe.I saw so clearly how most humans are still caught in the illusion of separateness, but I no longer saw the irrational acts of humans as evil or tragic. I saw suffering as an essentially natural outcome when reality is not percieved correctly. There was no pity for the human condition, only compassion.I could feel how we all originate from nothing. The best way I could think about it at the time was that we are all crystallized points of eternity. I thought, of course something that is eternal and infinite is going to suffer if it thinks it is something temporal and finite. Thinking you live in a human body is necessarily going to be very suffocating, claustrophobic, when you are, in fact, infinite, which doesn't imply endless space but its' transcendence. My head felt like a void, and I had a feeling of vastness and emptiness up through my stomach, chest, neck and mouth. I loved the sound of my voice. I felt like I was speaking out of a void. Every sound and syllable I made was effortless and sounded perfectly crisp and clear. I realized before that I had always been afraid of my voice.As I tried to think of 'myself' I found it very hard. There was nothing to hold onto. There was no longer any concept that could contain who I now recognized myself to be. I saw that my life as 'Chris M.' had been nothing but a dream. There was nothing substantial about 'Chris M.'. I asked myself, 'Who is Chris M.?' and found I had no idea. He was a dream, an illusion, a mirage. My whole past life felt like a dream that I had just woken-up from. It was hard getting a hold of past memories. Nothing specific came to mind. It didn't bother me in the least. It seemed that I had been dropped off in the woods about a month ago.I thought to myself that it was worth next to an eternity to reach the state I was in. I laughed at all the things people identify themselves with - political causes, religions, their color of skin, nationality, being cool etc. I saw the ridiculousness of so many acts of humans.I thought of my family, and my friends on the farm where I lived, and saw how much I loved them all. I felt that they were right there with me. The earth, the universe, felt so small, as if everything was immediately present. I thought of what I would do next with my life, and I found there was nothing to weigh my thoughts against. Everything I thought of doing was just, 'Yeah, OK, whatever.' There was no seriousness or worry or doubt to my thoughts. It was just, 'whatever I do, I do.'I remember shouting out, 'Hello!' expecting the universe to answer back. I had never felt so incredibly alive. The world had been transformed from a 'serious place' to a place of pure magic and wonder. I just wanted to help others wake up and say, 'See, isn't it awesome and miraculous? See, the world's already perfect.'I felt completely safe and secure and at home. I laughed at the thought that people are actually afraid of being attacked in the woods by another human. Being afraid felt so absurd, so completely unjustified, completely based on an illusion about one's true nature and the true nature of reality.I decided the next morning I'd go back to the farm to be with my friends whom I felt an intense love for. I kind of felt like a father. I wanted to let everyone know that everything is alright, that everything is already perfect.I decided to pack up my stuff right then (it was about 7pm) and go over to see some Boy Scouts whose Scoutmaster I had met earlier in the day and who said I was welcome to come to their campfire that evening. I wanted to share my love, myself, or maybe I should say, lack of self.It was a funny experience trying to make it over to where the Boy Scouts were. I got lost in the dark. I thought that was pretty ironic. Yet it didn't bother me in the least. At one point I was going to start over from where my tentsite had been. I turned around to see if I could trace my way back, and I stumbled over mentally. I realized that I had always had ideas, presumptions about everything. I mentally stumbled over because my mind automatically was trying to hold onto my ideas of where I had been, but a deeper part of me could no longer make the error of mistaking my ideas about reality for reality itself. My perception was no longer obscured, and it was obvious what was reality and what were just my thoughts about reality. So I stared at the ground, and the trees and the earth seemed to be saying to me, 'Well, here we are. We're all the information you need to find your way back. We're reality.' It was a wonderful feeling - to just see the world without it being cluttered up with ideas, opinions, beliefs, presumptions.My fifty pound pack felt like nothing on my back. I hardly noticed it was there. And I hiked up and down the mountain like it was nothing as I tried to find my way to the Boy Scouts. It didn't matter at all that I couldn't find them. Just being alive was an exhilarating experience.Feeling no inhibitions I called out and tried flashing my headlamp in a signal-like fashion. Not living in the normal human realm of separation and fear I didn't think that my actions would be taken as strange by everyone else camping out there in the woods. There were a number of people camping in the area, and people's responses were essentially, 'What the hell are you doing yelling out trying to find somebody in the dark, dude?' I felt such intimacy with the rest of the world that it didn't seem strange to me at all. Well, I finally found my way to the Boy Scouts. Actually, it was the scoutmaster and about eight adults whom I finally came across. I could see that they were wary of me, and the scoutmaster was definitely not the friendly person I had met earlier in the day. I could see they were just checking me out - making sure I wasn't some psychopath or something. To me their behaviour was ridiculous, so unjustified. It was merely based on the illusion of separation. But I only had understanding for their situation. I told them I was coming to join their campfire, and they told me that it had already ended. When I spoke with them I felt awkward speaking in a way that I never had before. I realized after that I felt that way because I had no ideas or expectations or fears deciding what I should and shouldn't say. It was a completely new experience for me. I was really struck by their irrational fear of me based on the false belief of separation. Their behavior seemed almost silly. As they walked away from me talking they seemed like silly cartoon characters going, 'mumble grumble, mumble grumble.'I was now in a clearing up in the mountains at night with the stars overhead. I layed out my sleeping back in the open beneath the stars, a feeling of total freedom, of oneness with all, permeating my being. The temperature was dropping. My body shivered from the cold, but coldness was just coldness, not a 'problem' as I'd normally related to it. I no longer felt any pain in my right knee which had been bothering me for weeks. I lied down in my sleeping bag looking up at the stars. They felt like they were right in front of my face. Everytime I opened my eyes I mentally jumped back at seeing how close the stars were. The mountains also felt very close, and the sound of the wind and trains and voices and other noises felt like they were right next to me. The sights and sounds were perceived without ideas or beliefs or any thoughts coming in the way.The insubstantiality of time and space was completely tangible and obvious. They were still there, but I now saw them as the thinnest of veils lying across the vastness of the void. Possibly the most powerful part of the awakening was that all existential suffering and all existential doubt had ended. I had attained 'Certitude' of certain things as the Zen priest Steve Hagen had spoken about in his book 'How the World Can Be the Way It Is', which I think had had a significant influence on me having this experience. I had read the entire book the previous day, and one of the main themes of the book is trying to prove that there is nothing substantial in the material world, and yet, there it is. He says that the world is filled with paradoxes until we just see things for what they are beyond all conceptualization. I have no doubt that all the ideas in that book were mulling around in my unconscious mind when I took those four hits of acid.Who I was and my 'place' in the world were meaningless questions now. I Knew that I had awaken. I Knew that existential human suffering is based upon an illusion - the illusion of separation. I Knew that what I was could never be harmed. I had no fear of anything. Fear is a product of the separate self. Fear goes hand-in-hand with the feeling of separation. The individual, separate 'I' is fear.Two men came up to me while I was lying in my sleeping bag. They wanted to know if it had been me they'd seen walking along the mountain ridges, or rather, the headlamp that they'd seen. Every word I spoke came out effortlessly. I felt a naturalness and comfortableness in my being that I had never felt before. I felt the infinite in me communing, unaware to the two men, with the infinite in them. It was a joy being with others because I felt no separation with them.Another amazing thing I noticed was seeing that thoughts were no longer a problem. I could easily put aside any thoughts in my mind and just see the world void of any concepts about it. It was such an exhilarating feeling of liberation - there was finally space, boundless space, in my mind.Not long after I had initially woken-up to reality I felt I had realized what LSD is. I felt that it had been created by the collective unconscious of humanity to show humans deeper aspects of reality to help them wake up, ultimately, to the ground of being itself. I thought the same idea about Chaos Theory. I saw that everything is happening to help us wake-up. I saw, without any doubt, that the only useful thing to do in life is to wake-up. All the works of humanity, all technological progress adds up to nothing. The only thing that is of any value is to wake-up to reality.The next morning the voidness in my head and body had greatly diminished. I didn't feel as light, though my voice still seemed to be coming from a void, and objects still felt lighter than 'normal'. I thought that maybe I was already growing use to my new state, but as time went on it was clear that the awakening was fading. Any effects not attributable to memory had faded completely within eighteen hours. It was a let down at first to realize that what I thought had been a permanent awakening  turned out to be temporary. The intense acid trip had been a catalyst for a brief, though extremely powerful transcendence of my mind. I have no doubt that the brief awakening was genuine. LSD can only effect the mind and I had gone beyond my mind. It was like the high dose of LSD I'd taken acted like a rocket ship that broke me free from the gravitational pull of all of my ideas about myself and reality to temporarily wake me up before the powerful karmic pull of my habitual center of gravity in the known, in ideas and beliefs about myself and reality, pulled me back. And then there I was believing I was 'Chris M.' again and huddled in the security of all his ideas about the reality around him - a reality of unfathomable mystery and wonder. But now that mysterious reality was wondered down by concepts to make the world 'safe' and 'secure' for myself.  I am deeply grateful to have had a glimpse, even for a brief period of time, of reality. LSD can show us deeper dimensions of reality. It can take us on trips to subtler levels of consciousness, and in my case, it can even catapult us beyond the mind altogether, though, almost inevitably only temporarily. Only temporarily, because whe have to go through the actual day to day practice of living to let go of all our ideas about reality and ourself to finally stand in total nakedness and vulnerability and humility in the knowledge that who we are and what reality is will always ever be a mystery.Exp Year: 1995ExpID: 56890Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 15, 2007Views: 26,386    LSD (2) : General (1), First Times (2), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Mystical Experiences (9), Nature / Outdoors (23), Multi-Day Experience (13), Personal Preparation (45), Alone (16) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab) 3.0 goralMushrooms - P. cubensis(dried) 9.0 mgoral2C-I(powder / crystals) 1 bowlsmokedCannabis(plant material)It all began as a simple night of rolling at a house party, I ate one green scorpion and snorted a little piece of one. Rolled nicely all night, and smoked plenty of bowls. Met a lot of good folks, including the person I experienced this day trip with. He will be referred to from here on in as J, Me and him got to talking about psychedelics whilst smoking many a bowl of juicy fruit.I mentioned that I had a small amount of 2C-I left, and during the course of the night it was decided that we would split the dose I had left, and he would split a blotter of LSD with me. The night wore on and in the morning we headed back to his house to pick up the dose. When we got there he retrieved his stash, opened it up,and proceeded to give me a full blotter (dancing elephants) and he ate a full one too. While he was digging around in his stash he noticed a bag of mushrooms, pulled them out, and we split the bag, him eating 1 gram, me eating 3 grams and a few chunks. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] We then drove to my house to eat the dose of 2C-I. (NOTE: DO NOT EVER EVER DRIVE ON PSYCHEDELICS,WE WERE STUPID AND WE PAID THE PRICE LATER ON) ate the dose of 9 mg 2C-I per person, and drove to the park to play some disc golf. It was really cold and pretty windy and we were both starting to trip a little bit. So we drove to this other park to go on a nature hike to a spot J knew of, I saw people in ninja costumes running around in a field on the way there. I dropped my cell fone twice getting out of the car, so J (very wisely as you will see later on) suggested I just leave it in the car.We arrived at the nature trail, and the visuals were beginning to get beautiful. The moss on the old archway above the trail was patterning quite heavily, and the leaves on the ground were beginning to form very natural simple fractals. I was beginning to notice letters in the patterns. This would form a central component of the trip later on.We walked for about 10 minutes, went over an awesome bridge over a dry ravine area, and arrived at a ravine with a large log to sit on and smoke a bowl of juicy fruit. In the ravine was a river flowing, and a lot of dead plants. Right across the ravine was a small Indian village(I live in the Midwest) and they had a red mask in a tree, signifying there territory. We sat and smoked a large bowl of juicy fruit, which kicked all 3 parts of the trip into high gear. I couldnĺt tell what was affecting me the most, its like all 3 agents combined to make one super compound in my brain lol.I looked at Jĺs face and it was covered with letters. The trees were all moving, dancing, looked like they were attempting to speak to us. J told me the log we had been sitting on had been carved on by many people,so we stood up to take a look. I have absolutely no idea how many of the letters I saw were actually there, there must have been hundreds of ppl carving into this log. I saw letters deep down into the very skin of the log. layering and changing and always there, I couldnĺt blink them away no matter how hard I tried, it was a complete chaos of language, most of the letters were English, but I caught a few of the pre-modern hieroglyphics that I have seen on dmt before.We decided to continue along the trail to another spot that J has tripped at before. On the way there we notice these leaves on the ground,kind of shaped like a large purple pea pod. As we continue through this area I noticed that the very leaves themselves seemed to be arranged into words. I pointed this out to J and at one point we had to stop and look because we were CONVINCED that the leaves were arranged to communicate with us.We see the cool area off to the side, and leave the trail to go to it. This area is extremely cool, resembles a tree cave. The trees seem to be bending over to form a cave like structure, it is a very cool area in the middle of the day. We walked through this area for a little while, trip getting stronger by the second. I began to feel a presence, like the entire earth was alive. This feeling got more ever present as I began noticing it more and more.At this point we saw the bridge we had walked over earlier, and decided to turn around and head back to the trail. We began to get a little lost, but just kept going with the flow of the trip. I noticed birds around us, and J began to make bird calls. The birds kept appearing out of nowhere, and getting much louder. The birds began to call to other birds far away, sounded like they were communicating ôHey guys come look at these 2ö. When I noticed this I laughed very hard. When I laughed the birds began making very happy cries, sounded JUST like they were laughing back at me. This made me very happy and we continued to communicate with the birds. This is definitely one of the coolest things that has ever happened to me on any psychedelic.We then noticed that we had no idea where we were, so we decided to just follow the birds. We began to get MEGA lost in the woods, and the trip started to turn a little sour for me. It was not scary at this point yet, it would become a lot more so later. The bird led us through a very dead swampy muddy area. As we were walking we noticed that all the trees were dead in this area, no pines, and began to feel the cycle of death that they went through, but they were still alive, just waiting for conditions to be right to explode into beauty again. This touched me very deeply as I have been going through a depressing part of my life recently, being stuck at home a lot and kind of drifting without any purpose in my life. The depression has been affecting every aspect of my life,including my art and writing (I havenĺt been doing much of either lately).Eventually we were out of the marshy area, still following the birds, and the trees began to clear. We then noticed that wow, theres our car. The bird led us RIGHT to our car, we came out of the woods maybe 20 feet from it. We decided to make the short drive to the next park over, to check out what was going on there.(DONĺT DRIVE DONĺT DRIVE DONĺT DRIVE!!!!)We made it to the next park, stopped at a large field, and got out of the car to go check out some cool statues of humans. This area was a large open field and it was all very trippy, visuals everywhere in the sky, that I have not seen the likes of before. Very smooth, well delineated, and crisp fractals, playing off the various colors of tree and sky and ground.As we were walking over the field, a jet plane flew over is, it was EXTREMELY low. The sound and presence of the plane instantly changed the direction of my trip. I began to feel very vulnerable out in the open, and started to freak a little bit. I looked over at J and could see that the plane had done exactly the same thing to him. We decided to drive back to his house. (DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB!!!!!) As the drive wore on, I began to spiral deeper and deeper into a more and more confusing, threatening trip. At 2 distinct points in the drive, once at a stoplight and once while turning, we BOTH heard very strange noises, sounded extremely alien and weird. The first noise I could hear it my head, it definitely wasnĺt coming from outside, and I could also feel it in my mind. It seemed like it was a frequency that was tuning my thoughts to a very strange place. The second noise did the same thing but I donĺt remember much of what it sounded like. The first noise sounded like an old movie sound effect, like an alien spaceship hovering, very spacious and just NOT HUMAN sounding. I know that J heard both of these noises because both times it happened I looked over at him and asked ôDude did you justů.ö And he looked at me with a look of shock on his face and nodded his head.As we drove the trip just started to get to be too much for me to handle. I began to notice evidence of humans fucking up the world all around me. Every house and rock had human faces in it, this was definitely visuals of the same underlying ground as the log at the beginning of the trip. There were many hyper-synchronistic moments throughout this trip. I saw people in trees and the sky and everywhere, not including the people who were actually walking around. The fact that we were driving and we were both tripping our faces off began to really fuck with me, and I know it fucked with J too because he remarked to me ôMan I'm just gonna drop you off at your house, go home and try to sleep this off.ö I agreed very much with him and we FINALLY made it to my house.Here begins the part of my story where I'd be fucked to tell any of you guys anything if I hadnĺt had my video camera on my fone (remember earlier J was VERY WISE for telling me to leave it in the car? I probably would have lost it in the woods) I took 20 15 second videos of myself, between 3:38 pm and 4:07 pm, these videos definitely helped me to put all of this section of the trip into words. I went to my room, got under my blankets (getting my bed muddy as FUCK in the process) and began to try to ride out the crazy mindfuck I had gotten myself into by being in that car.(ONCE AGAIN,NEVER DRIVE ON ANY TRIP!!!)I will now type the notes I made of each video as I was almost completely down from the trip, at about 11 o'clock the same night, and summarize the information at the end, with more notes that I have taken.Video 1,3:38 PM : Light on ceiling, blue to red flashes (I later figured out this was the 3d glasses I was holding over the lens of the camera) turned phone at face for a split second, phone in blankets, I was getting lost in the blanket, it never seemed to end. I pulled and pulled and they just would not END!!! I then decided to get my coat, a very long gray wool trenchcoat that my dad gave to me, I could feel it was soaked in his aura from the years that he wore it, and pull a pen out of my pocket to write some of this down, but I could never find the pen because I got into a major time loop with the jacket, I would pull and pull with both hand and the same parts of the jacket kept coming back in front of me, IDENTICAL sections of the jacket, it freaked me out a little bit. I was able to pull myself out of this loop. But barely.Video 2,3:41 PM : blue to red lights, me breathing heavily and starting to make sounds like I'm attempting to communicate the depths of my extreme psychedelic brutalization. At this point I begin to have no control over my thoughts whatsoever, a chaotic spiral of increasingly unexplainable emotions, mixes of emotions, emotions I donĺt really have a name for. The one that sticks out like a sore thumb is this WILD combination of JOY and unrelenting horrible terror/frightened awe of what I was experiencing. Ying/Yang, creation/destruction, all that duality jazzed got beaten into me with a blunt psychic hammer, I can no longer deny any of that. This was almost too much for my relatively un-seasoned mind to handle.Video 3,3:43 PM : In this video its obvious I was pretty much convulsing, VERY heavy breathing and wildy swung around camera, blankets, walls, ceiling all seen in rapid succession. Near the end of the video I begin to make very odd noises, guttural, definitely unlike any noise I have ever made, almost like growling. I'm pretty sure this was me.Video 4 3:44 : At this point in taking these notes I remember that I was just messing with the effects on my camera and the 3d glasses to try and attempt to communicate this massive surge of sensory overload I was experiencing. Underneath blanket for pretty much duration of video. A quick flash of my face, more noises, I think I'm trying to say words along the lines of ôStick with it. Persevere. Go with the flowöVideo 5 3:47 : Starts with white light, I'm still convulsing, still making guttural noises. A flash of my face, I then say ôOh yeahö in a happy tone of voice. I think this was one of the more down moments of the trip, when I could kind of control my thoughts. At end of video ôIf you can do it, do itö heard very clearly.Videos 6 & 7 Are just the ceiling light.Video 8 3:50 this is one of the only videos I do not remember at all. At this point I could barely tell I was in my room. Begins with blinding white light, waving phone all around, then I hear myself begin to speak audible words, but they are not in English. Thatĺs right kids, I caught myself on video speaking in toungues. The phrase is heard very clearly. It is ôShtellbe Shayga,Gabbada,Gabbada,GANDOö the freakiest part of this is that the second time I say gabbada, there are VERY CLEARLY TWO VOICES SPEAKING!!! Freaky huh?Video 9 3:50 a one second video of the ceiling light. I'm pretty sure at this point I remember me just looking through the lens of the camera, and comparing the visuals on the ceiling to the visuals inside the cameras view of the ceiling, and accidentally hitting the take video button.Video 10 3:53 talking, definitely not all in English, long string of unintelligible gibberish, öGlossolalia will get youö heard very clearly though in the middle of the gibberish phrase.Video 11 3:54 ôhadaseyö and ôungatassassaö heard very clearly.Video 12 3:55 : Me looking at phone steadily, hitting lens with finger.Video 13 3:56 : Me hitting myself in the face with phone, I think I had it in my mouth too.Video 14 3:57 : Me counting along with the timer on the phone, but almost a full second behind. Time has no meaning at this point. I remember looking at the time several times, and being amazed by the complete slowness of it that I was experiencingůdefinitely EXTREME time dilation.Video 15 3:58 : A few random numbers counting along with the time, definitely still almost a full second behind, this one I KNOW I put the phone in my mouth, I see teeth and toungue for a split second.Video 16 3:59 ôGive it as much as you canö, counting, voice sounds VERY WEIRD.Video 17 3:59 : Happy laughter heard, donĺt remember much of this part of the trip.Video 18 4:00 PM : Ceiling light.Video 19 4:05 : Me playing djembe, I'm relatively sober at this point, compared to where I was 15 minutes ago.Video 20 4:07 : More djembe playing, its shittily played but I was trying to convey some sort of underlying life rhythm that was VERY complex that I had my head at this point, will definitely work more on this.Whew, thanks for reading through that if you did. This trip has been one of the most eye opening experiences of my life. I came face to face with the underlying consciousness grid, god, gaian supermind, universal consciousness, whatever you want to call it. I came brutally face to face with it, and I now know that psychedelics must be held in the utmost respect, they can definitely be a brutal mental experience. I donĺt suggest that anyone who is not a serious psychonaut attempt to undertake a trip of this nature, definitely not combining all 3 of these elements until you have had a good amount of experience with the extreme states of each one under your belt, because they multiply upon each other in a most perplexing and overwhelming way. What we did by driving was very stupid, both of us definitely learned to NEVER do that again. Please donĺt bitch at me for driving too much, I do deserve some punishment tho, but I think I got that punishment for the overwhelming fear I felt during the drive.I'm taking the video fone with me everwhere now, it helped me to truly understand some of the concepts I had in my mind mid trip, and to bring back some of that information with me.Have a good day and be careful with your psychedelics.Exp Year: 2005ExpID: 50172Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 26, 2007Views: 15,085    LSD (2), Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66), 2C-I (172) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Mystical Experiences (9), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), Combinations (3) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)Where do we start? In the begining is a good place.  The time, a typical friday night, just three friends hanging out. My and my good friend Sally had been talking about different experiences and drugs we've tried and we decided to drop some acid and experience what that's like together. Sally has a roomate, Jane, who had previously tried other drugs and was also curious about trying it. So we got some and divided it up and ate one and sat down to watch the Wizard of Oz. As we are waiting for our trip to hit us we felt the usual giddiness and started just talking about different feelings and how each was experiencing them. We walked out on to our porch and watched tree's blowing in the wind, and just experienced the beauty of nature when we decided to take one more hit and then go on a drive to a park and chill looking at the stars and be out in nature. This is where our trip really starts.We get out to this park, but the sky is overcast and we can't see any stars at this time. So we just talk about standing in the sand of the volleyball courts and the feeling of the wind and the way lights would just flash out of no where. We decide to drive out to a swamp that had a walking observation deck that went out into the middle of this flat prarie like swamp to view the few stars that had started coming out of the clouds. We get out and start walking out on the obs. deck when we notice one star off in the distance in the exact direction we are walking on the obs. deck. We started pointing and talking about how we were the three wise men heading out to Bethlahem. When we get out we lay down and just experience the small amount of stars that had started coming out. They would explode and echo off of each other. Sally described it as the music videos of Ah-ha where they have the neon lights outlining everything we as they danced. We head back to our car when another car pulls up behind us and starts to freak us out a little bit. We hurry and get out of there and start heading back to the apartment and watch another movie.As we get back we are all sitting in our car not wanting to get out, but feeling as though we need to still be going somewhere. What we later described as what 'tripping' really meant when people first came up with calling it that. We get out of the car but Jane felt like she was trapped in the back seat of the car. We get her out and we walk into the apt. Jane starts having a bad trip, to put it lightly, and starts not being able to grasp what was going on or even realize she is living or tripping.She started crying, then throwing a little fit, laying on the ground kind of spasming, moving around. Then, she starts totally freaking out, talking about how she needs to have someone here that isn't tripping to get her out of the trip. It's hard to explain from here. We get a couple strait sitters with us and try to talk her down, but she keeps screaming and nothing will pacify her. She got so confused about the idea that we had not been pursuing any ultimate goal while we were out on our 'trip'. We try and have her realize real life and what she is doing, like doing something familiar to get her to catch herself and then laugh it off, but she just couldn't grasp it. From here on out it becomes very explicit and personal. Words can't explain what was going through Sally and mine's head or what happened visually. We wanted to feel bad, but couldn't get off of our high of laughing and joking about stuff even while she is screaming. The outcome involved half the apartment complex, a dozen police officers, EMT which had to restrain her and give her some drug that is suppost to cancel all drugs in your system and snap her out of it.We ran off to our little room and experienced what seemed like what the Jews felt like when the gestapo came looking for them. We could hear them asking questions, hearing the radios, EMT's laughing about something that was happening outside. We hid it out until they took her away in a stretcher. She came back four hours later and went strait to her room.We ride out the remainder of our incredible trip talking to eachother about what had just happened and what kind of trouble we were/are (yet to find out) going to be in. We still are trying to remove the image of what we saw, her screams, and just general behavior after she lost it. Overall we feel strange. Not terrified, not happy, but completely strange. Thats about the deepest explanation I can give on that.We're now sitting here, not feeling tired, but feeling confused and awake on the whole situation. There is so much more that could be explained. The happiness we felt was incredible before and even after everything had happened. The laughter, the energy, and yet we still couldn't seem to lose that energy even when the whole world crumbled around us.Thinking back on it, it doesn't seem like a big thing. I would do acid again with Sally in a heartbeat. Jane, that's a definate negative but, I feel like the acid forced some issues up that needed to be brought out in the open. Fair warning to anyone who trips with someone with baggage of extreme sorts. It could turn into something you could have never of dreamed.Exp Year: 2003ExpID: 20941Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Mar 2, 2007Views: 10,057    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Guides / Sitters (39), Overdose (29), Second Hand Report (42), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:5 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:150 lbWell I've had a few different types of acid.  I've had blotter, geltabs, microdots, and liquid.  When I chose to trip, which was maybe once a month, I would consume about 4 hits of liquid on sugar cubes when I went out to a local rave.  I'd had some cool visuals like spotlights hitting the black floor and making it look like it was smoking.  That same night I even went as far as to try to draw the smoke coming off of my cigarette, the patterns created were so incredible.  It was a great time because I was with my girlfriend and other friends.  We were all there to support each other through both the good times and bad.Then over this summer, eight of us piled in a van and were off to the World Electronic Music Festival in Canada.  We had a great ride there.  When we got there, there were some problems with the police there and we ended up having to wait 11 hours to get in, and missed the whole first night of the three day party.Around 8 in the morning, we finally get in and set up the tent.  Right away as we are walking around, someone walks by and asks if I want any acid.  I ask what type and she says spidermans.  Now I'd heard that these were phenomenal, but I had my doubts because I thought that liquid was more potent than blotter.  I ended up buying her last 10 hits in two 5 strips and went over to surprise my girlfriend.  She was extatic.Then the night comes and we're dancing to the sounds of our favorite happy hardcore DJ.  Right after his set, we decided to take all 5 hits we each had and did.  We then walked over and bought a drink, waiting in line about 15 minutes.  It was about another 15 minute walk back to our tent through the mud and the crowd.  We also had bare feet for fun.While we were walking, it hit me like a truck.  I've never experienced anything so potent before.  One minute we were walking, the next it felt as if we had been walking for hours and hours.  As I looked down at the grass in the pale light, it looked as if the dim shadows were rising upwards, as if I was constantly walking uphill.  When I would step forward, I would realize that the ground wasn't a hill at all.  Well, I must have looked ridiculous walking around for a while because my friend laughed at me and told me it looked like I was attempting to walk up huge stairs which weren't there.Then I looked over at my girlfriend who was also staring at the ground, so I knew she was having about the same reaction that I was.  We then decided the visuals were getting a little overwhelming, so we decided to retreat to our tent for a while.  Good thing we had brought an eight-person tent, we had plenty of room to spread out and move around.  We both lied down on the air mattress and began playing with the flashlight there.It had rained earlier in the day and the water had soaked through the top of the tent.  As we shined the flashlight on the glistening streaks of water it looked as if the top of the tent was freezing over and over again.  After this was when things started to get ridiculous.A few friends came back to the tent and we shined the flashlight on them as the talked.  I was getting trails upon trails upon trails at this point.  Their mouths and heads were moving hundreds of times after they were done speaking.  The words made no sense. I had to get out of there, so I got up and went on a solo journey.I walked over toward the main progressive trance stage.  At the time I think the DJ Geezer was playing, who is obviously very old.  The stage had lights all around it which ranged all the way from light pink to dark blue.  I somehow moved way up to the front trying to ignore peoples obvious stares.  It made me afraid.When I got up to to my position right near the front, I looked up and Geezer was up on a high pedestal and to me from my position and state of mind looked like God.  That's when my ears just went.  It was strange, the sounds seemed to make no sense to me anymore.  All that I could hear was bass about 80Hz and below, and high tones over about 10000Hz.  The middle tones sounded blurred together like one of those records with a hidden satanic message if spun backwards.  It was like a wave of roaring and blurred sounds, which started to drive me to the point of insanity.Then I had to make my way back to the tent.  Of course I got lost and ended up wandering around for a while.  Some people tried to talk to me, but their words made no sense.  It was all that demonic whirling sound with constant bass hits and highs.  I was really losing it at this point.  I looked over at the trees in the distance and it looked like I was not only in some sort of movie, but it looked like the branches were appearing and twisting and bending sideways.  The sight was ridiculous, It looked like some sort of hurricane.  Everything had this sort of lquid looking substance around it because of the extreme trails I was getting.Next thing I knew I had made it to the porta-potties near my tent and decided it was a good time to go to the bathroom.  I walk in to the bathroom and lock the door.  I go to the bathroom and as I'm going I stare down into the pitch blackness.  Suddenly whiteish-purple stars which resemble neurons begin to appear all around me.  I felt like I was frozen in place.  I couldn't move, they were everywhere.  I stood there for wat felt like an eterninty.Then I heard a knock at the door which startled me and I opened it up and stepped out.  I saw what resembled my tent in the disance and began to walk that way.  I realized it was my tent and began to walk faster when I then tripped over someone elses tie for their tent.  I felt the fall in extreme slow motion.  It felt like I was flying just above the grass.  Then I came down on my face.  I got up and took a couple of steps toward my tent and I was there.I went in and sat down next to a couple of friends who could tell right away something was wrong with me.  I couldn't comprehend what was going on.  I waved my hand in front of me to keep them away and I saw 100 hands following it.  My trails were ridiculous and everything was movie-like.  I tried to close my eyes and all I saw were patterns of flowing color, like a tunnel with patterns on the walls all around me.  I then forced myself to lie down and wouldn't let anyone talk to me or touch me.I fell asleep for a while.  It was a strange light sleep.  I kept imagining I was in other places, like small scenarios were playing in my head.  It was like short movie clips of a strange variety over and over.  I then awoke when my girlfriend got back and she got me to come out and see the sunrise.  It was one of the most beautiful things that I had ever experienced.My trip had gone from the worst ever to amazing while I watched the sun come up.  It turned me all bright and cheerful.  I greeted people as they walked by.  I carried on some long conversations which I don't remember the topics of.To me this night was a turning point in my life.  When the trip turned bad, it made me sit back and look at my inner self.  I realized the strong points and flaws of myself.  I thought about my girlfriend and friends there with me and my realtionships with them.  I contemplated life in general, my past, present, and future.  While this trip was a bad experience for a while, I think that it wholistically turned out as an eye opnener for me.  Since then, I've been more tolerant of people.  I've appreciated nature so much more.  And I have a more positive outlook on life in general.If you have read this whole thing, which I realize is rather lengthy, I'd like to thank you for taking a few minutes to read about my experience.  I hope that I have painted a good enough picture for you so that you can almost see the experience through my eyes.  Thanks again.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 10435Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Mar 8, 2007Views: 7,252    LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Festival / Lg. Crowd (24) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)   smokedCannabis(plant material) 1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab) 1 tabletoralMDMA(ground / crushed)BODY WEIGHT:185 lbI'm 18 years old and I have experienced and taken many different kinds of drugs in my life and have had some wonderful experiences overall. I've smoked pot for a few years, taken all kinds of pills, mushrooms, XTC, nitrous oxide, and snorted coke even... NOTHING could prepare me for the nightmare I was about to experience that night.I had wanted to try Acid for a long time. I had heard all sorts of 'enlightening' experiences from my friends. I had heard stories about seeing crazy visions, colors, beautiful things, and so on. I figured I'd give it a try sometime or another just to see what all the fuss was about. My parents decided to go away on a trip for two days so they left me by myself to watch our pets. I called around and was finally able to find some Acid the night before they were coming home. After waiting for hours, I got a call from my friend (I'll call him J) saying he was going to go pick it up from the dealer for me. When he finally arrived, he and his friend (I'll call him D) came in with not only 3 hits of Acid, but also some crushed powder XTC that came wrapped in a small bag. The Acid came on three very small pieces of thin paper with the faces of the band Gorillaz on them. It was also wrapped in alluminum foil for protection.I took my first hit of Acid with J and he took his one hit too around 1:30 in the morning. J wasn't very excited because he had taken Acid many times before and had told me it did nothing to him. After waiting a while, I started to notice things more. The first thing I noticed was how detailed the carpet was. The designs seemed to go on forever and the patterns became much sharper and more detailed than ever before. While J and D were talking, I lay down on the sofa and stared up at the ceiling fan. I noticed the strangest thing about it--these little diamonds appeared around the fan blades and began to almost melt onto the ceiling in a green, liquid type form. I thought this was extremely cool, but J and D didn't seem to care.After some time passed, we went outside to smoke some Pot that D had brought with him. I had a pretty good amount of it, and it was fairly good stuff so I was fairly high when we were done which didn't really seem to do anything to the Acid effects at all.We decided to go upstairs and relax for a little while in the room where our computer is. We moved our small TV up to that room and put on some movies to help pass the time. I took my second hit of Acid around that time during one of the movies. I waited a while and still did not notice anything different other than the lights on the ceiling and the patterns on the carpet from before in the living room. Feeling let down, J gave me the XTC powder and told me I'd enjoy that much more. I took the powder which was very gross and just figured the Acid was fake and we'd been ripped off. The dealer wasn't very trustworthy anyway according to many people so I figured we had either gotten some very weak Acid or it was completely fake. I waited some more time and then began to feel the familar effects of XTC kick in. By this time, J and D were bored and tired and decided to leave. BIG MISTAKE! I came upstairs after they left (by now it was close to 4 a.m.) and decided to just enjoy listening to music at full volume and roll on the XTC until it wore off and I could go to sleep. Then it happened. The first thing I began to notice was that the mouse on the computer had trails on it (some people call these tracers) and it was like the mouse was moving in slow motion. The next thing I remember was that I looked over down the upstairs hallway at the smoke detector and saw it melt right off the wall! I looked again and it was there again as if nothing had happened. The Acid was DEFINITELY real, and I at the time was thrilled.I looked at the knobs on the computer speakers and they started to throb and pulse, like a heart beating almost. I looked over at some of the posters we have in the room near the computer. One of them was a picture of a street in Germany with a castle tower and vines growing in the corner of the picture. I remember seeing the vines crawling out of the picture towards me. The tower looked three dimensional, as if I could reach out and grab it and also the people in the picture began to walk but were standing still at the same time. I looked at the clouds in the sky of the picture and a face formed in the cloud and smiled at me. I felt very strange all over at the same time. Part of me was enjoying how nice everything was to the touch (the computer chair, the desk, the pillow I was holding, etc.). I looked over at another picture and saw similar effects. This time, it was a photo of a castle somewhere in Europe. The snow on the towers of the castle seemed to move and form around the towers as if it was snowing that very second. The lights on the inside of the castle seemed to brighten as well. I picked up an old poster my sister used to have on her wall that said 'believe your dreams' and I most definitely was at that point because the Unicorn in the picture started moving and the girly looking rainbow starting glowing along with the letters.I sat in that room for what felt like ages, when really it was only about 10 minutes. I played some of the weirdest techno/electronic music, which really enhanced my overall mood and caused me to imagine some bizarre things that made no sense (I really can't remember what they were). It was at least 5 a.m. by this point and the sun was beginning to come up. I remember looking out the window and seeing the tree by the window changing as if it was rapidly aging. It looked very animated, as if it was in a cartoon. It started to wilt and melt as if it was liquid and very fragile at the same time and I noticed that the lines on the leaves were much sharper and drawn out.This was about the time the bad started happening. I went in the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror. I completely flipped out at this point because I noticed that my skin seemed to be changing colors somehow and I saw another image of myself standing right behind me. My eyes were so dilated that they looked completely black and I looked like I was vibrating. This scared me, so I decided to lie down and listen to more music. This didn't help and only managed to scare me even worse. I called J on the phone and woke him up and asked him for help. I talked to him for what seemed like hours about stupid things that made no sense. He tried to calm me down and sounded pissed off that I woke him up.I calmed down a little bit but I was still freaking out at everything in my room. All my posters were changing and coming to life. The people in one of them started moving and shaking their heads at me. In another one of them, the faces started changing colors and shades. The last one was a drawing of London at night, and I noticed that the hands on Big Ben seemed to be moving. This may not sound that bad, but remember my parents were coming home not too long from then and I could not fall asleep no matter how hard I tried. I even took a hot shower, but I was so numb from the XTC that I couldn't even feel the warmth of the water on my body. It was very unpleasant despite what many people had said about taking showers while rolling.The dealer's friend said that Acid only lasted six hours at the longest. Everybody who had taken that before had only had six hour trips so I was freaking out already because it was at least 9 a.m. and they would be home soon. By this point and I was tripping VERY hard. I became extremely scared and started hearing scary vibrations and echoes throughout my house. Everytime I moved my hands, I had a series of trails/tracers following it. I decided to call the dealer's friend on the phone and after much confusion in finding his number and trying extremely hard to dial it, I managed to somehow. We talked for a while and he sounded alarmed that I was all by myself. He tried to calm me down and after a while of talking to him, I was able to finally calm down again.We got off the phone and things got even worse. At this point I was desperately thirsty and was drinking lots of water and sweating like crazy in fear. I don't even know what I was so scared of, I was just extremely terrified at this point. Maybe it was the sounds in my house, or that my hands and arms were vibrating everytime I looked down at them. My arm hairs started to grow and wrap around my arms. I tried calling several of my friends, but nobody answered. I finally called some of my old friends who live far away who had just helped one of their friends out of a bad acid trip and told them what was happening and what I'd taken.At this point, I was screaming for help. I was in tears because I was so scared. I thought I was dying, I felt like my whole body was shutting down. I went into spells of feeling extremely cold and then extremely hot. She talked to me for a while and calmed me down somehow a little bit. By now though, I was very very scared. My heart was beating so fast it sounded like a machinegun in my ears. I was shaking all over, wrapped up in blankets crying. I felt so pathetic and so helpless in that state and most of all, terrified. I have never been so scared in my entire life. I honestly thought I was dying.She kept telling me I was going to be okay and that I was just imagining it, but I wasn't imagining the physical things like the horrible horrible pains in my stomach and the terrible pain in my back. I felt sick to my stomach and wanted to throw up so bad, but I couldn't. I knew I had too much, I could feel it in my body. The XTC and Acid combined was way too much for my body to handle. I even prayed to God, I said a long long prayer asking him for help and forgiveness for what I'd done. I did not want to die, not like that. I remember I kept looking at the time and would continue to freak out because only a minute or two had passed by when it seemed like hours had gone by. Things got even worse...I looked up at another poster of mine of the computer game Doom 3, and the demon in the picture turned into some kind of spider and crawled out of the picture and lashed his jaws at me. I was terrified and my friend and her dad were trying so hard to help calm me down but it was no use.As if things couldn't get any worse, my parents walked in the door downstairs. I started yelling for help. My mom started freaking out, hung the phone up on my friend and her dad, and called 911. My dad yelled at her for doing it and then yelled at me for being so stupid. I was hysterically crying, begging them not to call the cops and have me arrested. I knew I needed to get to a hospital or I was going to die. I was so thirsty I felt like I was in a desert because my mouth felt as dry as sandpaper. My heart was beating so fast it felt like it was about to jump out of my chest. It was so bright outside I couldn't keep my eyes open. My parents drove me to the ER and all I remember is begging them to forgive me and that I would never do drugs ever again if I survived. A few times during the ride, I felt my chest tighten up and thought I was having a heart attack but then it stopped. The next few hours I spent in the ER, and I don't remember what happened except everything was extremely blurry and there were lots of noises all around me and people running around. When I came to, I was still hallucinating but I felt a lot better. The one thing that did still scare me was my Mom's face because everytime I tried to look at her, her whole face would begin to melt and her facial expressions would twist into awful, orge like impressions. I also remember looking at some of the charts in the ER room and watching them change and become animated and saw bugs crawling all over the ceiling that my Mom told me weren't really there. We finally left and I remember how ashamed I felt and freaked out at how the lines on the road seemed to blend together and that every car had trails following it down the road. I was still scared, but at least I didn't die. The doctors in the ER told me I was severely dehydrated.I will never again do any drugs. Acid changed my life. I am very thankful that I survived that nightmare.Exp Year: 2006ExpID: 53947Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Apr 19, 2007Views: 63,836    LSD (2) : Alone (16), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Health Problems (27), Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3), First Times (2) DOSE:6 hitssublingualLSD(blotter / tab)   smokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:85 kgHmmmm where does one begin. T_T Valentines day this year, sitting at a mates house, 4 of us, waiting eagerly for our sheet of crunchy yumess to arrive, smoking bowls all morning. Finally arrives at about 12ish, after the mad grab and snatch is over I rip off 6 and slide them under my tounge. I quickly rush outside to down a few more cones before it was fruitless.After the aniexty chills start to run up my neck I retreat back inside to watch some tv as the amazingly bitter taste in my mouth starts to intensify. We have had these tabs before, and I had experimented with them a plenty after end of school exams, so I had a good idea in my mind what to expect from 6 at once. The problem was, I was horribly wrong, it soon became apparent to me that thinking I could calculate how high I would get was fucking retarded, as acid is acid.Still watching Tv about 45 min in, my jaw felt as if it was being streched from my mouth to the ground. This then started to turn into excrutiable pain and I swallowed them. My 3 friends who had taken 1, 2, 3 tabs respectively were starting to notice I was beginning to come up and started joking around to calm me down, this worked a little, then I went and layed down on the floor on my side as my jaw felt too heavy to stand anymore.Lieing on the ground my trip suddenly lurched into full gear, and the world started to warp all around me though I was quite comfortable. If any of you know the cover art for the tool album lateralus my vision was surroned with those eye like drawings that are continually joined up, this flowed right around me and seemed to be intergrated into everything I saw. My mates at this time were playing need for speed:most wanted for some reason. It was at this point the synaesthesia kicked in and and instead of feeling the carpet my head was rubbing against I was hearing roars from some sought of animal. I cant remember how long I was actually content lying there, but it was interupted by everyone wanting to listen to music instantaneously, so we all got up and began searching for something to listen to.From this point on all information is from what I remembered from the day, what I have remembered from then to now, what other people have told me, and from flashbacks, this is my story,It was probably only a couple of seconds before I forgot what I was doing and was just randomly walking around the house backwords and forth watching everyone pass me, everyone laughing. No matter where I seemed to go, there always seemed to be a path for me to walk down, even though I was certain the way I was going would lead to a dead end. This felt like it went on for about an hour, but I had absoutely no caring on the matter, till it dawned to me that this was the only thing I could remember doing for a very long time. I suddenly got VERY scared. But I could not stop walking, I went faster and faster, and I could of swore I was just continually going in a straight line with my friends just passing by me, smiling, muttering something that when I tried to listen to just sounded like jibberish.I set a goal for myself to get away from everyone and lie down, eventually I found the bunk beds in the lower room and just crashed there, for how long I was there before I was disturbed I dont know. The next part of the trip I remember very little of probably because nothing life threatening happened, as I just stayed in this room, lying on the ground, coming down a bit from the first peak talking to a sober friend who had just joined us. All I remember was talking about past trips while fucking, and that his face looked like ned flanders did after homer ate insanity peppers. As I started to peak again, I totally forgot I was on acid and asked apperently the same question over and over,'Guys I feel weird. What the fuck have we done. Were on drugs arent we''yes 12''What are we on''LSD''What's LSD''The thing that makes you go mmmmmmmmmmm'This was the only conversation that I had with my friends, repeated exactly the same way time and time again, as I tripped around in my own world happily and oblviously. For some reason, I'm not quite sure, the visuals died down a bit, but the mental aspect of the trip kicked up about 50 notches. I forgot who I was, where I was, How any human functions worked (eating, breathing, fridges). Its hard to desribe how I felt, but it was a mixture of fear, total confusion and acceptance.Now what I have failed to mention up to this point, is that my girlfriend broke up with me the week before, whom I was dearly attached to for a plethora of reasons, but thats another story. And for the first time of the day I started to dwell on it. Why I could remember this and not who, what, why, where is still a mystery to me. As analytical thoughts go on acid, I started to feel pretty shit and walked into the bottom room which turned into a completle different offplanet mining cave as soon as I entered, I really didn't give a shit though, and I jus sat there and went into the 'acid zone' where I just totally drifted away from my body and just thought about the world, life, existence, purpose etc etc.Somehow, and piece by piece is revealved to me everyday, I mapped from me losing my girlfriend, to the purpose of the universe, in one big circle, and as it clicked I was separted COMPLETELY from my body to what I thought was 'gods view' at the time, where I was watching humanity, thinking omfg what a pathetic existence, this made me then turn around to myself and anaylse my own existence, realising that everything I did was completely futile and the only thing that ever made me happy was my girlfriend.At this point, my removed self as god, removed itself from my removed self, and started to talk to me, spilling its guts about how the universe is just a joke, and that we are all just meanigless spotches when looked at from a 'proper' other worldy viewing. I asked him what he meant, he just smiled and then everything got very fast all of a sudden and I was pulled back into a swirl of colours then black.When I regained conciousness, I had abosutely no memory of what had just transpiered, that I had taken any drugs that day, and I 100% believed that I was dreaming. I laughed to myself at how vivid my dream was and walked outside to be amazed at how detailed everything was, and that my friends were here in my dream too. I suddendly got the urge to put 'consume things' I dont think it was hunger, but I just wanted to put things in me. The problem was I had no idea how, blaming this on the dream, I tried to digest a cone with my mind, slamming my head into a frozen meat pie, consequently running around madly as I couldnt understand why I couldnt fix the increasing urge to consume that I was feeling.My friends at this stage made the logical assumption that I was 100% off my head and that I was to be watched no matter what. Somehow I got away from them, and started to make coco pops as soon as my friend (whos house it was) came into the kitchen, I got 1 frame of knowledge, I guess you could call it, of what knowledge was bestowed upon to me in my god to god talk. The scene that then progressed, of my friend telling me off for spilling coco pops everywhere, was already in the back of my head (so I thought) and that I was playing out word for word for what I thought. This scared the living shit out of me, as random images flashed into my head of what had transpired.Was this a dream? What was happening? How did I just know exactly what was about to happen? Freaked I ran out the door with my friends fresh on my heels, I forgot all about what had just occoured, and we walked to another mates house for a change of scenery. Upon ariving there, I remembered what just happened, tipped out all the water they were trying to use to fill the bong for some reason, and just piss bolted, according to them, faster then anything they have ever seen before, off into town.'I'm dreaming, I must be dreaming, this is all just a stupid dream.' To prove this to myself I walked into 7/11 and stole candy bars and just walked out eating them, totally ignoring the people shouting behind me. I then walked down to the corner store and stole an icecream, upon which the owner confronted me, and in a very life like manner told me off. This then threw me off, as the thought of 'This isn't a dream.' creeped into my head.I ran to the train station, hoping to catch a train home, as home I guess symbolies some thought of saftey. I thought I could give the dream testing one more go, by randomly grabbing some chick and making out with her. Luckily the surrealness of everything around me, and the chick next to me, looking at me as if I was some drugged out kid =p, convinced me otherwise. I took the train, making very careful not to miss my stop, because just like in a dream, life seems to be stopped and moving all at once.Once I got to the train station I SPRINTED the 3km uphill to my house, where again, I was convinced I was dreaming, my brother was home. But then it happened. I saw the time, I saw what was on T.V. and realised that in no way this could be a dream, at this moment the whole day just came crashing back onto me. In a paniced rush I rang my ex, I have no idea why, and as soon as she picked up, just like the cocopops, I felt as if every word she said, every noiance in her voice I knew. Then it clicked.The universe stopped moving, and started to revolve around me, and every single event that happened, is happening and will happen was thrust into my brain. The pain of this was completely un imaginable, I hit the deck holding my head trying not to scream. The visuals at this point had all but subsided. After I got up, I 'watched' the universe move forward while I remained 'still' in time, space whatever. The depression/dread/w.e that hit me cannot be put into words. Life is scripted, I have all the knowledge of it, hence life is pointless to live.I looked at my family, put on my shoes and walked out onto the road, cursing everyone for there ignorance, those fucking lucky fools. I had to die. I felt there was no choice in the matter whatso ever, living with this kind of feeling was not even a remote option in my head. I looked for a high ledge to jump off found none, a car turned the corner, I sat, watched, till it came just close, ran and jumped sideways into it. No thoughts, no flashbacks of my life, my brain draw a complete naught, as the car hit and I blacked out.I regained conciousness, I'm guessing 10 min in, as the ambulance was next to me and people were standing all around me, I looked to the side of me and saw that I was lying in a pool of my own blood, my knee looked as if it had been shatted. I felt 0 pain. I had 0 thouhts. I was taken to the hospital, were it wasn't till I was actually in intensive care till I finally thought something which was 'Fuck, as soon as I get out of here, I'll need to find something tall to jump off.'A psych eventually came up to me and asked me to go over what had happened, and I told him pretty much everything. But then I thought to myself. No. That was a grave mistake. If life is scripted, and I lived, then I must of lived for a reason. This, I figured, is why no one can ever know the meanning of life, as once they know it, it drives them to suicide.He then got on the phone and started to talk to someone. I thought I overheard him talking to some dude about how I was the one they had been looking for. The only thing that I thought he could be on about, was that I was the chosen one, that all knowledge of the universe was stored on my brain and that people were going to come in the night capture me, and use my brain as a means to take total control of the world, thus throwing it into total choas.If that day I felt the saddest anyone could ever be, that night I felt more scared then anyone could ever be. I sat in my room, with a screw I had winded out of the drawers next to me in one hand, waiting to stab the person in the face that was going to come and get me in the middle of the night. The problem was I also had no sleep the night before. Yet I stayed awake all night, the mins ticking by as if they were hours, freaking out of my fucking mind, till morning finnaly came and I was completly sober.The outcome was a broken back, as well as my back being cut to shit (I have the most intense scarring), but my knee was fine, just bloodied. This event has totally changed my life and the way I think, it triggered mutiple mental disorders, and for at least 30 min everyday, I become completely detached from reality and just anaylse it like I do on acid. Everytime I think of my ex, or see her I get flashbacks that 1 out of 3 times cause me to vomit. The only positive thing I have gained out of this is a profound understanding of people, life and how they work, despite not feeling human myself.I could of put alot more into this, but its hard to remember it all at once, bits and pieces come to me randomly.Despite all this I still went raving three days later and candy flipped.And that was Valentines day 200612Exp Year: 2006ExpID: 53518Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Apr 20, 2007Views: 12,213    LSD (2) : Various (28), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Relationships (44), Post Trip Problems (8), Overdose (29), Health Problems (27), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:80 mg Ketamine 160 ug LSDBODY WEIGHT:200 lbOne of the most frightening experiences of my life. It felt like my mind was being torn apart and nearly going into the K-hole was the worst feeling ever. I felt as though I was on much more LSD then I actually was and once the effects of the Ketamine began to subside I was sure I had suffered mental damage, but once I came down completely off both drugs I felt much better. Also sleeping was more difficult then usual.I'm not sure if I'd recomend anyone trying this combination but if you decide to, prepare yourself and keep it to a very small group of people that you know well. Make sure you do not have a weak mind, feeling like I have suffered serious mental damage is pretty scary.Exp Year: 2007ExpID: 62646Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Apr 30, 2007Views: 15,878    Ketamine (31), LSD (2) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Unknown Context (20) DOSE:9 glassesoralAlcohol - Beer/Wine(liquid) 4 joints/cigssmokedCannabis(plant material) 1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:82 kgSetI have quite a sensitive mind to chemicals. If I don't maintain a tolerance level for alcohol it can drop to the point where one beer will have a noticeable effect, to get stoned I only need a few drags. My previous encounter with LSD was one dud hit a few years back which effected me more then anyone else.I was back in my home town after a few months away. I had moved to another city where I was busy failing college. I had not maintained a tolerance level for alcohol. I was depressed. In the new city I had found it difficult to make friends I could relax with because my previous friends and I had built one of those internal logic systems of humour and unspoken philosophy without branching out enough. In the new city I had become introspective with too much time and too much Spliff. Smoking Spliff was making me paranoid. My life had fallen into rituals of image maintainance - fake smiles and laughter. A shit life. I fucking hate fake smiles. When I got back I couldn't click with my old friends, things had changed, cocaine had come into the group and they didn't want me to know about it. I got an immediate inferiority complex and started shutting down. I got a stiff-in-my-joints-while-sitting-because-movement-might-betray-my-awkwardness kind of awkwardness. Also, I was feeling guilty for going off to visit my friends without really saying hello to my family.We were parked at some arb place in the city and there was to be a party at an old friends house which I found myself dreading. Why can't I enjoy this like I'm supposed to? What the fuck is wrong with me? I thought constantly. I was passed beer in a quart and I found myself getting embarrasingly drunk. I was constantly relating what I was actually doing and saying to what I should've been doing and saying, like some one would ask me a question and I would mumble something inane, the person would move on to find a better vibe quite quickly and I would be left thinking about what I could've and should've said etc. Not a state in which to smoke a Spliff but when it came around I could not face the task of explaining why I didn't want any. I got bad stoned. It was one of the coldest days I had ever felt too so I was shivering like a bastard. I got some depressing news that the friend we were going to see was now into herion.SettingWe got to the friends house whose parents were away, his buddies from college and assorted people were there. Our group was a deep house cocaine good vibey loving type of people (and me), there was a harcore tattoo tribal piercing heavy metal type group, and a few yuppie celine dion liking music is not of much importance type group. And some what might be called dirty hippies I guess, I think they were junkies. I feel I was way too analytical in noting these distinctions, but I was in that frame of mind, trying to quantify, understand, reduce. I bumbled through hellos sat awkwardly and then wump, LSD. 'Hey dude do you have 80 bucks? (South African Rands) It's a bit expensive but the dude has some Hoffmans. They're fucking strong.''Uh, yeah.' I said and gave the money. I looked at it, put it in my mouth and swallowed it down with beer. After I’d swallowed I realised I would much rather be far away from those people, in a bath, reading some really nice book. Escapist thinking. It came on quite quickly, within twenty minutes I was feeling it, and an hour later I was completely wrecked. Everything I wanted to escape from had a crotch which was rubbed in my face.EqualsI realised I was going to die. The nakedness of the realisation was total, no abstraction whatsoever. You Are Going To Die One Day. It might as well have been within the hour. I saw all my internal organs sitting inside where I still harboured childish notions of internal structure. No, You Are A Pile Of Guts. GUTS? I thought. I HAVE GUTS INSIDE ME??My internal organs were there right under a thin flat of skin. This freaked me out. These Guts Will Rot One Day. Fuck. My friends were laughing, delighting in the wonder around them while I was a million miles away. My Mom Will Die Before Me And Rot. Fuck. Your Body. My fucking body will die? Dead? Me? What the fuck am I? What The Fuck Am I? I just didn’t have a clue. I tried escaping to the bathroom. Oh God the mirror in the bathroom. I didn't see myself in the mirror at all, nothing of me was there. No familiar face that I’ve seen each day without concern. How I was moving this was a mystery. It was horror. This covering, thin thin thin covering of skin. And that dripping red flesh moulded onto a white bone skull. A knife could easily peel that away. (I just want to point out that there was no danger of me harming myself even though I was completely wrecked on LSD. I’m quite positive of it.) The physics of being able to peel your face off easily are obvious, but I realised the full implications of this possibility. You Can Physically Dismantle a Human Body Into Various Parts. What?? And digging through the pile of guts, 'where are you?' would reveal no little silver glowing orb that was consciousness or spirit. I realised that right that very second someones body was being sliced open by a murderer. Someone was being eaten alive by a wild animal, face ripping off, the thing fucking roaring with as it does it. No Mercy. Although I don’t know if it was anywhere near the real horror, I couldn’t imagine feeling any worse if I was watching a mauling first hand. Maybe the difference was duration, I would get flashes of the total feeling that I was somewhat able to recoil from.I got back to the crowd and they’d moved outside into the freezing cold. My fear of opening up and talking kept all my unfolding revelations inside, and from the outside I suppose I was just a strange person who was completely off his face and worried looking but otherwise calm. My eyes were probably looking in two different directions. I didn't want life, I didn't want to be stuck in this sensitive pile of guts. Who the fuck would stick you in a pile of guts and leave you to rot away? What sick joke was this? Then my heart dropped, it suddenly hit me that it's entirely possible that we are a mistake. That human consciousness is anomolous, evolution fucking up. For thousands and thousands of years no one has been able to conclusively prove otherwise. God? The word was a noise the mouth makes with air and gristle. Religion could simply have evolved through natural selection to keep humans sane and motivated to the end of their lives. What a sick joke. What a legacy. Stuck in a pile of rotting guts to die. WHY? What If I Didn’t Want This? Where Is The Choice?Everything was life or death and my friends were giggling and opening things and eating things, I felt nothing for them, no love. Visuals were constant but they were meaningless. The cloudy night sky was a misty inner dome of a dark cathedral with hundreds of carved gargoyles staring out of the gloom. Friends faces were simultaneous layers of skin, flesh and bone. I saw piles of guts, stomachs, livers, breathing lungs under rib cages. I lost the abstractions. Spines jutted from the back of jerseys and elbows were just protrusions of the underlying skeleton. Thin paper skin covering these. It seemed everyone was just ignoring these obvious betrayals. 'High cheek bones' and 'beautiful knees' but they are just skin covering bone. I stared at my hands and they freaked me out, they were pads. If we had three fingers since memory then we wouldn’t think anything of it, I began seeing everyone with three fingers. Thankfully it all faded after eternity.Personal ThoughtsThis analogy just came to me: An uncontrolled release of pressure is an explosion. Which damages the vessel. Fuck. But a controlled release can be entirely beneficial…I think these kind of experiences are necessary for a person, even the negative ones. But I think mine was too much at the wrong time. In my opinion it should not be dick around stuff, but a controlled and regulated event. It just makes so much sense to me. Naked blasts of truth and there isn’t a religious use for it? Please. Because what happened to me was too much of a burn, I’m now pretty much scared shitless of facing any truth again, I’ve gone back to my escapist ways. What I propose to myself is a sorting out of my mental negativities, face my fears etc. and then try LSD or some substance again with a braver outlook. If I can crack that then I will write up on the glory, which I’m sure exists in equal quantities as the hell but I’m yet to experience it fully. I’ve had glimpses on odd Spliff revelations, but nothing full on convincing. I need to be convinced. Faith based religion does not really work for me, so I need to find a person who has gone into these experiences and come out with some kind of map towards compassion, who has some kind of useful systems/techniques in place and who treats these events with utmost reverence and respect. Because to not feel love for my friends was fucking aweful. (I see this as a five to ten year plan, nothing to be taken lightly. My soul on the line type of thing.)Although this blasted me into an existential nightmare with lingering effects and what it uncovered has not been covered over again, I think it’s better I deal with it now than perhaps after I die? There where there might be less footholds to return to. Though it was the cause, I don’t think LSD was to blame for the bad experience, it just accelerated and amplified what was naturally residing in my psychology. Thanks for letting me share this, it has helped me. I never realised how bad it actually was.Exp Year: 2003ExpID: 60828Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: May 6, 2007Views: 27,855    LSD (2) : Large Group (10+) (19), Relationships (44), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:  repeatedoralAlcohol(liquid) 3 tabletsoralMDMA(pill / tablet)   repeatedsmokedCannabis(plant material) 2 dropsoralLSD(liquid)BODY WEIGHT:180 lbI'm not sure if I'm writing this to clear my own head, but I hope someone will find it useful. I'm sorry if it's not good news to some people but it's the truth and I have to tell it.I was going to a mate's club with 4 friends. It was the biggest event the club had hosted and everyone was up for a great night, whatever that might involve. We started drinking at about 6pm and didn't enter the club till it opened at midnight, we were all drunk but not overly so. I took on the role of pill sourcer (as usual) and within a short while managed to get about 3 ecstasy tablets for each of us. I took my 3 between about 1am and 5am when the club closed. I've taken a lot more than this before and was by no means totally fucked, I helped my mate and the djs pack there stuff up before heading out of the club. We all then headed off to someone's flat for the aftershow party that had been planned.Once there I had one grass spliff just to bring me back to ground a little and a line of speed to stop me falling off to sleep on the couch (I had been working all day!). More drink was involved and the morning was partied away by all, including all the club's djs that had showed up. At some point, I'm not sure of the exact time but it must have been about 10am, someone gave me and about 6 others some LSD. It was just 2 drops on the back of my hand that I licked off. At this point I must say that I've never touched acid in my life. I've taken mushrooms plenty times before, but I've never been a fan of halucinogenics and of feeling at all out of control, I've taken practically every non-halucinogenic pill, powder or weed at some point and all without a second thought, but not acid.Anyway, I don't remember any slow start or build up, I just carried on with the party, chatting up a girl I met in the club, talking shit to my mates. The first thing was when someone asked me to go through to the living room to calm down my ex-girlfriend because she was 'freaking out'. She'd taken the same as me at the same time. When I got to her she was terrified, she kept holding me really tight and crying. She said everything was finished and would never start again, then she started screaming, it was a blood-curdling, horror-movie, terror scream, I think even the djs stopped playing!I eventually calmed her down a bit and handed her over to one of the girls who owned the flat and told her to put her to bed and stay with her. When I went back to the living room I saw the faces of all the rest of the guys who had taken the LSD with me, they all looked either afraid or totally confused but always very focused. It was then I started feeling scared. The hollow feeling started, like I was loosing all self-esteem and self-worth. All optimism in me drained and I got a feeling of dread, not a worry of something impending but more like a worry of nothing impending.I looked at the rest in the room and they looked back at me, without a word there was a mutual understanding that we were all feeling the same. I tried to smile at someone as if to laugh everything off, he laughed for a second then started crying, he put his head on his hands. I looked at my best friend and he looked totally confused, we all looked at each other for answers. I don't remember time passing as such, but it must have been at least 1pm. By now I was feeling oddly lucid about what I was apparently beginning to percieve. It felt that in that short period of time the whole of mankind had, in unison, realised that there was nothing to live for. Everyone, myself included, saw that nothing was ever going to be achieved ever again, no love, no happiness, no discoveries, no new thoughts, nothing, this feeling right now was all there ever would be and it was called hell.Nothing else changed, I could see the sky outside the window, the faces of everyone in the room, the decor of the flat, nothing was different appart from the knowledge, shared by all, that life was over, man had failed whatever purpose or challenge given to him and now all that was left was eternal emptiness, right here in this place, right now and for ever. I/we were certain that this could not change. I couldn't feel anything appart from the empty dread and it terrified me, I couldn't feel my body. I grabbed a glass and crushed it with my hand cutting my fingers in the process, I thought that if I managed to feel pain it would prove that at least there was something else left in the universe, I felt nothing and the dread remained.I remember biting into the flesh of my index finger, I could taste the blood but not the pain. The panic increased, I realised that this was it, it would never finish. One of the others was picking up anything and studying it frantically, reading magazine pages, picking at the stitching on a jacket, feeling at the wood of the coffee table, he told me later he was trying to get a reaction out of himself to take his mind of the fear. What happened next I'm still trying to come to terms with. The feeling of dread and terror was crushing me, it was everywhere and I was 100% certain it was eternal, mankind had awoken in hell and there was no way out.I didn't feel anything when my fist broke through the window, I still don't know how the glass didn't cut my hand or my face for that matter. I almost had my whole body out when someone grabbed my belt. I'm quite a strong guy, I played rugby for years, they didn't stand a chance of holding me when I was kicking that hard, I had to end this. The last thing I remember was taking a deep breath of clean air and looking at the sky, then nothing. I was lucky. Lucky I missed the railings aroung the garden. Lucky I didn't land on my head. Lucky someone had called an ambulance when I crushed the glass in my hand, it was there almost before I landed. Lucky an orthopaedic surgeon was walking past the flat and came to help. Lucky I didn't die.Nobody's quite sure how I landed, they think it might have been on my arse, maybe my shoulders. They know I folded in half on impact, that's what did it. I fell about 35 feet, broke my back in 5 places, crushed two vertibrae to nothing and snapped my spinal cord in half. I can't feel or move anything below my rib cage, the official line is T8 complete paraplaegia. It took them 2 weeks to drain all the blood from chest cavity, then they operated to straighten me with two lengths of titanium. I've been in hospital for 3 months now, I'm hoping to be out for christmas but it depends how well the healing goes, the paralysis is totally permanent and I'll never walk again. I'm lucky I can use my arms and that I'll be totally independant eventually.I always said I would never touch acid, I only did because I was already hammered and it seemed like a good idea. I have nothing against taking drugs, my attitude towards it hasn't changed. I used to get called the nurse when we were out because I was always looking after everyone when we were fucked, I'd give pills to people who'd never tried them and then spend all night making sure they got through it enjoying it, even though I'd be hammered too. I'm not here to tell anyone to stop taking anything, I'm not here to preach, I fucking hate those types, just listen to my story. I was someone who could take all manner of shit and still knock back a drug I didn't want, I knew all the anti-drug stories; 'Johnny took acid then though he could fly, he through himself out the window, now he's dead.' They never wash with me because I knew that, ok, maybe I was a little out of control sometimes, but I wasn't going to go mental. I knew my drugs and knew where my limits were. No-one likes getting so mashed they can't remember anything the next day, we take it because it's a great feeling and we want to remember it.But just one time it reacted badly with my head. One time it was either stronger than I expected or I was already to hammered to take it, I've been in worse states and taken more drugs before. One time it all got too much and now I'm paying the price. Please be fucking careful, all the other trips can be great, but just one can convince you of things you thought weren't possible. I've always been a optimistic guy, I could not concieve of taking my own life, it'd be like breaking my prime directive, but I did try it.I'd love nothing more than to get out of this hospital, have a nice glass of wine, a big fat j, and maybe go to my mates and take some pills and listen to some tunes, but I can't. Not because I'm afraid. Because I can't bear to put my family and friends through the fear and pain again. I don't believe anything bad would ever happen to me again with drugs, but I can't risk tearing my loved ones' hearts out again, I'm afraid now I can only take a drink. I know you'll all have opinions on me and my experience and that's what I expect. Just please take this as a word of warning, not from a convert but from a pro-drug person, accidents can happen, lessen the risk and take care. Now, 'Nurse! Where's my damn morphine!'Exp Year: 2005ExpID: 48063Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 8, 2007Views: 14,705    LSD (2) : First Times (2), Bad Trips (6), Post Trip Problems (8), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Large Group (10+) (19) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:115 lbE drove up and picked me up as I sneaked out of my house and let my first dot melt into my tongue with no hesitation. We drove up to his place. I think it was about 10pm. We had a music on both in the living room and the bedroom. I don't remember how long of a time before I suddenly felt the living room was changing its size. I think it was the effect of the hallogen lamp. My attentions drew over to the dim light that the lamp was spreading out. Dark and back, dark to normal, dark to light. I don't exactly know how to describe this. It just seem like the room was alive and was breathing. I remember asking my friend if he sees the room breathing also. He said that I was just tripping and we laughed.I was just having so much fun. And then we went under the computer desk and started listening to the music. I don't remember what kind of trance it was, but it certainly wasn't a happy dreamy one because I started to feel like I was in this very dark place with no one beside me and was scared. I also felt very conscious of my self and thought to my self 'What the hell am I doing here?' I think it's then when I started getting a little worried about sneaking back on time. I was suppose to sneak back by 7am before my mom and step dad wakes up. I told E about how I felt and he suggest that we come out of there. We went in to his room and turn out the light, lied on the mattress and started listening to the music again. Orbital was playing. It was really pretty.When I closed my eyes, I saw this purple rail circulating in front of my eyes in 3-D, and it was still there when I opened my eyes in the dark again. It was really amazing and I was just having alot of fun. I asked E if he was seeing the same things that I was seeing, and he said no and explained to me the kind of things that he was seeing. He said that he was really fucked up and that we were really fucked up. He also said that he was very proud of me of how well I'm handling my self on acid. I think that brought back the worries and the negativity in this trip. I was giving an another thought to the situation. I started giving a doubt to my mind and thought about the possibilities of having a bad trip. And then I began to notice my self being very worried about getting home on time. By that time I already was picking up on my thought process and got caught up in the internal world instead of just loosing my self in the moments and the visuals and all. I took a look at E's face, and I stared at his face for along time. It started to shape up in to something very dark and monsterous. I got so scared and I ducked my head under my arms and had my face to the pillow. I took another look again at his face and he was smiling. He asked me what was wrong and I told him that he looked like a coyote and that he looked really really scary. I don't remember what he said but I started to feel really bad about what I said to him and thought to my self that I won't tell him anything like that again.I think I had to go to the restroom or something then. When I went in to the rest room and looked at my self in the mirror, I felt really normal. We sat in the living room and started to play some video games and smoked some cigaret. We were using a plastic cup for the ash trays and I accidently made a whole in the cup and ruined the carpet alittle bit. And then we started to talk. There were alot that we talked about that I will just skip off right now and go to a part where we talked about god. E didn't believe in god but I knew he believed in something. And then I remembered this phrase that E wrote on his computer before we got really high. It was something about fear. How conquring our fear will open a door to the secret. All of a sudden that phrase really started to make sence to me in a not very healthy way.I was thinking about things in a very scientific way, looking at reality in a very cold naked eyes. I was thinking about faith and for the first time I was a third person looking at my self with the faith and how I could have developed them. And then I burst into tears. I started to feel really depressed. It was really wierd because I wasn’t crying because I have realized the possibility that there might not be such thing as god but because of the fact that I felt like I have lost the magic about the matter and life as if I had already known the secret long time ago. I felt like I knew about the secret all along but had it hidden deep inside me either consciously or unconsciously.What ever I think about, and what ever I thought was true, felt like the truth at that moment. I was thinking extremely hard and about everything. E said that I was just peaking and that it was all drugs, but it didn't help at all. And then I began to notice the sun coming up. I went out side and I realize E was watching me from the window. I asked him why, and he said that he was worried that I might jump off the balcony. When I saw the sunlight I felt a little better because I felt the warmth and the power of nature. It felt like there had to be something out there. Something ultimately good. We tried to eat and then he took me back to my house.I was all by my self then. Now I was really hitting a cold reality. With no audience watching over me, and no one to complain anything about. I just had to figure out a way to get back to my house. Then I really started to get worried. It was already really late. I had to think about the way I was gonna get back in. Should I just wait a little and use the front door and act like I just went out for a walk or something. That is when I have noticed my self walking back and forth constantly about 5 times already on that block in front of my house. I got really scared and looked around the area to see if anyone was watching me. Because, even to my self, I looked really crazy. I was walking really fast, up and down that block within about 10 steps distance. I couldn't stop my self from walking and I was really annoyed by it. I had to force my self to calm my self down and literally had to talk to my self 'You have got to stop. You have got to stop'.I can't really recall how I got back home right now, but I got in very safely. I went back into my room and laid on my bed. It was so bright and I was seeing the patterns in the ceiling comming out at me in a constant motion. I closed my eyes to not look at those patterns and I was still seeing the reflects of what I have just seen. It was driving me nuts. I could not get to sleep. It was thee most annoying experience I have ever had. I also could not stop my self from thinking either. I was thinking about something and I tried to stop my self. But one thinking led to another thinking, and it was just killing me. I think I still extremely high, it has only been like 10 hrs. I wanted to rest but I couldn't. After that day, I felt suicidal for about 2 weeks. I even wrote a poem about why we should not live and why death should all make us happy. But I also wrote an another poem, about how we should either die or to live it our fullest. I think I had a very low tolerance for LSD, and might have given a big shock on my bio rythm or what ever. I remembered trying to focus on this colorful shapes that I see in the dark before I went to sleep when I was little. I understood where it was all coming from after getting high on acid. Now, I can see them when ever I choose to. But it isn't as easy as how I did them when I was a little girl. I loose my concentration really fast.I haven't done acid after that day for about 5 years now, and I'm thinking about doing it again after all that bad trip. Reality seems so boring these days and I feel like I have a lot more control over my thoughts, emotions and my world.Exp Year: 1997ExpID: 13346Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 16, 2007Views: 5,837    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Music Discussion (22), Depression (15), First Times (2), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:  oralLSDBODY WEIGHT:180 lbI  hope someone can identify with this or learn from this and in some small way I hope that I help myself by writing this. It has been 6 and ˝ years since I last used LSD. I think I used it over 40 times. But really, I have no idea. It may be as few as ten or twenty. The fact is, I just don’t really know.I have reached a point in my life where I can come to grips with my decisions as a younger man. I am still quite young, after all. I think I have almost come to grips with the fact that I may be nearly insane. And not a day goes by where I would not trade everything I’ve gained from LSD for everything I’ve lost. But I don’t really know. Simply because I no longer have anything to compare my reality with. It has taken me these six years to recover enough in my life to where I realize when I am having a psychotic thought. Finally, I am able to distinguish between reality and imagination. Most of the time.As a teenager, I experimented quite a bit. Until LSD. I won’t go into my first experience or second experience or third or whatever. Just my Last. And the day I saw the serpent and went to hell. The day that woke me up and changed my life, for better or worse.I dropped with numerous friends, numerous times. I had come to believe that my theories on life and my spiritual experiences were real. I never really saw anything visual. My trips were always internal. Internal thoughts spiraling into that great kaleidoscope that never ends. The eternal spiral that continues, deeper, and deeper, and deeper. I think I still kaleidoscope. It’s faint now. And only happens when I lie still in bed, awake before I fall asleep.Anyhow, it was a moderate summer evening in my hometown. Neither cool nor warm. The kind of unremarkable temperature that only strikes you as forgettable. I dropped with an older friend who I looked up to. He abandoned me for himself right before the onset and I walked home to my parents house in the suburbs. I watched some television, and it became boring so I turned it off. I searched my room for something to focus on. My lights were on. The moderate temperature and the well lit poorly decorated room was quiet. No wind, no sound. Nothing. And then, I began to think. I no longer recall what instigated the thoughts, but they spiraled, as do all trips into a continuum, this time into religious thought. And the spiral became a long tail. A scaly green tail. And then the mouth of the serpent swallowed me whole.I was totally struck. It was like snapping out of a dream and waking up to full and total awareness. And in my awareness, I realized that I had no purpose. None. And in that, I became aware that I was without God. I was aware and totally pointless. Life was so utterly devoid of meaning it is indescribable. I can only say that I have never felt so empty and alone in my entire life. And I became terrified. Absolute and total terror. I was in hell. Truly, actually, in hell. No burning. No devils. Just a total separation from purpose. I had lost all emotion, aside from utter terror. I couldn’t leave my room. My parents would know. I called someone who I thought was a friend. He cared only about himself, so I hung up.And cried. With no tears. A weeping, self loathing, pitiful cry without tears. I prayed for god to come back. I prayed for forgiveness. And, after I don’t know how long, I felt better. But this was only the beginning.I had stopped doing drugs entirely after a short time. I dabbled in pot still, but even that brought me to the spiral and back into some kind of terror. I began to believe that I knew others’ thoughts. I believed that other people knew mine. I restricted my thoughts. I didn’t want anyone to hear me. Then they felt my emotions. I couldn’t hide from anyone. Everyone could see me. Feel me. Hear me without me speaking. And this continued for years. I still feel it. Not as powerful, but I still catch myself thinking that others know my feelings and know my thoughts. I know it isn’t real. Thank you God, I know it isn’t real.The downside of my trip has taken nearly seven years. At one point I was convinced that God wanted me to write the next bible. I believed that I was a messiah. Not the messiah, but a messiah. At night, I would walk alone for hours talking to myself. I once walked twenty miles all day and into the night arguing with myself over whether Jesus was god or a man. Out loud. In public. The radio sang songs that were meant for me to hear and applied to my life in some way right then and there. In the winter, the bare trees were like foreign alien objects, forcing themselves out of the ground like unnatural self-aware alien life forms. They hated me. I would curl into a ball in public restrooms, convinced I was in hell again. I drew pictures of my pain. Naked bodies, hanging upside down by chains. Gagged and blindfolded. Self portraits of myself handing my brain to the viewer. Surrounded by white cloaked men representing the uncaring social world. Hands chained. My brain was constantly tormented. It never stopped. My dreams were nightmares. I felt like I was always on the verge of attaining what I wanted, but that I could never reach it. Like a never ending thirst. And this was for YEARS after not using ANYTHING. Now, I struggle to be normal. I look normal. I act normal. The only reason I can pull it off is because I can now distinguish hallucinations from reality. Most of the time. But not all the time.I know this is rambling. I’m sorry that I can’t give you an eloquently worded story of my experiences. My brain has become a patchwork of memories and emotions. I forget where I put things and what I have to get done for the day. Believe it or not, I live a pretty normal life. I’m middle class. Own a home. I’m married (no kids).But I still get that feeling that people can read my mind and feel my feelings. I don’t know where I would be without these years of terror and self hate. I don’t know who I am. I don’t know anything. But I do know one thing. I would kill. KILL. To be normal. To feel life the way it’s supposed to be. To feel reality again. To know what sanity is. To never doubt my mind again.Exp Year: 1997ExpID: 30710Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 18, 2007Views: 13,223    LSD (2) : Not Applicable (38), Health Problems (27), HPPD / Lasting Visuals (40), Post Trip Problems (8), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:4 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab) 3.5 goralMushrooms BODY WEIGHT:130 lbAt jazzfest this year I bought some acid and mushrooms the guy told us the acid was one hit wonders but we didnt believe him. O I took 4 hits and later an 1/8 of shrooms.  As the concert went on I was trippin out of my mind. I saw hundreds of planes in the sky and clouds were rushing past me. At the end of the concert we leave to be picked up by my mom and dad and I'm driving through the park as I realize that I'm in mario. So my parents drop us off at my car and I get in and drive off. I ran a red light with a cop right behind me and I failed the field sobriety test so he arrested me and brought me in after an hour of fuckin with me at the jail he let me go and brought me back to my girlfriends house. So then me and my girlfriend are chillin in her room and now I’m trippin wayyy to hard. I’m so far from reality at this point and it hasnt even reached the hardest of the trip. So then I start screamin things like nooo to black and tellin her to come back. Because of all the screamin her mom comes up and finds out. At this point I can barley move and I cant talk. So they call my parents and my parents come to get me. The carried me to the car. I black out. And wake up being wheeled into the hospital. All these nurses are askin me questions and I cant even think straight. I cant even process a single thought.  So they rip of my clothes put all the moniters on me start an iv. So then I think I’m dying and I rip the iv tube out of the iv bag because I just wanted it all to end. I pulled the white sheet over my head thinkin that it would make me die.  Then they give me charcoal so I thought it looked yummy and I chugged it.  Bad idea.  I puked it alll up haha. So then for 4 hours my thought circled in the same exact path always leading to the conclusion of insane. I was literally insane for hours. They then had to put in a catheter not cool at all I'm trippin then a guy shoves a tube in my dick wtf.

Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] It was my 18th birthday and I was extremely intent on making it one to remember! Thinking back it was silly idea. We went clubbing, where I took six tablets of ecstasy. Everything was going well until 4am when we left the club to go home. Whilst waiting for the taxi to arrive me, C and H took two hits of acid each. We had planned to do this and then go for a walk in the park/forest. At around 4:30am we rolled out of the taxi and started walking randomly around the dales. Sitting on a rock whilst my friends attempted to skin up out of the wind, I could see thousands of birds of varying sizes swarming all over the skyline in the distance. I thought it was quite funny, as it looked like the bit from the film “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas”. These creatures got closer and closer until it seemed that I could reach out and touch them as they flew past!Feeling a little unnerved at the apparent realness of the animals and the speed that they had appeared I managed to convince the other two that we should move somewhere else. Our new spot was sheltered and cosy but almost pitch black, which definitely played havoc on my mind! I was convinced there were people all around us, not moving just watching us, like something out of a Steven King novel! Although my friends had not taken as many pills they were starting to get very nervy and jumpy as well. We decided to make a run for the beach, surely that would calm us down.First problem, we had to get there! The walk to the road proved to be almost impossible. This particular forest we were in was quite remote and we rarely venture up there. To cut a long story short we got lost straight away. C was freaking out. I was keeping my terror to myself, which probably made things a lot worse for me, and H didn’t seem too phased. Whilst walking down a path it appeared that there was nothing either side of us, just scrub and small bushes as far as the eye could see, which admittedly was not far as it was still pitch black. Then I noticed, whilst turning round to mumble something to my fellow trippers, that the path we were following looked exactly the same in both directions. We weren’t getting anywhere and hadn’t been for some time!After what seemed like too long we arrived at a junction in the path. Now it looked exactly the same in all directions, a mirror image in every path! We had arrived at the centre. The centre of what I wasn’t too sure. Then a horrifying realisation began to creep over me. I had arrived at the place known as “West”. To you that probably means nothing, but if something is really odd or strange, especially whilst on drugs of some sort, then it known as west. And here I was standing in the place known as West. It was quite frankly west!!!!!This was too much for me to handle. I now believed that I was going through the stages of paranoia. First was ‘west’, then came ‘fear’ then came ‘terror’ which was surely to be followed by death or coma or some other horrible thing. Eventually we found our way to the road, which wasn’t much comfort. The long road that leads down to the beach is almost always deserted, especially at 5/6am, but low and behold there was a car right at the bottom driving very slowly towards us! That was enough; all three of us dived into a bush and cowered. Eventually the car rolled past, the road being about ˝ mile long! Back onto the road we came.From here onwards is where I really started to freak out! The road appeared to be covered in ball bearings and because of the slight hill in the road, the ball bearings were rolling down but leaving a pattern of balls that appeared to be stuck to the tarmac. I grabbed onto C for support who thought I was going mad jabbering about ball bearings and slipping over! Very soon we reached the beach. Its not a beach, its an estuary but we call it the beach. Once again the sensation that we weren’t getting anywhere took over. No matter how fast I walked the scenery did not change! Water on my right and a bank on my left.C and H decided to stop for a reefer, not something I wanted but I couldn’t persuade them to keep going. Whilst sitting on the bank looking out over the water a number of odd things happened. Taking a quick toke on the reefer little flies seemed to come off the end as it burnt down. Then, looking at myself I realised I was covered in millions of these little flies. And I couldn’t get them off me. Then, it being around 6/7am a jogger ran past us closely followed by a dog walker. C and H found this hilarious but for me it was too hard to mix the acid fuelled background and the reality of these two innocent bystanders. They looked real in every sense except that they looked like they had been super imposed onto my vision by some higher being who was controlling what I saw.I was convinced this higher being was ‘Acid’, not the acid I had taken but all acid all over the world, some God like demon who was there to torment me. I began to believe that C and H were not actually my friends but were all part of this so called Acids plan to teach me a lesson about taking drugs. Brought on by the fact they weren’t that fucked any more. I couldn’t take this, I was close to tears it was so scary. I had convinced myself that H could read my mind. In my head I asked him if he could read my mind. He looked at me and said yes, then started to chuckle. I thought that there was something I had to say or do that would make all this stop so I kept asking them what it was they wanted me to say. They thought I’d gone mad. Then, in a fit of insanity I grabbed the remaining pills we had and flung them into the sea. Spouting stuff about drugs being evil and that I was going to quit everything, even smoking! After half an hour or so of not saying anything I came to the conclusion that what I had to do was tell my mum exactly what had happened and what I’d taken and all this would stop. My friends laughed and told me to stop being stupid but how could I believe anything they said!Eventually we started to walk again, we were very close to my house by this point and I started to recognise the buildings along the waters edge. Although not from living in the area, but from some early childhood memory of the visions a man sees before he dies! I can’t explain it fully but I was now sure I was just going through the motions before I died. But not died, just never existed, I was being wiped from the history books in some way. Although I knew my parents would be there at the end to look at me sorrowfully and watch me disappear.By now the buses had started running and we walked towards the bus to go into the town centre, as going home now would have been a very bad mistake. As we drew closer it seemed to get darker and by the time I reached the door of the bus it was almost pitch black again. The only thing I could see were the driver’s eyes. He never spoke a word, just took my money and watched me slowly walk to the back of the bus. We were the only three people on the bus. C and H sat next to each other behind me and I knew they were discussing how I had performed on this little test that Acid had set me up for. In the centre of town, things started to calm down a little except one instance of seeing the ‘things you see before dying’ series of images again. This was further made worse by meeting someone from school in town and him saying to me “have a nice life %$Ł&*” Apparently because I refused to say a word to him. And another incident of going into a shop to buy fags, being unable to speak to the woman behind the counter and after a few minutes of horrible confusion just walking out again.Luckily when I did get back home I didn’t tell my mum, although there was an incredibly scary moment when my mum said as soon as I walked through the door, “Have you got something to tell me?” Shit I thought, she knows, she’s part of it! All she wanted to know was where had I spent the night. All I could manage to say was “The beach”. The fact that she was rippling and the walls were shifting didn’t help.A long sleep, or should I say a long time spent in bed followed by a long sleep calmed me down. Although for about a month after that event I was literally scared of going outside and had to think twice before taking anything anyone said as real.Conclusion: I'd never had a bad trip before this so was in, what I thought to be, a perfect state of mind. I had no worries and no anxiety before the events. I think I took too much over too long a period of time. But who can say what with drugs.You would have thought I had learnt from this experience but sadly no, I did it again, but involving no acid (because I never took it again after my  birthday!) but lots of ecstasy and a gram of cocaine. This happened 4 months later on new years eve. Since that episode I’ve taken tablets etc a couple of times, acid never, and stopped smoking hash! Lifes a lot less interesting, but at least I know I’m living in the real world now.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 18225Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Aug 23, 2007Views: 21,456    MDMA (3), LSD (2) : Combinations (3), Entities / Beings (37), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:002.5 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:450.5 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 1:151 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 8:00  smokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:140 lbIntroductionThis is a description of my first LSD experience, in 1988.  It was the second time I tried consuming tabs of LSD, but my first real experience with the chemical, as the first time, nothing happened. It would prove to be a major turning point in my life, a test that I felt that I barely emerged from alive and human.  I certainly hadn't ever been so close to total insanity before.BackgroundThe first time I tried LSD was when I was 17.  Either the paper was bunk or else it was an *extremely* low dosage; I ended up taking 8 hits without feeling anything. This is relevant in that it led to my liberal estimation, during my second attempt, of how much LSD was acceptable to take.Set and SettingWhen I was 18, I was in a depressing situation.  My girlfriend of one year moved to a different city for college, and I was missing her greatly.  It was the first time I'd lived away from home, and my apartment was a complete and utter pigsty.  I'm talking empty ice cream cartons left on the floor, along with slimy silverware, next to piles of shoes, dirty clothes, and some left-over lunch from three weeks ago in a bag.  I didn't worry about the mess, since I had nearly one hundred CDs to listen to, and music was my thing. I wasn't on any medications, although I was quite dependant on marijuana psychologically, smoking every day.  I was extremely excited about my first LSD trip, having just read Storming Heaven (evidently the information on the importance of set and setting didn't reach me). I took the LSD alone at night.The DrugI obtained four hits of LSD from some strangers at the park, who claimed that each tab was double-dipped. I assumed that they were just attempting to sell their product (as they say, never ask a barber if you need a haircut).  It wasn't until later that I learned that they had most likely been telling me the truth. The tabs cost 4 dollars each.The TripI started off by taking 2 and a half hits.  After 45 minutes, little seemed to be happening, so I took another half hit.  Another 30 minutes down the road (T+1'15''), I was only feeling slightly unusual, so I took the remaining hit.The trip started nicely, with the voices of Crosby, Stills, and Nash sounding like angels.  I smoked a bowl and felt the acid kick in more and more. Then I made the mistake of putting on Pink Floyd's first album - Piper at the Gates of Dawn.  It is extremely different from their later work, in that it is completely insane music, although it is depressing, just as their later stuff.  I started to get the idea that Pink Floyd had driven me mad.  My mind recorded a half-second interval of music, and started playing an approximately 4-second loop, with most of it 'empty', but that half-second filled-in each time. Every 5-10 minutes, it would record another half-second interval of music or noise, seemingly randomly, and soon it filled in the entire 4-second loop, which was playing in my head repeatedly.  From t+2 hours on, for the next 6-8 hours, time became meaningless, and so I don't have any sense of the chronology of the trip. I got the idea that my parents had driven up (an 8-hour drive) and were looking in through the peephole in my apartment door, and that they could see me. I felt an overwhelming feeling of disappointment that they had for me, since I had taken LSD.  I knew that they had stopped trusting me.  I then knew that if I opened the curtains, I would see, literally, all of the people in the world standing on bleachers that extended into infinity, and that all of them would be looking at me, disappointed in me. It made sense that I would be kicked out of my apartment, and would have to go live as a homeless person.I put on my bathrobe over my clothes, in order to look the part, and picked up a teddy bear, for comfort, and wandered around my apartment for the next 6-8 hours, without the ability to focus on any one thing for more than one second.  The repeating loop was still going, at full strength.  This 6-8 hour period seemed to take more than a week to me, although even that description is inadequate.  This was the worst hell I had ever experienced in my life.  I claimed afterwards that, if I had to endure the same torture for an entire week of real time, I would prefer to die.  The directness of the experience has faded with time, but I think that I might still be of the same opinion.During this time, my roommate, who was very anti-drug, called.  I answered the phone, for some reason, and he asked me for a friend's phone number.  I had to tell him that I'd call him back, since I couldn't even really figure out where the number might be, or what he meant, or how to talk on the phone.  I continued my wandering, and some time later, I happened to see that friend's number on a piece of paper.  I put it in my bathrobe pocket, thinking that it might come in handy.  Later, maybe a universe or two later, I saw a telephone in front of me, and picked it up and dialed some number. I do not know how I knew my roommate's girlfriend's phone number, but when my roommate answered, I simply read him the number in my pocket, and he never knew that I was located in another plane of existence, and that my tenuous grasp on his reality could have easily been lost if he had asked me any other question at all.It was music that destroyed me, and it was music that saved me.  In the midst of my wandering, I happened to pick up my guitar, and to play a few notes, each sound was like a raindrop falling and spattering, flowing musical beauty.  The sounds took me back home, somehow, and comforted me.  I began to relax, and realized that I wasn't about to become homeless after all.  I spent the rest of that night playing guitar, and enjoying the night air.  I smoked another bowl of marijuana and felt wonderful, although I still was very much shaken from the intensity of my bad hours. Eventually, I went to sleep, but the next day I was scared to leave my apartment, for fear of not knowing how to interact with strangers.  This fear slowly diminished over three or four days. I was not back to normal for months, in some respects.  Actually, this trip still influences me.Despite my horrible trip, the ending was amazing enough that I tried LSD again on many occasions, and enjoyed almost every minute of almost every trip.  After approximately 20 trips under my belt, I quit, and switched to natural alternatives such as mushrooms and mescaline.  My bad trip has affected my life ever since - that's more than 15 years.  It gave me strength, as I knew that since I had survived such a tremendous horror, I could survive almost anything. It also made me take less LSD after that - I never took more than 3 hits at once again, and I was more cautious in waiting for what I had already taken to kick in before taking more.  It was the bad music choice, as well as my bad emotional state and physical situation (set and setting!) that caused this bad trip.Exp Year: 1988ExpID: 43407Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Sep 2, 2007Views: 14,097    LSD (2) : First Times (2), Bad Trips (6), Music Discussion (22), Hangover / Days After (46), Difficult Experiences (5), Alone (16) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD  1 lineinsufflatedKetamine(powder / crystals)   smokedCannabis(plant material)   inhaledNitrous Oxide(gas)BODY WEIGHT:85 kgI had just got my hands on Ketamine for the first time. After a few Ketamine hazez I had decided that Ketamine was one of my favourite drugs, that is until the day I OD'd on Kay.Monday afternoon began with a good friend of mine coming over to do some acid. I took 2 hits and he took one around 11.30. Shortly after I brought out the Kay and thought to myself 'I wanna get really high' so I poured out a large dose, the largest I have done so far, onto my table to snort. I snorted 2/3 of it and stopped to take a rest. At this point my friend thought I had left a third for him so he took the rest of my dose, I didn't mind as I had taken a lot anyway.We had a really fun, relaxing trip for 6 hours. By this point we have smoked a few joints and done a few whippits of Nitrous. I had also eaten a lot of sugar and drank a lot of water. At around 6pm I was sitting in my sofa when I stood up to get something. As soon as I stood up my whole body went numb and I just dropped back onto the sofa. I couldn't move because I could barely stay conscious and this made breathing difficult as well. I shouted for my fried to 'Call the fucking ambulance, now!' because I knew something had gone horribly wrong. I was buzzing like never before, my whole body. My senses of my physical body were jumbled so I couldn't make out where my arms/legs were, I couldn't feel anything. At this point I was taking very deep and fast breaths in a panic. After around 5 minutes of this I started feeling normal again so I kept reassuring myself not to panic.At this point my mouth was very dry so I stood up and drank some water. As soon as the water went down my throat, my heart started beating extremely fast. My friend then told me that I shouldn't eat or drink anything from the other room (as he was on the phone speaking with a 999 operator). What bad timing, why couldn't he have told me that 1 minute before. I dropped back down on the sofa and looked down at my hands, to my horror all the muscles in my body had tightened, speaking was hard now as my mouth wouldn't allow me to talk properly. By this point I really started freaking out as I had lost all senses in my body, my muscles were all tightened, my heart was beating abnormally fast and my body was buzzing like mad.By around 6.30pm, I was convinced that my body would not be able to survive this 'shock' of excessive drugs, sugar and water. I get the horrible feeling that I am seconds away from death, what's even worse is the overwhealming buzzing of my body got worse and breathing became even more difficult. I knew my friend was qualified in first aid and CPR. I remember telling him something along the lines of 'You know CPR, just keep me alive'. I was begging god wishing not to die, not at the age of 19, not from a drug overdose. And here I am, my body buzzing more and more by the second, I am getting worse, I am going to die.Being on LSD at the time deffinately didn't help, it made all of these negative feelings extremely negative and when I would say to myself, 'I'm going to die' my heart would start beating really fast, a horrible feeling of adrenalin kicks in as I take deep breaths sitting absolutely still praying. The first people to reach my house were the police. Now instead of checking my vitals and trying to keep me alive they start asking my name, date of birth and all the useless shit you can't afford to waste your time on when you're minutes away from death. In a moment of anger I shout 'What the fuck is the point when I'm about to die!' They then ask me why I took all these drugs. Sitting there, helpless, completely crippled and caught off-guard I just stare at the police officer, there is a moment of silence where I am judged by all these people which makes me feel really bad.The ambulance arrives and the paramedics come. After telling them what has happened they tell me I need to walk into the ambulance. I manage to stand up with the help of 2 people. Completely disoriantated I step outside my house and into the back of the ambulance. My vision is so fucked I can't see anything beyond 2 meters. I also have double vision. The ambulance heads towards the hospital and by now I've realised that my senses are getting worse and the buzzing is getting heavier as breathing becomes even harder. I kept asking the paramedic, who was reading some charts, totally uninterested in caring for me, if I was going to die. Those people didn't reassure me at all and at the time when negative thoughts would send my heart into a spazm or something, that was all I wanted to hear. I tell the paramedic that I may wet myself as I didn't know if I could hold it in.We're now in the hospital and on a bed when the doctor gives me 2 pills to swallow and takes some blood. I urinate 600ml. That's nearly 2 full coke cans of urine! My brother arrives and I feel really bad, barely aware of my body let alone what's happening around me. He was very heart-broken and disapointed after he heard that I nearly died from a drug overdose. My brother doesn't do any drugs and that made the whole situation even more awkward. The buzzing throughout my body kept getting worse and now my double vision only enabled me to see about 1 meter in front of me but it was too much effort even keeping them open. In my disorientated state, I mumbled 'Oh, what a haze', everything felt like a dream. Blood results came back clean and I stayed in the hospital for a few hours, just basically waited the trip out.I've decided that, even though Ketamine is one of my favourite drugs, I won't be touching it anymore, because the margin for error is just too great. Also note: During the times where I had convinced myself I was about to die, all I could hear in the back of my head was the sweet melodic guitar riff from Intension, on Tool's 10,000 Days Album. That song now has a great meaning to me.Exp Year: 2006ExpID: 55386Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 7, 2007Views: 48,143    LSD (2), Ketamine (31) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Overdose (29), Health Problems (27), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:3.5 goralMushrooms(tea) 3 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab) 2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:175 lbI would like to start out by saying that I've tripped many times and made a hobby out of combining large doses of drugs, and this is by far the most unique situation I have put myself in.  3 friends and I were going to a 311 concert at a small university in Maryland.  We were from out of town so we got a hotel room a few miles away from the concert.  I noticed we had a stove, so I decided to boil my mushrooms and make some tea.  I started to feel the effects right before we left for the show (we left about 2 hours early), and it was nothing abnormal: dizziness, giggling, and the normal colors trails associated with psychedelic mushrooms.  My friends had decided to eat ecstasy instead of mushrooms since we also had LSD, so they popped their pills and on we went.  Right before we got in the car I ate 3 of my hits of acid.  I had 5 total, 2 different types, but this is the only one I had tried before.  After chewing on the paper for a few minutes I felt as if it was the right time to swallow it, which I did.  I promptly put the other 2 hits in my mouth and started chewing.  My friends asked me why I wasn’t pacing myself better, I told them I wanted to be peaking off the mushrooms right when the acid started to take its effect.  We went into the show and split up, one friend and I had general admission while the other 2 had pit seats.At this point I realized I had ate too many hallucinogens to be in a public place.  I started to feel paranoid, like something bad was going to happen.  An experienced tripper, I simply shrugged this off, telling myself I was just fucked up and keeping my psyche normal for a little longer.  Once we finally reached our seats and I sat down I began feeling very uncomfortable.  The warm-up band was loud and their music sucked and this began to displease me more and more by the minute.  I was hot, trippin balls, and I was ready to leave before the show even started.  Knowing that it would be completely ridiculous for me to even ask my friends to leave with me, I tried to suck it up.Then I got this thought in my head that I was going to die.  I was going to die unless I got water right away.  I told my friend who told me to calm down and he would help get me to a water fountain.  This is where it all went completely wrong.  I went to open a door and it was locked.  I became furious at this and started to run down the stairs, which I ended up falling down.  Once I fell down it became “clear” to me.  I had just died, the door being locked represented it being too late and the fall was me actually dying.  I began pleading with God to allow me one more chance at life.  Keep in mind I’m yelling this lying down on a stairway in the middle of a concert.My friend realizes he needs to get me the hell out of here and tries to get me up.  I start running.  Through people, into people, raising hell and catching the attention of one of Maryland’s finest police officers.  After watching me run amuck for a few seconds they approached me and grabbed me from behind.  Still thinking I’m dead, I thought they were God’s police coming to get me.  Not ready to die I began screaming and running away from them like there was no tomorrow.  I ended up running right into another group of officers and they all then struggled to get me out of the building.  I couldn’t comprehend what was happening and began trying to push my way free of them again.They ended up tackling me and eventually getting me into a cop car.  However, I was so fucked up I didn’t realize I was in a cop car, nor that I was handcuffed and that my face was pressed against the seat.  Being unable to move and seeing nothing but black, I realized that I was in hell.  I hadn’t exactly been a law-abiding, sin-free citizen.  I started yelling gibberish and getting very angry.  I was pleading with God to let me get into heaven.  Hell sucked.  Meanwhile in reality, the cops knew I was completely fucked up and as a precaution took me to the hospital.Carting me around a hospital only confirmed any previous doubt that I had that I was dead.  I was still yelling at God, begging and pleading for my life.  Well at this point they supposedly saw blood on my head (my memory is a little shaky so I’m going by the police report), and they decided that I needed a CAT scan.  I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a cat scan but you’re pretty much surrounded by white light.  I saw this as “seeing the light,” and figured out that God had finally decided to let me into heaven.  Already having accepted my death, I was pretty happy I wasn’t going to spend the rest of my life in that dark place I was before.Well after a few hours hooked up to an IV, I came to in the hospital, a nurse by my side.  I asked her if she was my guardian angel.  She gave me a puzzled look.  I asked again.  It was then that she said “Son, you’re not dead, you’re in a hospital.”  I didn’t believe it at first but after looking around I realized she was telling the truth.  After about 8 hours of thinking I was dead it became clear that I wasn’t.  I spent the rest of the weekend in the county detention center until my friends posted bail.  After that experience I realized that life was too precious to go out on a drug overdose and I am yet to trip since.Exp Year: 2005ExpID: 53691Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 15, 2007Views: 17,724    LSD (2), Mushrooms (39) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Mystical Experiences (9), Festival / Lg.

My girlfriend, best-friend, and I had all gone to New Orleans, LA for Voodoofest, an amazing 3 day concert event. One of our objectives was to find some good acid, as our town happens to be rather dry and high-priced when it comes to LSD. That first night, we bought 10 hits of 'eyeball' blotter from a random hippie. While my friend went off to see George Clinton, my girlfriend and I found someone with scissors and cut off 2 hits for each of us. Keep in mind that I can't be sure of times here, but I'm quite certain that I started to trip after only 15 minutes. My girlfriend, however, was much less phased even though she had tripped less times than me.After about 30 minutes I started getting scared. George Clinton's performance was too loud. The noises were becoming painful, and all I could see on stage was a huge ball of moving light. My girlfriends face also started to morph, and as I began to lose my own mind, I kept telling her 'Don't lose me' because she was obviously not enjoying the music either. Finally, our friend walked out of the crowd and found us. I told him he needed to walk us to the car because we both were starting to trip too hard for our own good. The path to the car was very crowded and dark. There were police lights flashing everywhere. The darkness started to take over. I couldn't see well for some reason. It became difficult to see my friends in front of me. I kept saying, 'Where are you guys?!', only to realize that they were right beside me.By the time we got close to the car, I was gone. I had forgotten where we were. My friend, who, luckily, stayed sober, kept reminding me that we were in New Orleans, and were supposed to be having fun. I was making outbursts in public. Basically all of the evil things my mind could conjure, I saw. I couldn't see what was really there at all. This fact was worsened when I realized I was stuck. I was in a town where I had no comfortable place to go. I couldn't escape that darkness.The duration of the trip is honestly a blur in my mind now. I was making outbursts, uncontrollably. I heard voices in my head telling me that I had lost my mind. I believed that I was insane, and that I wasn't coming back. However, for some reason I kept screaming, 'I'm lost, but this is all I ever wanted.' I thought that I had accomplished what I was put here to do, but that I was damned to be out of my mind for the duration of life. I kept begging my friends to talk to me, because everytime they did, it brought me back to reality a little bit. However, I always would quickly delve back into my mind. Soon, I thought I was dead. I saw pictures in my head of this 'Limbo' land. I had died and was basically retracing my entire life. I would yell my girlfriend's name over and over. Her name was the only comforting thing I could think of.I kept freaking out. I would bang my head on the windows of my car. I felt the seatbelt strapping me down, and I couldn't take it. However, I couldn't figure out how to get it off. I even accidentally grabbed my girlfriends hair once. I am not a violent man at all, but I honestly had no idea what I was doing. I don't even remember what I thought I was doing. My mind kept telling me I was on the brink of death. Sometimes, I felt as if I was rushing towards the evilness. I would yell, '(girlfriends name), please save me!' over and over, but it didn't work. I feel it necessary to mention here that my girlfriend was tripping very hard too. She, however, handled it. She admits to being extremely scared of me at some times, but she never lost her mind like I did.My mind was bouncing between sexuality, psychosis, and death. It was the worst trip of my life. The things I saw, I can't even begin to explain. Imagine putting your mind on a wheel, spinning it, finding some random place that you know so well, but being convinced that it is all gone. My friends told me that I would lay there, mumbling to myself for 30 minutes at a time, and then suddenly burst out screaming, often throwing myself violently around the car.I was in hell. I couldn't conceive life or death. I didn't care. As my friend was driving down the highway, I jumped up from the backseat and threw the car into park. This was extremely dangerous, and I don't know why I did it. Something compelled me. I noticed myself getting very sweaty. I tried to get sexual with myself, which I'm embarassed of considering that I was in front of 2 good friends. Honestly, I was just trying to do anything to escape all the pain in my mind. It didn't work.I tried to run out of the car, but my friend, who is much larger than me grabbed my arm. I screamed for him to let me go. I just wanted to run, but he wouldn't. I saw a scared look in his face. It turned evil. I saw him raise a knife and stab me. I started shaking, freaking out. All he did was grab my arm, there was no knife. Eventually, my friend was helpless. He didn't know what to do either. He stopped a random girl and told her what was happening. She sold him some random pain killers (I believe) and told him to make me eat them. When my friend gave them to me he said, 'Here, these will make you come down in 10 minutes, just eat them.' I happily chewed them up.The next thing I remember was waking up in the morning. Everyone was exhausted. We had had the scariest halloween ever. I was so scared of what I had possibly done that I took my girlfriend out and let her know how much I cared. I told her I was so sorry, that it was only the drugs, I honestly couldn't help my state. She was amazing and understood. She stuck with me through my own insanity.I hated this trip, but I wouldn't take it away for anything. I think I learned from it. I'm a very experienced drug/psychedelic user, and this completely deflated my ego. I realized that sanity is not a given. It can so easily be ripped away. The next day, I took 1 hit of the same acid, tripped, and felt fine.  It was during the day, so there was no darkness to take over. This experience was profound, I still turn it over in my head every day. I've never been the same.Exp Year: 2003ExpID: 29153Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 1, 2007Views: 7,225    LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Guides / Sitters (39), Relationships (44), Bad Trips (6), Festival / Lg.

Told him to give me two tabs, one for me and a friend (Kenny). I knew my Kenny would be in the local hangout spot in the woods and when I got there I saw him sitting on the steps to some poorly built clubhouse/5X5wooden box-in-a-tree. I said 'Yo! I got some fucking acid!' We giggled like two school girls in excitement, really hyped because we had been best friends for a long time and always wanted to do 'hard-core LSD' with each other, but something always came up. So we popped the paper tabs at around 3-4 and sat on the steps, they were steps to a deck we ripped off from a construction site, bullshitting over some cigarettes.Maybe 15-20 minutes later we see a fly land on a log and started staring at it. After we realized we were both staring at it for about 5 minutes, we just looked at each other and went 'heh,' then we started laughing some more. Anyway, we just laughed because we both knew that we were burnouts (16 at the time). So we left the woods and a went a few blocks away to a friends house. Told him we were on acid and watched some TV. His Mom came home and he told us to get the fuck out and wait for him and his brother on the corner. Later he and his brother met us and they bitched because we didn't get them any acid. So we walked to the acid guy's house and he wasn't home. So after hearing them bitch they decide to go get some of the 'good weed' from some dude. This guy is rarely home so we usually don't even bother, but we did and he was home (lucky us). One of the brothers (Anthony) buys a dime and we set off to what would be the night that almost killed me, left me permanently insane, a hippie christian or dead.We go back to the woods and find another one of our friends (Lou) sitting on a rock waiting to see if anyone was gonna come around. We greet him and bullshit for a little bit, then me and my friend start to 'feel weird.' Anthony is telling us about a few nights ago when he was hanging out at a beach and the cops raided it. Now this fucking kid can tell a story. He's going into to detail about every move everyone made and exactly how it happened. While he's telling the story, I feel the damn acid starting to work, and I knew Kenny did too. Things start looking a bit distorted and the the crickets I hear are starting to bug me out bad. Anthony starts talking about him running from the cops and it being hard to run in the sand and jumping off fucking little cliffs and trying not to fall over the peer and die.Now I start thinking to myself (while all I hear is Anthony babbling in some strange laguage and the crickets sounding like some sort of spiraling noise) 'What if the cops come!? I'm fucked! Oh my God! If they come, I can't talk, I'm out of this fucking world! I've lost touch with reality, holy shit! The cops are coming? The cops ARE coming!' So I just walk away verbally saying 'The cops are coming' over and over like a chant. The cops are coming, the cops are coming, the cops are coming. I walk down some path, and then walk around in a circle for about ten minutes just saying 'The cops are coming.' Then my friend Kenny comes by and starts asking if they're really coming. I get out of the trance and go 'What?' We stood there silent for about 10 minutes, trying to take in this incredible surrounding which just seemed to be a blur. So many leaves and trees and dirt, and the sounds of the forest only making things much worse.We go back to the clubhouse steps and Kenny says 'I see them. Looking through that window. Godamn pigs.' For some reason I saw them to and some window. But we didn't seem worried anymore. We lit a cigarette which tasted like warm milk (Marlboro light). We go back to Anthony and Lou who rolled the good weed joint and a blunt. Kenny sits on a rock and starts meditating, going ohmmmmm. Ant and Lou are laughing at him and for some reason I started to get freaked out. I tried to keep cool, I sat on a rock and felt my heart beating and heard myself breathing. Then I had the 'outter body experience'. I see myself sitting on the rock. I get up and start moving like a worm, because I can see myself do it but not actually comprehend that I'm making myself move. Amazing! Lou and Ant are dying. One kid on a rock meditating with his legs crossed and me standing up and squirming like I had no bones.They spark up, and ask if we want a hit. I thought maybe it'd bring me down, that's what I heard. I took two fucking hits, I don't think I even inhaled. And that's when it began. The crickets! The sounds made things so much worse. It sounded so distorted and all around me. I started seeing little dots and I say to Kenny 'Do you see that!?' and he says yes. We feel scared and fucking boat out of there. We get out of the woods and the change of scenery scares us even more. We can't see things normally, we still hear the distorted cricket sound and we feel like we're stuck in a dream. Exactly like a dream. Terrified! Our spines were tingling and we had goosebumps. We were just scared. Then, we ran. We ran about two blocks. Then we saw our friend's house, which gave us a bit of a sense of reality back. But we were still freaked, it felt like a bad dream, like something scary was constantly behind our backs. We somehow ended back at the woods.The dots came back, this time they were red little dots, like the beam from those guns. I asked Kenny if he saw them and he said he did 'the red ones!?' he saw them the same way I did, don't know how or why. I said 'Dude, it's the government. They can always see us.' Then we started bullshitting about how they have satelites that can read the print of a newspaper and shit like that and fake animals that are robots. We can barely understand each other slurring our speach.Ant and Lou find us and try to calm us down. We grow suspicious of them. I was going to pick up a rock and bash in Lou's skull and I knew Keny was thinking the same. Ant goes, you guys need a drink, your lips are dry, I can see the chapped skin on them LOL. He goes across the street from the woods to the deli and grabs us a fucking CITRA! this was like the citrus drink at the time. He says don't worry, the cops aren't coming and neither are the FBI. Look at the printing on the back of the bottle, it'll get your mind off it. Now me and Kenny are thinking, what the fuck is he up to? He's trying to trick us! We started yelling at him violently. I don't know what we were saying.We sat down and then fucking drank the stuff (LOL). Made me feel a lot better. It got dark out so we found our big ass lattern light and sat around all of us fucked up. Then a Rabbit comes along, me and Kenny were thinking about killing Ant and Lou. Just staring at them evily like we knew they were with the area51 type of guys. The rabbit walks right in the middle by our light and just sits there. I didn't think I was seeing it, but was somehow just drawn to it. I hear the fucking thing say 'Mike, it's God. I'll stop this, but promise me you'll never do it again.' Sits for a few more seconds the hops back in the weeds. I hear the weeds shake and heard them perfectly. I was brought back to reality!I went home that night and ate about 4 bottles of pringles and a creamcheese sandwhich, I think I used like half the jar of creamcheese. The trip wasn't over. Me and Kenny were still talking about the governemnt and still felt like they were watching us. Then we got into that Y2K and the government making 'the beast chip' bullshit. About 6 months later we realized that we were still bugging out from that acid. It fucked us up big time. Everyday it was just me and Kenny talking about the government and the end of the world. Until we realised we had just been owned by acid.Exp Year: 1999ExpID: 31303Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 14, 2007Views: 6,680    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Mystical Experiences (9), Hangover / Days After (46), Post Trip Problems (8), Relationships (44), Difficult Experiences (5), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:105 lbAbout 2 weeks ago my friends and I drove to Dallas to get some acid. We had finally found a for sure connection. I had done acid before when I was 16 and another time when I was 17 and I had tripped shrooms a ridiculous amount of times. I was pretty excited and at the same time a little nervous b/c a few weeks before I had actually had a bad trip on shrooms, which was suppose to be impossible.We bought a sheet, and the image was so crazy its impossible to describe. We drove back to Oklahoma in anticipation just staring at the sheet. All of us were so excited. Some of us had done before but many of the people we were bringing it back for had never done it before. I had been feeling a little skiddish about doing acid b/c at the current moment I was having alot of problems such as financial, relationship and just overall depression but I figured if it didn't effect me too much on shrooms maybe it wouldn't with acid. Oh my God I so wrong!At first everything was awesome, the visuals were so intense and we were all having so much fun. Then when a few of us were laying around in a room watching finding nemo I got a bad feeling, something about the movie just made my head go in a completely other direction. The room got really dark and I felt like I was alone in the room. The visuals started to get really scary. I started to get really depressed and wonder why I was even here or what was the point to even living anymore. I seriously couldn't see how I was going to fix my life at all. I somehow managed to get ahold of my cell phone and I called my mother. Yeah I called my mom while tripping acid. I started to tell her I didn't see how I was going to fix anything and how I didn't want to live anymore. I was on the phone with her for an hour just crying and telling her how much I wanted it all to end and how all I wanted to do was go to sleep. I also kept asking her to bring me some sleeping pills b/c I wanted to just go to sleep and not wake up. I was sitting there with a raxor blade trying to cut myself but for some reason it either would run away from me or my wrist wouldn't stop moving.Eventually someone noticed me and realized I was upset and when they realized I was talking to my mother they grabbed the razor and the phone from me and hung up. It just got worse. The room wouldn't stop spinning. I couldn't see straight and I felt like I couldn't move. There were about 4 people there who were not tripping (the babysitters) and they all carried me into another room and laid me on the bed. I don't remember much from that point except that it was dark and occasionally the room would stop spinning for a few moments for me to be able to focus on the scary devil man that kept chasing me. My friends all tell me I wouldn't stop screaming and they were so thankful no one else really noticed b/c of the loud music or that would have caused a panic among others. We were also at a cabin in the woods so no one was around to complain to the cops or anything.Finally at one point all the screaming and thrashing around had worn me out and I passed out. I woke up the next day with my sober friends all kind of holding me passed out. I walked into the bathroom still seeing chasers. I looked in the mirror and my face, arms, my entire body had scratches and bruises on it. My wrists were all scratched up my forearm had a huge gash on it from where I had actually managed to get the razor to hit. I felt like shit, my head hurt and I was overall just pissed off.I had freaked my mother out hardcore as well. And she demanded from one of my friends to tell her what was wrong with me and they told her I would have to tell her. So I had to tell my mom I had done acid and just had a bit of a nervous breakdown while on it and I was sorry and what not I scared her. The only thing for a week after that I could remember from the whole thing was that I called my mom and I was screaming alot. I had managed to block out the bad trip from my head but then finally later on I started to remember alot of it. I also started to have alot of nightmares related to that night.I'm still having nightmares where I see the little devil man chasing me and where the rooms starts spinning.That experience didn't ruin acid for me though. I will do it again just not for awhile, not until I am in a good state of mind which will probably be in a couple of years or so. Anysways thats my bad trip on acid story.Exp Year: 2004ExpID: 32816Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 17, 2007Views: 5,616    LSD (2) : Guides / Sitters (39), Bad Trips (6), Large Group (10+) (19) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(pill / tablet)BODY WEIGHT:125 lbI had about 20 experiences with LSD before, usually 1-2 hits maximum per trip.  The settings were mostly spiritual, our intention were well defined, and almost always answered at the end of the journeys. During my trips I was at the big-bang,  saw little robot-like creatures putting the atoms together to create the universe, I was the fish in the ocean, the bug on the floor. I saw the sound moving, talked to birds, felt the pain of a wounded soldier in Iraq, saw the spirit leaving her body at a funeral, discovered where and who I was before my present life, etc. During these trips I was never terrified, even though some of the dreams, thoughts were not pleasant. My latest trip was very unusual though and I would define it as an extremely interesting, but “bad” trip.  I had a headache for two days before the trip and taking pills for it caused some stomach problems that dehydrated me.  Also,  I was overworked and under-rested.  On a beautiful full moon day my friend and I both took one hit.  We came on in 20-30 minutes, made love with many orgasms.  Just experiencing my partner’s orgasm triggered one in me.  After that I went to the bathroom, and suddenly I got very dizzy.  The whole world felt suddenly twisted, and I felt like I stepped over the imaginary, the “other” world.  Once back from the bathroom, I was not able to speak coherently.  I was shaking and my stomach started to hurt.  I checked the clock, and it showed 3:10 PM.  My friend saw that something was not right, and tried to talk to me, but I was not able to respond.  In my mind I was trapped in the “other”, the imaginary world.  I saw the parallel universe, which was behind the imaginary world.  I saw myself in both places.  I checked the time again, and it was still 3:10 PM, even though I traveled everywhere.I suddenly felt the urge to have some professional help.  I thought maybe if I go to the emergency room they can stop my “bad” trip. And I looked at the clock again, and it still showed 3:10 PM.  I really got scared.  I thought I was trapped in time, and in a world, that is non-existent in the “normal” perception of things.  I thought no one can help me, since time does not exist. I will live my life in 3:10 PM from that point and there is no solution to that problem.  I saw my life like a movie running in front of my eyes, I felt sorry for myself, and I through up.  All my pain, my stress, my sadness came out from my mouth.  People, situations, thoughts, that hurt me, like broken glass fell out from me.  I felt purged, relieved but still way over the other world.My body was shaking, my legs could not hold me.  I was afraid to let myself go.  I thought if I do, I will never come back.  At that time my friend decided to get some niacin to stop my trip.  While he was gone, I took cold and hot showers, hoping it switches me back to reality.  Nothing.  I set down to do some yoga.  No result.  I tried to meditate, to cry, I could not.  By that time, I thought I got schizophrenic, induced by LSD, and from now on I will see the world that way.  I truly believed I lost my mind for good. It was very scary. My friend got back by 4 PM and I started to take the niacin.  Gradually, but very slowly I was getting better, however, my short term memory seemed effected.  I could not remember the morning’s events, the previous days event, not even our wonderful love-making. About 8-9 PM I started to recollect my memory, but my speech was still not perfectly coherent.  I watched the Olympics, but could not put the situations and people together.  Next morning I was still a bit on a slow side, but by afternoon I was back.Looking back, it was a very shamanic but scary experience.Exp Year: 2004ExpID: 36447Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 6, 2008Views: 9,695    LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Sex Discussion (14), Hangover / Days After (46), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:002 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 2:001 repeatedsmokedCannabis   T+ 2:0010 mgoral2C-E(powder / crystals)BODY WEIGHT:135 lbUntil this trip I had been relativly comfortable with Lsd, having used it a dozen times or so, and I had once tried 15mg 2c-i and although that was a frantic mindmelting adventure, I maintained a safe mind set and managed to enjoy myself. A long time friend of mine and I took 2 hits of paper acid at around 4pm, on a warm sunny friday, we were in a very good spirts and expected a good trip. The first 2 hours were rather light, just buzz not to much visuals, but very enjoyable. Around that time we met up with a friend of his and used his cannabis vaporizer, He wanted to trip with us but since we had eaten all the acid I had, the idea came up of splitting 2 2ce 15mg capsules 3 ways. I didn't have a accurate enough scale so I opened them and split the bright white crystals into 3 piles as equal as I could make them, poured each onto a small piece of toilet paper and wrapped it into a ball. We swallowed them and went back outside. I didn't mentaly prepare my self for the 2c-e at all. I didn't even really think through that I just took a powerful pscycidelic which I had never done, on top of an acid trip which isn't even in full gear, and that I was about to tripping out really hard and should make accomidations. Within 5 or 10 miniutes all three of us felt the effects. About an hour later, I made a classic tripping mistake, going back to my room alone. Its started to get a little windy and chilly so I went back to my room to change. The cold started to raise abstract doubts, and bring down the positive energy. After taking a shower for about 2 hours, I called my friend who had also done the acid and 2c-e, and asked him to come to my place. When he got there we started having a very emotional albiet nonsencical discussion/argument. At the end of which I was crying and screeming and I told him to leave. It was the last time we've spoke. The hullicination I was having a distortion of the image I have of my self. I hated this person, who I just realized I really was. I felt I didn't deserve to live. Complicating the issue was the full bottle oxazapam (like valium), in my desk, making suicide a readily available option. It was torture, my life was in my hands, and 100% of my consciousness was telling me to let it slip into the abyss. I think the main thing that kept me from doing it was the thought, that I'd be the only one who wouldn't have to deal with my death. I called one of my better nontriping friend who knew  me well, and is an artist at defusing crisises drug related and otherwise. I stayed up all night, the visuals, didnt subside till around 6am. As bad as my trip was my friend who took the same shit I did had it much worse. Although I havn't talked to him personally, I hear that he had a mental breakdown of some type. What I do know is that he was acting eractict enough on saterday that some authority saw him called the police and had him commited to mental institution for a few days, and had him kicked out of school. From what I hear he returned mentaly back to normal around 3 or 4 days after the trip.     Was this a result or circumstance, prexisiting stress, or an inherent result of taking 2c-e and lsd together. I think a bit of all three but, I don't think they are few many people who could handle a trip so intensly stimulating and relentless visually hallucinagenic.Exp Year: 2005ExpID: 47415Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 18, 2008Views: 22,691    LSD (2), 2C-E (137) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:4 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab) 1 repeatedsmokedCannabis June 3, 2007As I write this I feel somewhat disillusioned as to what the core nature of reality and existence really is. Will it ever truly be explained? Should it be explained? Life, god, purpose, all these things come to mind when thinking of my experience this drug, and my condition forever afterward. I first took this drug at a party at my house at the beginning of 2007. I was bored and there was nothing to do, so when somebody asked “hey you wanna try some LSD?” naturally I said “yes, yes of course I do.” I had never tried acid before in my life and didn’t know what was in store for me on this night of all nights. The night the universe tore itself apart, and reality ceased to be.All I had to go on was what I had heard from friends and what I had seen in movies. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, is a good example. I bought four hits for seven bucks each and took them all at once. The first few minutes I remember looking up at my digital clock display and wondering how long until it would kick in. Every minute brought along a fierce and sudden increase in the intensity of the drug. There were a lot of people around and things were happening that I wasn’t sure of. At first it seemed the world had turned into a scene from The Nightmare Before Christmas. Then someone came to the party with a bottle of vodka, I wasn’t in the state of mind to refuse alcohol so I ended up drinking half the bottle without hesitation. As the booze went into effect I lost coherency and a grip on reality. I think I blacked out the whole night. I was told the next day that I was running around the house without my shirt on, yelling colors and names at people and babbling incoherently and occasionally falling asleep. At one point I remember being given a cooked chicken strip and throwing it on the ground because I thought it was turning into part of my hand. I also remember sitting on my couch and looking off into the distance and hearing helicopters and police sirens and seeing evening horizon colors: it was much like a glitch that happens in the Grand Theft Auto videogame series in which the player falls through part of the ground and is floating in an alternate world made of only sky and horizon, yet you can still hear the cops and helicopters chasing you around. The last thing I remember was tearing my shirt off and being scared because my body shape had changed and the hair on my chest was gone.Early the next morning I remember not waking, but coming down enough to realize what was happening. I was screaming for my brother to save me. Then I was thrashing around in my bed trying to puke and basically going out of my mind. I saw an alternate reality in which I was an old sick pervert who preyed on young girls; everything was dark except for blue flashes of lightning, much like a scene from a David Lynch movie. Then I remembered something my friend told me: just breathe, relax, breathe deep and slowly. So that’s what I did and it worked. Then the trip was more easy to handle. I saw palm trees all around me and could hear the beating of drums I could hear the sounds of a beach shore line. I then saw a blue glowing apparition of the god Shiva smiling down on me. Then I felt like I was climbing out of a cave made of pillows and blankets. I opened my eyes and saw my glowing alarm clock and it turned into many clocks, melting like a Salvador Dhali painting. I slowly came down little by little. By the time the sun started to rise I thought I was dead or in a coma, I thought the ambulance noises I heard were real and that maybe I was at the hospital in a bed with my family waiting for me to wake up. I walked around the house wondering if what I was seeing was a construct of my imagination. I sat down on a couch next to a sleeping friend and watched his body morph into a skeleton. I looked up at the time to see if it was constant. It was, except it seemed to be running faster than usual. It felt as if I was god and [not that I wanted to be] the universe was repairing itself for me. I felt like if I was in an elaborate program designed to simulate life, and I had broken or caused a glitch in the program by taking the acid. The next day everything was near normalcy again except that the colors seemed more vibrant and television programs had little differences caused by hallucinations.Ok now fast forward about three months. After a long time of being restless and generally bored again I felt like a little medicine was in store for me. It was in the cards, so to speak. I started on a Friday by going to a friend’s house and drinking a bunch of tequila and smoking a bunch of pot, nothing special. The next day I received a good amount of marijuana and smoked it all day and most of the night. I had some spliffs, some kief, and a buttload of doobies. A lot of smoke, but still nothing wrong until… the next day, Sunday now. The night before I started feeling funny and had to go to sleep. I woke up feeling really out of it, almost like I had been doing acid. I didn’t think much of it and decided to smoke some more weed. I actually thought the weed would help, maybe to numb out the fear and paranoia of a bad episode. After the first few hits a felt worse than ever, I tried to sleep it off. Things became progressively more and more intense.Whenever I would close my eyes I could see millions of little lights floating around at high speed. They were Red, Yellow, and Blue in color. I guess since those are the very basic colors, they seemed very important at the time. I saw the face of God represented by the millions of colorful lights. Next things got freaky, I started seeing dead relatives and historical figures back from the afterlife coming in through my walls trying to communicate with me. Every few minutes I would endure some new type of horrific torture. I have been shot, stabbed, electrocuted, suffocated, crushed, frozen, burned, hung by a noose, stoned by rocks, and drowned. I have spoken to Shiva, Rasputin, Jesus Christ, Adolf Hitler, Bob Marley, Che Guevara, Ghandi, Hunter S. Thompson and Leonardo DaVinci among others.At one point I thought I was Benjamin Franklin and that the electrical socket was the source of lightning and that I would be struck by lightning. I saw myself on my death bed, I saw myself being born, I saw all of my past lives and my future lives. I felt as though I had died, or as if in some past life I had let a son or daughter of mine die. I cried so hard and screamed in agony for the loss of life. Then I would scream in anger at myself. Sometimes I would laugh maniacally for the righteous truths which I had been revealed. Toward the end I was gripping on to songs and television programs and movies which agreed with what I was going through to help understand what was happening. I saw the resurrection of the Messiah, I saw the end of time itself.My younger brother had to look after me to make sure I didn’t hurt myself or anyone else. Several times I would see cuts forming on my fingers and blood spilling out and I could feel the pain so clearly that I thought it was real, I felt like it wouldn’t make a difference if I actually did slit my wrists or electrocuted myself just to end the pain and the insanity. Eventually my parents returned home from their trip, they had gone on another weekend trip, and when they arrived and saw me in this state they were shocked and alarmed. The ambulance was called and I ended up in the emergency room at the hospital.After talking to some doctors and my own personal assessment I am pretty confident that the marijuana triggered the psychosis, or “flashback.” I am a psychiatric patient, and had been told many times before to beware of marijuana. Never in my life had I experienced a bad trip from marijuana, but with the added bonus of LSD everything changed. I can no longer use any drug whatsoever, I can’t use money, and I am constantly being watched to make sure it doesn’t happen again. My life may never be the same. What was once an exquisite escape by means of marijuana has turned into a dangerous maneuver thanks to LSD. I don’t recommend it to anyone especially those with psychological problems. I wish I could take it back and not be fucked up, but I can’t.Exp Year: 2007ExpID: 63456Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 7, 2008Views: 44,940    LSD (2), Cannabis (1) : Bad Trips (6), Entities / Beings (37), Post Trip Problems (8), Combinations (3), Alone (16) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD  3.5 goralMushrooms(dried) 2.5 gsmokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:185 lb   It was a Friday night last week, a little get together with 4 people to have a good time. I'm 17 and have done marijuana since I was 12 numerous times, have done acid 3 times and mushrooms only once. We had done 2 dollar a hit acid, and taken 2-3 hits of that. This night we got very good acid, 5 dollars a hit, 275 ugs per hit. I talked to my friend Z and asked him to get us not only that but 1/2 an ounce of mushrooms for us 4, 1/8 apiece. I had 1/8 of kind bud and we planned on having a crazy weekend. We intended on taking the acid Friday night, then the mushrooms early Saturday morning then going to a party Saturday night, it didn't quite work out that way.    We took 1 hit of the acid and then smoked 4 bowls in Zs new glass piece at 8 oclock. A half hour after the first hit we took the other hit of acid and smoked 2 more bowls, to make sure we were chill and didnt do anything too crazy. An hour and a half after the first hit of acid, we were really stoned and it hadn't kicked in yet, Z said it might not have been real acid so we decided to take the 1/8 of shrooms. Big Mistake.   We ate the shrooms and saved the crumbs for the next day to lace with weed. We decided we had best smoke some more weed because the acid could have a little effect, so R rolled us a pretty big joint, about a gram in it. So we were incredibly chilled, and about 30 minutes later it kicked in. I expected the shroom effect I had before, but it was unlike the shrooms or the acid I had taken in the past. The colors reminded me of mushrooms, but the crazy thoughts in my head and the shaky environment told me right then and there that the acid was indeed coming into effect. It had been 2 hours since the first hit of acid.   I looked over at R and he wasn't doing too hot, he was curled up in a ball on my bed staring at the floor. He kept muttering something like, 'I can't fall. I just can't fall'. It's gonna get me. So we decided to smoke some more of the weed seeing as to how he was having a bad trip. That idea was even worse. I looked at the bowl and it was looking kind of funky, I couldn't get the flame in the bowl to spark the weed. I decided to just give up and let R smoke the whole thing, Z and A agreed with me. He picked up the bowl and threw it against the wall, and yelled out, 'Oh my god, what the fuck is wrong with you guys! Are you trying to kill me!' Luckily the bowl didnt break.   It had been about 3 hours since the first hit of acid, and the shrooms and both hits of acid were in effect. I kept seeing people walking in and out of my room, I told one of them to get the fuck out and he turned around and his face was that of a demon. It was one of the scariest things I had ever seen in my life. He looked at me and said, if you want your family to stay alive you will shut the fuck up and go to bed, so I tried by damndest. I was on the floor face down, with my eyes closed. With shrooms I had seen smilie faces and such, and with acid I had seen colors, but oh, not this time. All I could think of was what he said, and there were flames and screams. I couldnt get it out. Obviously the weed had not done much, even though we smoked most of the 1/8. I can only imagine what it must have been like if I didn't smoke the weed.   It was about 4 and a half hours since the first dose, we had taken 550 ugs of acid, 1/8 (3.5 grams) of mushrooms, and 2.5-3 grams of weed. I was still on the floor scared shitless. I looked at R and he wasn't doing to hot at all. Z had done acid some 2 dozen times, shrooms about 15, he seemed to be handling it quite well, so he was talking to R and trying to calm him down. He was enjoying his trip, and decided it would be good to give R a bowl of his weed, he didn't say what it was, but it was stronger then KB. He held the bowl and sparked it for him, but he didnt want to smoke it.    At this point it got really foggy. It was 5 hours into it, and I remember stuff at about 7 and a half. I start remembering stuff at me being in my car, scared shitless of the demon faced people inside that want to kill my family, and on top of that (I'm not sure what happened in that 2 and a half hours) I thought that everyone turned into werewolves and wanted to kill me. Z had managed to get R in bed and chilling, A was in my room with him. A was sketchy, but not as bad as me or R, Z was actually enjoying it. He went out on the roof and was staring at the sky talking about how beautiful it was.     At about 9 hours, I stopped tripping badly. I had vomit on my shirt and had peed my pants (at least that's what it smelled of). I went inside my house, still tripping pretty hard, and found R asleep and A and Z on the roof. I went up on the roof and they looked at me kind of funny, I told them that I wasn't having a bad trip, they were talking to each other and chilling and I joined in. We stared up at the stars and chilled. At about 11 hours the sun was coming up (7 in the morning) and we were still tripping. We went inside and put on The best of the Grateful Dead and laid back. R woke up and was tripping, but he was better (as in he was not having a bad trip) We talked and chilled, staring at my posters of the beatles and method man, and they would come out of the posters and sit next to me and start talking to me. Method Man has a blunt in his mouth in my poster, and we were passing it around.    At 18 hours it was 2 in the afternoon and we started to come down. We all took a nap on my floor, woke up at about 6-7 and didn't go to the party, we were coming down from everything still. We had about 4 bowls of weed laced with shrooms crumbs. We each did a bowl apiece and weren't tripping very hard, but were so happy and stoned. We put on soul plane, then half baked, then idle hands and could not stop laughing. We were crying rivers and it was great. At about 32 hours (4 in the morning) we were coming down from the weed and shroom crumbs, and went to bed.    The first 9 hours of my trip was incredibly horrible, I never want that to happen again. I loved it later on, I will probably do it again but with only 1 hit of acid. I strongly advise anyone intending on doing shrooms and acid to think it over twice, It's rough if you're not up to par.Exp Year: 2004ExpID: 39029Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Mar 28, 2008Views: 21,689    LSD (2), Mushrooms (39) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Guides / Sitters (39), Entities / Beings (37), Glowing Experiences (4), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), Retrospective / Summary (11), Combinations (3), General (1) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(cookie / food) 1.0 g Cannabis BODY WEIGHT:160 lbThere are better drugs out there than acid.ōYouÆre phone is fucked!öSo, this Friday started out on fairly mild terms. I finished classes, went to the bank, took a shower and developed a few songs on my guitar. A friend had mentioned that a few of his friends were going to be dosing later that day. The day was going well. I felt in the mood for a good trip, seeing as IÆd only tried it one other time in my life. I talked to my girlfriend, letting her know that I would see her later. The night was destined for excellence. I knew that things would go well.The preface is ironic only in a number of ways, but really not humorous in any. My night would severely obviate from the phrases ōmild termsö and ōgood tripö. In fact, these terms could not even begin to articulate what kind of terrible nightmare made reality I was to experience. I can honestly say that the serious advents of the night so sharply contrasted with my initial optimism that I will probably never live this night down in my prospective attendance to school.I ingested two hits of what I assumed to be pure, unadulterated Lazy Sunshine Dust dosed on Shock Tarts at approximately 4 in the afternoon this Friday. I felt a little tense, but fairly optimistic as usual. I was in a group of six. We hopped in some fellow collegiateÆs car and stopped at a gas station for smokes. We drove up into the mountains. A family of deer, including two protective bucks, were in our near vicinity. I thought that they might defend their females, so I was a little disoriented from that standpoint.Me and the group of guys found a pleasant outlook where we could see the city lights. Cars began to move in pulsing light beams across the country side. The heavy onset of smog reminded me of the misty Oregon coast. I felt good. Then, this vulgar asshole in the group starts adding dialogue to the already intense scene along the lines of ōI want to find Mordorö and ōI hate niggersö. I had apprehensive, bad feelings. I knew that the downward spiral was going to set in soon on the night.The Downward Spiral is a theory that I formulated in High School. During any given night out, there is an indefinite enjoyable phase that can be presumed. However, MurphyÆs Law will eventually sneak his way into that situation. That is where the indefinite downward spiral, precipitated mainly by drama, would take place and probably end in an unfulfilling night unless sleep is reached before that end. In brevity, this occurred on such ego-deflating basis and with such horrendous speed, that I can indefinitely say that this is the worst night of my life.I was suddenly separated from my one friend and was stuck in a group of assholes driving down from the mountains. The vulgar guy, was he there? Oh yeah, he was there. I heard his voice immediately. He stared at me manically, his fiery red hair and blank leer frightened me. The Dark Side of the Moon roared, patterns rippled across my vision like a kaleidescope, colors changed on a two-second basis. I couldnÆt decide whether or not I could bare to stay with these bastards, and I couldnÆt decide if I could make it back safely to my dorm under the influence of such powerful drugs.One of the guys wanted to crash. Tough shit. I was out on my ass and sent into a terrible mass of confusion. I circled around a lake 10 times in search of my dorm. My acid-addled brain wasnÆt ready to digest what had already happened and my consciencous, though now thoroughly sober, is suffering with the advents of the night. So, essentially, within the hour my prospective good trip cascaded into what could more appropriately relate to hellish nighmare. I somehow, in my incredibly erratic mindstate, felt impending doom. Colors spun heavily. I felt as though I had to change, to morph into some sort of chi, some oneness, some lifeforce. I meditate on a daily basis, so IÆm usually able to achieve mental equilibrium in altered states whenever I rarely indulge in them. I tried to meditate. Impossible. I realized that the previous generation had vacated the planet and gave the planet to my generation. I took an entire generationÆs environmental morality on my own acid-addled conscience and am regretting it as I type. I argued with my own roommate for no real reason and threw his Nalgene bottle again the wall. I am such a fucking idiot. Luckily, the only things injured, besides me, were the window of a 9-11 dispatch unit and my pride.So, I was suddenly stranded outside of my dorm building, naked. I had, undeniably, shed my clothes at some point and smashed all of the personal belongings in my pocket. I came to the realization that the previous generations were not only no longer on this Earth but they had deprived me of my clothing and personal belongings and had set my entire generation into this primitive Planet of the Apes netherworld. I was, in fact, wrong. It was just me and my shriveled manhood in the cold Colorado night ranting about saving the Earth or some bullshit illusion of grandeur that I was experiencing. I ran in front of a car and slammed my hands on the hood. I started yelling some psycho babble about saving the Earth or something.So, then I was detained by either some members of elusive past generations or government officials who were indefinitely going to send me to the looney bin forever. I cannot recall this part of the night accurately, but I can subjectively. I thought they were stopping me because I had committed the crime of being human. I repeatedly raved, ōis being human a crime?ö, ōthereÆs no crime against being human!ö. I thought that they were testing me. They werenÆt. They were actually very amiable enforcers of the law dealing with some raving, naked asshole college kid. I did not comprehend this until later.This part of the night becomes very blurry to me. I couldnÆt decide whether these people wanted to show me the care tips of taking responsibility for the Earth or whether they wanted to put me away in the slammer. I remember trying to escape the terrible grip of the government. I lashed out. I smashed my bare feet through the window of the cop car. I tried to lunge out and gashed my shoulder. I remember screaming, ōitÆs our fucking generation!ö. I was convinced that the government was impounding me right after the Earth had been passed ceremoniously to our generation. How fucking wrong was I? I was quickly forced to the ground, naked, face-first and lifted onto a stretcher against my maniacal, belligerent and probably comical protest. It was then that my hellish, Kafka-esque introspective nightmare began. I saw that there were big government officials in front of me. Their eyes stayed within menacing shades of red. Their tongues seemed to snake out at me. They began injecting me with strange fluids. Lethal injection: it was the best option I tried to transform into pure, white energy. I hoped for death. Better than the torture that would indefinitely await. I was handcuffed and bleeding. I saw the Christlike parallels. Stigmata. The needles reminded me of morphine injections reserved for was casualties. The broken glass dug into my wrists and back, They began to elevate my stretcher. I was going to be crucified. Fuck, oh dear.I must of been a real pain in the ass for the nurses, screaming bloody murder and convulsing like a loony. I heard the words, ōpsychiatric evaluationö, tossed around by some of the government folks. I was going to the sanitarium. I was getting booted out of school. I wanted nothing more than to fall asleep or to be euthanised. I laid in the hospital bed, hooked up to an IV, tubes up my nose, heart monitor going. Colors changed with great intensity, continually, every few seconds. I confronted the scenarios that I had not only probably severed all of my interpersonal relations with everybody in my life, was facing possible expulsion, was indefinitely facing disorderly conduct and indecent exposure charges, a possible eternity in a mental ward, but that I had left a group of friends on the same substance in the mountains. Now, thatÆs alot to lay on an acid-addled consciencous I bawled for at least 4 hours. IÆm sure the medical staff were laughing most of the time. I would have been.As it turns out, my dignity and blood were the only major donations made to the Downward Spiral on this faithful night. Nobody hates me, except possibly the officers and nurses involved in my detainment. My parents are none too pleased, but havenÆt severed communication with me. Well, I havenÆt talked to me girlfriend yet and donÆt have a phone right now, so I may have spoken too soon. Gossip spreads quickly. IÆm sure there are alot of campus sewing circles that my name will be circulating in.So, the night could have gone alot worse. I could be in jail right now being some leviathin monsterÆs bitch. IÆm going do as much as humanly possible to eliminate the tarnish of this one erratic act on my comprehensive educational career, as I pride myself implicitly as being level-headed and mild mannered most of the time. I canÆt really change the past, so I am considering this night a learning experience. Why am I writing about this? I feel like shit. I feel that the only way to satisfactorily purge my heavy conscious is to sit down and write, stream of thought, about the night. My face aches. My body is covered with meaty gashes, scrapes and tread marks from multiple IVs. I will be paying for the window of the police vehicle. I will be going to court and paying expenses. I am in such a depressive state right now that the only way I could fall asleep would be to write. I regret this night, but am glad to have survived it, that no one was injured and that the only major devastation lied solely on my ample medical bills.I also wrote this to clarify any rumors, which tend to ruminate quickly among the shit-stirring sewing circles which I truly and utterly despise. I did not sexually assault anybody, as did another student who took off his clothes on LSD. I shudder at the mere comparison between our infringements of the law. Our intentions were, obviously, completely different. Even mine, in my hallucinatory fugue, were fairly pure and ideological as opposed to vulgar, wanton, carnal. I canÆt really give a rational reason for my actions, apart from the fact that I was on LSD. I hope to be charged sparsely with infringements of the law, but expect the worse, as I have to take responsibility for my actions ridiculous actions. As the nurses say, I made a mistake and was just ōweird'.I can honestly say that this night was the worst of my life, the saving grace only being that I was not arrested and put into a holding cell for my disorderly conduct. I am hoping for the best and plan to partake in extensive community service, which I am apt to, in bettering myself and controlling my modes of thought. This is the first time that IÆve had a run in with the law, and I plan to make it the last. I was entirely out of sorts that night and I think half the campus will be letting me know about it all over again, come sunrise. I made a number of mistakes and now will have to endure the repercussions. I will take this experience as a learning experience and learn to better myself as a person through it. I would like to state that I have no moral objections to public nudity, even if it is near freezing outside. My unruly behavior was inexcusable and will be problematic for me in the ensuing months. Save to say, covered in stigma, currently colorblind and pounding headache, that I have successfully vanquished my curiousity regarding the potency of acid and have no desire in imbibing in such mind-altering drugs ever again and feel intensely at my uncharacteristic outburst. ōYouÆre phone is fucked!ö My roommate laments.Did I?

Some night.Exp Year: 2007ExpID: 66968Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 28, 2008Views: 32,310    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Various (28) DOSE:  smokedCannabis(plant material) 1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:75 kgThe first and so far only time I tried acid resulted in just about ruining my new years eve 2005/6 that I had been anticipating for the better part of 6 months. Some friends and I went to a drum and bass gig a few towns away, we had each got some acid and extacy to take over the two nights respectively.Nighttime fell on the first night (new years eve) and my friends decided to kick things off by hotboxing the van and having a session inside. My first mistake was to participate in this. I should probably preface this next part with an explanation of my relationship with marijuana - it always without fail makes me incredibly paranoid, introspective and unable to do anything physical without great effort. The only reason I keep doing it is social pressures and the hope that the next time will be different. Unfortunately it wasn't.I managed to put the tab in my mouth before the weed overtook my mind. People who tried acid from the same source we got ours all marvelled at how strong it was, and I was recommended just taking half my tab. Not listening to this was my second mistake. My girlfriend took a full tab and I didn't want to seem like a wuss, plus I usually have a high tolerance for alcohol and other substances, plus I was keenly looking forward to the psychotropic experiences I'd read about. Bring it on I thought. Jumping into something headfirst is something I always avoid from now on.We went to go dance, it was about an hour to midnight, and I was beginning to experience the uneasy feelings of the weed I smoked earlier. 'Why the fuck did I do this to myself... AGAIN?' I thought to myself, coupled with many other anxieties relating to the fear of ruining this night when there was so much anticipation toward it. I lost my 2 friends I came with and was just dancing with my girlfriend on autopilot while my mind was blocked into an introspective loop. My attention nervously shifted from the DJ on stage, to the crowd in front of me, to my girlfriend, to my own dancing, and back again. I worried about getting lost, I worried about bumping into people, I worried about making a fool of myself. I waited and wished dearly for the weed to leave my system, but this was obvioulsy not going to happen in a hurry, there were people all around me blowing weed smoke everywhere. Pricks.My internal monologue continued its paranoid rant as I began to wonder about the acid I just dropped. What if this horrible introspection I was feeling was a symptom of this new drug I tried? I tried to think logically and came to the conclusion that was I was feeling was more typical of feelings associated with weed (paranioa, introspection) than acid (hallucinations etc.) So basically at this point I was praying for the weed to wear off and hoping the acid would treat me better. This was new years for gods sake!My already fragmented hold on reality began to worsen around when the countdown for new years began. When midnight struck, I had planned to give my girlfriend next to me a big smooch as per tradition. When this happened however, I realised what a fucked up state I was in. I suddenly realised that I could barely see and was struggling to stand up. I managed to plant one on her and mumble 'Happy new years' but I was so unsure of what was going on I feared I had just kissed a total stranger in front of her. I tried to keep dancing and ignore my weakening physical state but I eventually realised that I was going to faint if I didn't do something. I quickly left my girlfriend and went outside of the dancing area to sit down and rest. I clutched my head and curled up under a tree, waiting for some of this poison to leave my body. I probably looked pretty foolish to those near me but I was out of it to sit up in any kind of dignified way. I sat there for probably half an hour hoping like hell I got better so I could enjoy the music I'd waited so long to experience.My girlfriend eventually found me asked what happened. to my surprise when I went to reply, I had lost my ability to speak. It took all of my mental energy to muster a sentence like 'This, I don't.... bad.' The fact she was tripping as well made it especially difficult to communicate. I was feeling so awful at this stage my hopes for recovering and having a good night had dispersed and I just wanted it all to go away. I tried my best to tell my girlfriend to take me back to the tent so I wouldn't just pass out in the open and risk being trampled or frozen overnight. Walking, speaking, finding my way around, in fact everything was just about impossible to do, I felt like I was in a dream. I kept blacking out, and began to fear that I would die, either from overdose or exposure. At one point there was no doubt I had reached the end of my life, and sadly thought of my poor mother having to deal with it.To make matters worse, finding our way back to our tent was a nightmare. All our friends we encountered were tripping as well and were of no help - I remember thinking, 'Fuck, is anyone at this gig NOT ON ACID?'. We got there eventually and I had a drink of water and curled up with a blanket and finally gave into the urge to pass into unconsiousness I had been feeling for the entirity of 2006.There you have it. For me the mixture of weed and acid basically caused me to black out and miss a concert I had waited many months and driven many miles for. Thankfully I recovered for the second night and had a great time on extacy. I haven't touched weed since this, nor will I ever probably. I may try acid again, but at a much smaller dose.Exp Year: 2005-2006ExpID: 53258Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 21, 2008Views: 9,494    LSD (2), Cannabis (1) : Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3), Rave / Dance Event (18) DOSE:  oralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:11 lbIt was the early 90's, and for the first time I had moved out of home. I was living with three friends in a rented house in southern England. The 'rave/acid house' culture was in full swing and I was not really part of it. The music meant nothing to me and the kind of people who seemed to frequent the illegal parties that my friends attended, were certainly not my crowd. I was 22 years old, and some may say quite old to be experiencing acid for the first time. The drug was always taken in our house on a Friday or Saturday night. Paper trips (blotters) seemed to be the only available acid. I didn't see a 'dot' for another year or so.It was on my fifth trip - taken for the fifth week in a row - that things went bad. So far my experiences had been good, and I couldn't see how it could ever be bad. I had not taken into account how important it was to be in the 'right mood' when taking the stuff. On this particular weekend, it was only me and one other friend tripping. Everyone else had been drinking heavily, and smoking pot all day. They didn't want to trip. This should have been enough to make me think twice about doing it on this occassion. The social factor was absent. I took two blotters and found myself 'coming up' very quickly, far quicker than usual. Within one hour I was feeling anxious. I tried playing board games, watching TV, as if trying to find a reality anchor to hold my sanity in place! My tripping companion was missing! I couldn't find him anywhere in the house and this increased my anxiety. I felt I could not relate to anybody else at the time. With my heart pounding I stepped into the garden. I called into house for someone to come and talk to me, feeling very self concious. One of my friends appeared at the garden door. 'You feeling ok?' he asked, the concern in his face was etched in like a stone carving, the lines on his forehead exagerated by the drug. 'No' I replied 'I think I'm drowning' It was at that point I looked skyward, and the dark blue sky suddenly became water. It was as if I had put the idea of drowing into my own head, by making what had been a fairly flippant remark. As I inhaled my lungs seemed to fill with water. I was gripped in terror as I gasped for air and fell to my knees. My friend caught me saying 'Whoa! You're NOT drowning Warren! You're NOT under water. Get your breathing under control. Nice and slow' It took me about five minutes - with his support to achieve this.By this time, the visuals were really kicking in. Nothing would stay still, and the inside of the kitchen seemed to be crawling with life. Insect life. The whole house was filthy anyway, and I was later told that two moths had been flying around the kitchen light, giving the impression of insect infestation and general chaos and disorder in what, I was very aware, was my home. The state of the place seemed to reflect my state of mind and compound my despair. Slowly returning to the kitchen, I was handed over to another friend. It was apparently his shift to get me under control. I still had no idea where my friend 'D' was (the other tripper) My new 'councellor' decided to help me up to my room, whereupon he ordered me to lie down. He put some music on and talked to me calmly, but as he sat at the end of my bed and talked, all the stripes on his tee shirt came away from the shirt and circled his head, like the rings of Saturn! I remember saying 'Oh Jesus, oh Jesus!' over and over again. I managed to calm down when Holsts 'Venus, bringer of peace' started playing on the CD my friend had put on.Finally I managed to make it back downstairs, and eventually bumped into my fellow tripper at last. 'How's it going?' I asked. He smiled nervously 'Not good, but it's past its peak now' At that moment there was a massive connection between the two of us. We had shared something, despite being apart, and had now come together again in this acknowledgement that all had not been good...but would be ok again. I can not describe the relief. The come down from thereon was scerene, and we both vowed not to trip again. As it happened we did, but it was never the same.Exp Year: 1992ExpID: 55057Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Apr 9, 2009Views: 9,246    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:4 linesinsufflatedCocaine(powder / crystals) 2.6 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:105 lbThe following is a recount of my experiences on the night of 2/12/08 and the subsequent morning. While I remember most of the night in vivid detail, I include only parts of the trip here for the sake of brevity. It was a boring Tuesday night and my friends S__ and J__ and I were hanging out in my dorm room feeding off of each other’s depression. Our first mistake was in deciding that cocaine would cure our ills. At around 7:00PM we began our yip-fest and over the next 30 to 45 minutes finished what J__ had with him, probably around 1.5 grams. After smoking lots of cigarettes, conversing at a mile a minute, and blasting hard techno on my sound system for a bit, we returned once again to the subject of our boring lives and more pertinent, the prospect of our quickly worsening Tuesday night. Out of coke and about to come down, we searched for other drugs to stave off the crash; ordinarily we would have gotten drunk, but once the conversation moved to the 8 hits of notably strong LSD in my freezer, I knew there was no turning back. Still high on coke, we made the executive decision to split the 8 strip of thick white blotter paper between the three of us (2 and 2/3 hits each) and thus began our trip at about 8:00PM.I suggested that we begin the come-up in the dark to the cliché yet exquisite sounds of dark side of the moon and thus began the spiritual journey. At the time, I had taken LSD in between 30 and 40 times, often several hits at once, but had never tripped as hard as I did then. I suspect now that the paper we ate that fateful night was more potent than the stuff I was used to, which combined with the quantity set me up for failure. I can usually detect the bright fuzzy colors and stomach-swelling of a come up around 30-40 minutes after I have dosed, but this time I experienced a sickening distortion in the pit of my gut halfway through ‘on the run’ only 15-20 minutes after taking the hits. We turned the lights back on and agreed that the trip was unexpectedly intense and that we would be in for a long night. After realizing that by taking the elevator, we would risk riding with sober people, we elected to take the 15 flights of stairs down to street level. Upon breaking out into the open, I remembered that New York was at the time amidst a blizzard, and we stared around in mildly apprehensive bewilderment at the chaotic scene of downtown Manhattan. After briefly attempting to light a cigarette, I threw it to the ground and closed my eyes overcome with the intensity of the body high. I looked up to the black sky as a thick ethereal breeze engulfed my body and swirled around me, then back at my friends as our gazes met, all slack jawed, our bodies awkwardly rigid.We realized that negotiating with the security in my building for every cigarette break or adventure would be impossible and that we would have to relocate our trip. Considering the hostile outdoor environment, we decided to hike to the apartment of one of J__’s friends, M__. The 10 block excursion was nerve wracking but amazing. We all concurred that we had never tripped close to that hard and that we were uneasy about the prospect of being in that state all night. We arrived at the apartment but were told that we had to leave for an hour because our host would be busy with something personal. It was as we left that I became aware that something was amiss with my mental state and ability to function adequately. In attempting to explain the ground breaking conclusions I was reaching with every passing second, my friends stared at me blankly or laughed. I realized that once an idea crossed the boundary between thought and words, it completely fell apart and made no rational sense to others. The result was that I would begin to explain something but stop mid sentence after either realizing its lack of coherency or forgetting what I was talking about. We settled down in the warmth of a subway station on a wooden bench and gawked at the aliens making their way to and fro for a small while, and then set about determining the time that had passed. All three of us were quite uneasy about being in public and couldn’t wait to return to the warmth and seclusion of M__’s apartment. I was aware of the phenomenon of being slightly confused and spacey while tripping, but we were hopeless. I determined that our two primary goals were to one, figure out what time it was, and two, figure out what time we had left the apartment. But this was no use; we were so distracted that we struggled with the concept for what must have been close to 20 minutes before giving up and venturing outside once again. After standing soaking wet in the snow and mind-numbing winds and intermittently grappling with the confusion of a phone conversation with M__, our ticket out of the frosty hell, we made it back to the apartment on time. I had a briefly terrifying moment before going inside in which I convinced myself that another tenant of the building had called the cops on account of our suspiciously psychotic behavior loitering by the doorway. As a result, I took off and booked it down the street chased by swirling blue and red lights and sirens before my friends caught up with me and dragged me out of my delusion and back into the building. I was so thankful to be inside that I lay face-down on the floor for a while enjoying the ripples of energy coursing through the wood and the explosions of color inside my eyelids. We conversed for a bit but the more time I spent thinking, the less I could speak. I would sit in the corner and become immersed in someone’s conversation, forgetting my physical existence completely. I would often misinterpret and twist the subject of someone’s discussion to be that of some unexplained grave danger that we were in, like when I thought the cops were chasing us. I asked everyone in the room several times, “is it serious?” after greatly misjudging the severity of a look of disappointment or frustration on someone’s face. I was startled when M__, our babysitter asked me if I was ok, because up to that point I had assumed my state was no worse than that of my friends. This experience became the spawn of a rain of doubt regarding my sanity. Only a minute or so of deep thought after this statement, she opened her mouth to speak to me again but her voice slowed and then sped up as if being scratched on a record, rendering her words then, and all speech thereafter, completely unintelligible to me. This freaked me out beyond belief as I had never experienced hallucinations of this severity, so I stood up abruptly and looked around to see how my friends were reacting to the craziness, but was met only with concerned stares.As my subconscious raged forward, dragging me from thought to thought with uncontrollable speed, I found myself getting so caught up in my own hypothetical situations that I lost track of which ‘reality’ was accurate and which were just my wandering guesses as to what could happen. In an attempt to back-track along my rapid chain reaction of delusions to reality, I just became more lost in my brain’s muddled theories—all of my senses completely consumed by each hallucination. My world of suppositions manifested itself visually as a sort of ‘electric sheep’-esque jumble of neon lines, ever twisting and morphing 3-dimensionally with new branches of possible scenarios multiplying by the millions, each fading in and out super-imposed over the others. I very quickly deduced that I had gone mad. I thought that insanity was just a jolt slightly out of one’s native reality; this offset forced me to float endlessly along the infinite rift never knowing quite which parallel reality was the real one, but always just one step behind. This idea fit in with the conception that whenever a decision is made, a new parallel universe spawns for each possibility. This results in a tree of absolutely unfathomable size of which our universe is only the end of one twig at any given point in time. I had always wondered about those who talk to imaginary people on the subway, and it all became clear that night. I thought I was a new member of the club and we would all share this disconnect from reality together. I had momentary visions of staring up from a stretcher and seeing my parents leaning over me, silhouetted by the bright hospital lights. I assumed that I would only have these momentary glimpses of my original reality but would be mostly trapped in my dysfunctional brain for the rest of my life. I saw a masked doctor with thin spectacles approaching my face with a long thin glass tube and I gagged as he forced it down my throat. I was blinded as the world filled up with brilliant white light and multicolored stars arcing over my field of vision, and my ears began to ring as the volume of my roaring auditory hallucinations peaked. I felt like sobbing but could not make a sound, I had let my family down—I took too many drugs and now it was too late—I would never see them again.Evidently, my two tripping companions were so freaked out that they tried to call 911, but were fortunately dissuaded by our host, who had seen the effect before and knew that time was the only cure. In retrospect, a trip to the local emergency room would not have helped things. They held my hands and called to me trying to catch my wandering gaze, but I just stared off into the cosmos, my head wobbling slightly. I proceeded to spend the next few hours navigating my alien planet trying to find a way out, whilst my friends periodically beckoned to me in vain staring in to my (un)seeing eyes. After a while, I reasoned that I was, and always had been, a single consciousness separate from or devoid of all senses—a brain in a jar, and thus effectively alone in the universe. I thought that because I had discovered this sickening truth, I could never forget and go back. I felt my stomach drop upon the realization that all of my friends and family had always been simply creations of my own disturbed mentality, but even more so that I would be alone for all of eternity with only my thoughts to accompany me. My friends tell me that I staggered around the room while moving my arms as if climbing through a dense jungle, and made futuristic spacey sounds with my mouth which I perceived then to be the noise of passing fluidly between thousands of layers of realities.From the outside, I was apparently speaking gibberish under my breath and roaming around the room agitatedly. But on the inside, I was walking around what I believed to be my own imagination staring with longing sadness at the ideas that I had mistaken to be my friends all my life. As I had aged, my brain fashioned a different interpretation for every concept that I learned, each experience and companion becoming a stepping stone in what I perceived to be the story of my life. Unfortunately, that day my compounded knowledge was finally broad enough to allow me to realize the gravity of the situation, and I would have to live with this reality for all of eternity. I thought back on all the memories I had amassed laughing, playing, and arguing with friends with a mixture of longing grief and horrifying revulsion. The truth was too much; I thought about how I had taken my reality-based life for granted dreading only petty grievances but had never even come close to guessing the severity of my fate. Fairly early on this nightmare, I completely forgot that LSD was at all involved as I was for some reason completely convinced and thus consumed by the anguish of meeting my grim fate. This almost immediate irrational loss of hope could probably be explained by the come down from the coke. After about an hour and a half, some more friends were invited over and started drinking. My friends tell me that I interacted vaguely with the inebriated newcomers staring blankly or pointing and mumbling to myself. I remember wishing so intensely for the end of my terrifying trip that I tried to terminate my life, realizing to my dismay that a being cannot manipulate its own tangible existence if it has no physical ties to reality. While I was sitting on the couch, my friend handed me a cup of water but I tried to dive into it hoping it to be a portal out of my insanity. In reality, I just pressed my hands together pointing into the cup as if to dive into it, and spilled it all over myself and the bed I was sitting on. A couple people thought I had pissed myself but after relocating me to the floor and smelling the sheets, they deduced that it was just water from the cup. I also became very hot and restless as I had been constantly clenching my muscles in torment, so I attempted to walk through my clothes, which seemed reasonable at the time. In reality, however, I just pulled and twisted at my clothes for about 20 minutes until I managed to get my jacket, hoodie, and shirt off. I then sat half-naked on the couch staring into space and sporadically burying my face in my hands and the armrest. My experience here was a strange and seemingly random fluctuation from extreme euphoria more intense than even any roll I have ever had, and unexplained mental agony more intense and horrible than anything I had ever experienced. I believe this to be the deepest part of the trip as my malfunctioning cortex reached a peak of chaos and misfiring neurons.By far the worst part of the trip, this odd split-second oscillation lasted for what seemed to be an eternity while I frantically grappled with my quickly scarring brain trying anything that I thought might have even a remote chance of alleviating my state. Retrospectively, one of the scariest aspects of my night is that I knew I would give anything to die, and could have seriously hurt myself or worse. Believing that I had been not only myself but everyone else in my life growing up, I thought that regaining a sense of identity might help. I was surprised and momentarily calmed to read familiar names in the contact list of my phone after taking it out of my pocket, and put the device in my mouth in a desperate attempt to consume this pleasing reality. Searching for patterns in the fluctuations, I thought for a bit that subject of my thoughts had an obscure and twisted relationship with the state of my mood and tried to figure out the nature of the pattern. I passed rapidly over random concepts and words in my mind and spoke them aloud in order to try and instigate a mental reaction, stopping briefly on obscure and sweeping concepts that seemed to resonate such as three, life, music, love, and god. The only consistent correlation I found, however, was between focused thinking and better mental stability. I found that if I gave up and let go, my subconscious was allowed complete control of my focus sending me spiraling through a vortex of bizarre and disturbing images and thoughts, while if I made a significant effort to focus my energy on a rational idea or memory desperately staving off distraction, I was more calm and level-headed. This balance was manifested visually as a slippery balance beam that I was charged to walk along, weary though I was, without sliding down the sharp slopes into the infinite abyss on either side; it is reminiscent of grinding a rail in Tony Hawk. After about five total hours of feverish schizo-hell, to everyone’s surprise and relief, I managed to blurt out in comprehensible English that I was going to go home. Intending to rush to the dorms before I lost my sense of reality once again, I opened the apartment door and stumbled down the stairs of the building outside into the cold. S__, who lived in my dorm as well pulled on his shoes and took off in hot pursuit, believing me to be the victim of some terrifying delusion that might chase me in front of a speeding taxi or into a couple of cops. I slowed to a brisk walk and he caught up. I said “man I feel like I just woke up” twice but otherwise, we finished the 25 minute walk in silence trudging through the icy sludge. For the duration of the walk I assumed the worst, expecting not to reach my dorms on account of not being back in reality yet. He asked if I wanted to make some pasta as we entered the elevator in our building, but I responded that I wasn’t hungry and really just needed to pass out. Before departing at his floor, I told him that I would be curious to find out his side of the story the next morning and that I would divulge mine as well. I was confused when I came to realize that I was definitely in reality because I couldn’t remember a clear-cut point at which I came back. I just knew that I was gone, and then I noticed that I was back, so a large part of what I had assumed to be delusion could have actually been real.Surprisingly, though I was still tripping, I had little trouble falling into a light restless sleep, probably on account of my extreme fatigue. About four hours later, I woke up to my alarm and had to go to physics class. I felt displaced and uncomfortable all day as if I was still not totally sure I was in the correct parallel universe, and had great difficulty communicating with my friends normally. A mild after-image of this feeling stuck with me for about a month before it faded to a mostly unnoticeable level. I also had nightmares for several weeks and was worried for a while that my brain had been permanently damaged. I made several mistakes that night and consider it without doubt to be the worst night of my life, but at the same time value the things I learned about myself greatly. If confronted with those decisions again, I would definitely act differently, however I do not regret the night as I feel it shaped a part of who I am now. I was humbled by the experience and treat drugs differently now. I value my sanity and embrace life knowing that it was just a nightmare. I treat others differently as my ability to empathize was greatly augmented when I perceived all others to be part of my own consciousness. Not to be pious or cliché, but I realize more now that everything is a matter of perception; if one experiences what he/she believes to be absolute fact, there is always another angle from which there is a different and equally valid truth.I tried one hit of acid five weeks later and found it to be a stressful situation not worth the trouble. I had to concentrate heavily to hold on to reality and even lost it for about 30 minutes 2 or three hours into the trip before I was able to grab hold again. I have decided that I have reached my threshold and can therefore no longer enjoy tripping on acid. In addition, I consider LSD to now be a danger to my mental health and will not do it again. I am disappointed greatly because of my prior love of the drug, but am content with the fact that I am probably better off without its presence in my life. I would recommend nothing but extreme moderation with regard to LSD. Before this trip, I had countless wonderful and enlightening experiences with acid and I thought I knew its power. I had even seen other people go ‘round the bend, but assumed naďvely that I was above all that. At this point in time, two of my friends have had similar experiences and cannot enjoy acid anymore either. The chemical has perplexed scientists for decades with its unpredictability and extreme potency, and it has been suggested that it can push people with a possible predisposition over the edge into permanent schizophrenia. I consider myself lucky to be ok now, because by the time you find out that you have a schizoid predisposition, it may be too late. My dad’s half-sister died in a mental institution, and it is believed that she was thrown into schizophrenia by LSD use.From my personal experience with LSD, I would suggest that one of the only ways to keep one grounded in reality is to keep his/her mind working. If you or a friend is slipping away, thinking and most importantly conversing with others actively can be very effective. I have tried mushrooms and MDA in moderate doses since without any sort of schizophrenic psychosis. I believe LSD itself to be my problem, not tripping.Exp Year: 2007ExpID: 70185Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jun 4, 2009Views: 77,289    LSD (2) : Therapeutic Intent or Outcome (49), Post Trip Problems (8), Overdose (29), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:3 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab) 3 bowlssmokedCannabis(plant material) 7 bowlssmokedCannabis - Hash(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:155 lbThe events that follow were after I consumed 3 hits of unbelivably strong acid.Yesterday I had the craziest trip of my life, it started by running through miles of woods with no idea where we were going, it didn't matter, we were free, sprinting through the woods like tribesman with no care in the world, the sun was peaking through the canopy and I was with two of my best friends one of whom was being introduced to the world of psychadelics. I felt like an animal, I didn't have to think where each step would go my mind would see an area of terrain and would instinctually make sure that I made the right step, I was galloping at full speed wisping in and out of the brush winding in and out of trees hurdling over logs nature was one with me and I was one with nature.While we ran we were singing and yelling what sounded like tribal chants creating waves of vibrations that intertwined with the nature of the forest with the consciousness of all. There was positive archaic nature energy all around my 2 friends and I it was as if we had energy fields and we meshed with the forest, one of my favorite parts was climbing a 15 foot tree and overlooking the entire canopy and the ground watching the life emerge beneath the leaves it was as if everything was alive and thriving. My friends and I at one point hugged this gigantic near 100 foot tree for about 3 minutes meshing with the ancient energy of this tree. As we were running and chanting with not a care in the world I was trying to explain my ideas of consciousness, the universal oneness of everything and the duality that exists in everything. It seemed as if my linguistic ability had evolved, everything flowed together with a rhythm, my mind was on point. Every word was connatated with a feeling and a visual, I was trying to describe to my friends the pure radiant light of empathy and love and inter-connectedness with everything. As I described it, it felt like the feeling was re-emerging into all three of us, the sea of infinite pure radiant energy was showing its true nature to us. I explained the duality in everything, night and day, sun and moon, up and down, left and right, awake and asleep, conscious and unconscious, life and death, the paridox of everything.I told them to imagine the 5 chakras as a life force that flowed from the abdomen through the spine as an open flow of energy to the crown chakra and I explained the colors connated with the chakras and the feelings associated with those colors. I told them to imagine this life force flowing to the crown chakra and out of the body through the pineal gland into the sea of light, how I let go of individualistic, materialistic desire, to free myself of negativity, to focus on the pure light.After about three hours of running through the forest we decided it was time to head back. We finally made our way out of the woods and through campus back to the apartment. When we were discussing the trip, the woods and life we felt like there was some sort of telepathy between us, we could finish each others sentances. We could read each others body langauges, there was no avoiding truth, a negative feeling was seen just as it was, there was no avoiding truth, truth was translucent for all to see. We turned on some loud surround sound music and just veged out feeling the vibration of the music consume us. About an hour of hanging in the apartment 2 more people showed up as well as a dealer with more acid and the 2 new people consumed hits and the dealer talked to us about how he ate 20 hits and wouldn't think twice about eating an entire sheet. To me this was insane and there was a negative energy about him, he didn't seem to be observing the beauty of things or to be looking for introspective psycho-analysis he seemed to be escaping his life and he looked as if his brain was mangled. He had a dull facial expression and signs of sorrow in his eyes.After the new people entered the apartment things started to go south for me, it seemed as one of the people who had entered the apartment had a very negative aura. Every time I was close to him its as if his aura was feeding on mine, my entire body would get hot and I felt as if something was ripping at me and trying to tear me apart. I was not the only one to feel this, my friend J also felt as I did, he looked at me multiple times and he didn't even have to say anything, he felt it to. The only thing on my mind at this point was to remove myself from the negative energy and to return back to nature. I left the apartment and sat on the stoop to smoke a cigaret with J. Both he and I were mystified at how there was this very negative energy surrounding and consuming P. I have been friends with P for a long time but there was something about him that wasn't right. J had a great positive aura and our energies meshed to form an even better energy. I was starting to enjoy my trip again when P exited the apartment and came outside with us. Instantly this hot horrible energy was consuming me, my mouth was dry and I felt this overwhelming feel of dread the only thing on my mind was to get away from P. J and I would walk away from him and P would follow not understanding what the problem was and we didn't want to tell him because most people won't react very well if you tell them they have an extremely negative aura about them and we don't want to be near it. Especially when he just consumed 3 hits of acid so that he could trip with us. After a while it seemed as if P gave up and returned back to the apartment to hangout with Z and the others. J and I were trying to decide what to do because we couldn't be with this negative energy, it was creating this awful feeling of dread and all I wanted to do was leave. We went inside to borrow someone's phone and as we enter I was instantly confronted with this wave of unbearably hot energy flowing throughout this dark apartment with surround sound death metal and P grotesqley chewing this brownie. He wasn't talking of positive he was seeing the negative in everything, gorging himself and being demeaning while listening to hardcore death metal. This honestly freaked me out beyond belief I have never been confronted with such a negative, hot, awful energy it was as if was pure evil and trying to wrap himself around me and deplete my positive energy. I was not going to let this happen I immidiately left the apartment. J and I started to trip each other out with the negative energy and the only thing we could talk about was getting a ride out of here and going to his roomates birthday party, we ended up walking around the neighborhood and talking about the negative energy and positive vs. negative. This is when J also started to turn negative he wanted to return the house and his aura was repelling mine, this freaked me out to another degree, I asked him if he wanted to be good and he started to walk away from me. He started to head toward the negative energy in the apartment so I took off the other way. This is when I started to go apeshit.I entered this unbelievable headtrip the only thing I wanted to do was bathe myself in the pure sea of light, to escape the constraints of the physical world. I wanted to have full dissolution of the ego. All I could think about was God and being closer to him, I wanted to join back with the universe and God and all the good entities of the cosmos. I started to sing in this loud archaic voice expressing my love for the omnipotent, praising the universe, crying out for the negative, I was consumed by this unbelivable powerful primordial energy that was exploding within me. At this time the blades of grass turned into millions, the frame of apartments shifted and intertwined, it was getting dark and reality seemed to be like a carnival. I saw this gigantic white light and knew that I had to go near it I had to enter into the light it was the only thing to do to escape the negativity all around me. As I got closer to the light I felt this strong urge to merge with it, to become one with it, to cease to exist to leave the physical realm. This is when my head slammed into the light post and I was knocked unconscious.When I woke up there were cops and paramedics all around me, I felt as if I was watching my body. I thought this was it, I thought I was dead. There was 4 police officers and a few paramedics huddled around me asking me all these questions. I thought these were the gatekeepers. I thought that I was only able to see them now because I was dead. I thought they were here to either take me to hell or to take me to heaven (this isn't necessarily the catholic or any version of heaven or hell it was just the negative or the positive). They asked me all these questions and at this point my pupils had to be quarters, I was peaking off of 3 hits of very very strong acid and had been smoking hash and pot all night.They thought I was drunk but I certainly wasn't drunk, they asked me if I had been smoking crystal or doing heroin or tripping or smoking crack, I eventually must of uttered the words that I was tripping on acid because they eventually found out. I kept asking if they were the good people, and at this point it gets a little fuzzy and I honestly think they thought the situation to be quite humorous and weren't doing anything to make me any more calm. They put handcuffs on me extremely tight and kept shining a light in my eyes and saying wierd stuff. I thought that the gatekeepers had decided that I was not good, that I was a bad person so they must take me to hell. At this point I started to struggle I tried to run away and I nearly succeeded as I was tripping balls and I'm in pretty good physical shape, the three male police officers ended up restraining me and throwing me in the back of the car.The entire ride to the police station is extremely extremely fuzzy, the police officer didn't say a word the entire time and It didn't even click that I was being taken to jail. What my mind kept telling me is I was dead, and I was being sent to hell because the primordial energy force had decided I was bad. This freaked me the fuck out. I also didn't realize that in my pocket was about 20g of hash and a bowl, I wouldn't find this out till the next morning.After pulling into the police station I was pretty much in and out of awareness. I remember them putting the jump suit on me and laying on the concrete ground. Eventually I was lead to a cell and they told me to walk in, I entered and then realized (in my mind) that this was a hell cell, I had to do anything I possibly could to get myself out of there. So before he shut the door I ran out, he put me back in the cell but I ran out again. I was not going to go willingly into this hell cell, there was no way. Eventually he managed to get the helldoor shut and I was locked in this concrete room with a not even foot by foot window on the cell door. There was dirt and sticky shit all over the metal bench and beds. And a metal toilet with brown dirt and rings all over it.At this point I nearly went insane, as far as I knew I was in hell, locked away in this room forever, it was hot in the cell, there was constant running water that dripped as if it was chinese water torture. There were all kinds of people that I couldn't see (in my mind hell beings) that were coughing and weezing and banging on the doors and then I hurd blood curdling screams (I think this was auditory hallucinations from the barely audible TV that seemed to be somewhere off in the distance). So peaking in a nasty jail cell with water dripping and screams and pounding while believing I was in hell freaked me the fuck out. The only thought in my mind was to call out to god and the universe and beg for mercy to plead with the life force to let me out. Everyone I had ever encountered in my life was visualized I tried to picture my interactions with them good and bad. I felt that I had lived a good life, always trying to think about others and to treat people with respect, I loved people, I loved my girlfriend I tried to do anything I could to help my Mom I just didn't understand why I had been sent to hell. I started to sing I love God, I am sorry for all the negative I have done, I want to be with you (this sounds a bit corny but think about what you would do if you were locked in a jail cell peaking on 3 hits of strong acid and thought that you were in hell and hallucinating people screaming) and I was singing it in the best most passionate primordial voice I could. I did this for hours (these people probably thought I lost my fucking marbles but they didn't understand what was going through my head).At one point I stopped singing and started to look at this small mirror and my faced was completely flushed, hair was going in 9 diferent directions, pupils were quarters and my face was morphing into all kinds of evil things. This took me to another level, I thought this meant I truly was evil, that God was right, and that I deserved to be tortured and stuck here forever without food or water. I believed that if I drank out of the faucet that I would start to weeze like the other people (I think they were weezing because they were cigaret smokers for 20 years and smoked meth). One more thing I did to confirm that I was in hell was check the tag on my jumpsuit and it seemed as if the maker of the jumpsuit was a primordial joke. It said made by Bob Barker (I thought Bob Barker from price is right this was just done as a joke by the evil force) and underneath that it said tumble dry (I thought hell and dryness... obviously that was the washing directions but I didn't understand at the time).Eventually I started to come down and was wondering if I was really in Hell or if it was just a jail cell, at this point recalling the gatekeeper encounter it was so funny. I wouldn't figure out everything till I talked to people who watched me get arrested and until I talked with the cops. Eventually I got a cop to talk to me for 15 minutes because I told her I was going insane, I thought god sent me to hell and I didn't understand what I had done. She told me I was in jail and I would be let out in about 12 hours. This instantly made me come down and I felt 300% better, I thanked her for giving me a minute and telling me what had happened and what was going on. She proceeded to tell me drugs ruin lives and she knows of people who did drugs one time and became addicted yada yada yada drugs are bad.The rest of the night was uneventful and was spent pacing the cell and meditating on everything that had happened. The next morning I bailed myself out and was let out, I learned that I was charged with Drug paraphanalia, and disorderly conduct for trying to run away. What I thought was quite humorous is I wasn't charged for the hash and it was left in my pants pocket. I walked to McDonalds ordered some food and told the guy at the register what happened he offered to drive me back to my college and I payed him in hash for the ride. Craziest night of my life, will never ever do acid again.Exp Year: 2008ExpID: 72910Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Aug 31, 2009Views: 36,275    LSD (2), Police / Customs (60) : Bad Trips (6), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:1 bowlsmokedCannabis(plant material) 1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab) 1 bowlsmokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:150 lbLast night was by far the most traumatic night of my entire 19 year old life. My good friend Loren’s birthday was that night. He worked night security at a hotel in San Diego County. I can remember the night like I was still living it at this very moment.I sat at my house alone, playing the newly released videogame Fallout 3. The videogame which my girlfriend has purchased me for Christmas. Before I know it, Andrew had shown up at my house telling me we were going to go visit Loren on his shift for his birthday. He worked at ten o clock (at night), it must have been nine thirty or so by the time we were leaving my room.We started by smoking a bowl of marijuana through Andrew’s bong in my parked car in the driveway. I got high as a kite as we made the transfer to Andrew’s “Squirly-Drifter”, a 1987 Nissan 200SX. The hood taped on with no back window, and brakes that make small children cry. On the way to San Diego I was at this point completely “domed out” and higher than ever.We had decided to get Loren a hit of LSD for his birthday, and we committed to doing it since neither of us had obligations (Besides Loren being at work). So, we called our LSD connect and cruised up to his house in San Diego, buying 3 hits of LSD, at ten dollars each. We drove to the hotel, and found Loren sitting in a chair bundled up in jackets. The temperature must have been close to freezing. We were all layered in multiple jackets. I had on a t-shirt, then a warm pajama top with another jacket along with some heavy jeans. It didn’t stop the cold from penetrating our bodies and causing the deepest shiver I’ve ever known. This was before we even took the LSD. We then presented Loren with a hit of LSD. We began to make a patrol around the hotel, and we all popped the blot-papers on our tongue. We all did one hit. We let it soak in and started taking in our surroundings.A good half hour went by and nothing really happened. I was still high and wondering how the trip would begin and how it would end. Another twenty minutes or so, we just sat in chairs viewing the parking lot and pool. The visuals would soon begin. Upon looking at the neon-lit hotel signs, I began to see swirls and distortions in the signs. As we began walking around more, the environment began to transform all around me. How it became a bad trip was a mystery to me. I had done acid twice in the past. The first time was by far the best, a euphoric trip. The second time was not good.I began to lose complete control over my mind. Loren and Andrew were the only shred of reality I saw. The outside world was nothing, a big dream of hallucinations and repetitions of my mind. At most I would only see half the real world, and everything else was complete hallucinations. I was becoming scared. Really scared. Andrew and Loren recalled most of my experience saying that I walked around in awe, frightened out of my gourd. I would say their names, confirming who they are and nothing else.I lost control over life, and would occasionally slip back into it for seconds at a time, immediately returning to knowing nothing, and literally going crazy. Walking was now a nightmare. I would follow Andrew and Loren with them being the only clear path, everything else around me was surreal. Walking up a quick flight of stairs to the second story of the hotel became a psychotic experience. I placed my hand on the railings only to feel my hand liquify with the railing itself, and seeing the railing disappear altogether. I walked up the stairs, and began following Loren and Andrew down the corridor of hotel rooms, the corridor twisting, doors changing shapes. At some point we emerged in the housekeeping room, where there was a bathroom and a heater inside. We found refuge here for a short while.It seemed the reason I was so scared was that Andrew and Loren were on a completely different level than I. None of them saw anything. Their mood was affected, that was it. No visualizations. I then next remember constantly walking back to Andrew’s car to try and fall asleep. Falling asleep on acid was horrifying. I can’t even begin to describe the things I was seeing. My mind was then put on hold. All of a sudden I had no feeling over my body, it was like watching my life through a TV. I began to experience events more than once, twice, three times. I saw myself and my friends walking and doing things we had just done earlier.At the heaviest point in the trip, I would be walking with minor vision of the real world and heavy hallucinations. The street became infinitely wider, bushes grew and things were so bright and detailed. With a quick stare, things would glow, and look like a 3D graphic animation. At this point I was near insanity. Questioning life, wondering if I was going to stay like this for the rest of my life. I had believed that the end of my life was near, had even questioned killing myself.I had entered Andrew’s car and sat back in the chair and alternated between the two at least 5 times. Whenever entering the car and grabbing the door handle, the car would twist and bend as if it was a big stick of black taffy, I became so lost I just stood there lying against the car door with my hand on the handle. Trying to make sense of anything, I forced myself into the car again and again, randomly opening the door handle to get out and immediately recoiling and closing the door to try to protect myself from myself. At this point there was more walking to be done. I had to hold Andrew’s hand in order to get anywhere because walking in real life was impossible. I would see the real world, and it would immediately be clouded by my thoughts, which became 100 percent visual. My thoughts would pile on top of each other and fill into my eyes, making it so I could see nothing but blurs of past thoughts. At one point, upon looking at a stucco wall my vision became full of nothing but a twirling stucco wall, and I had no idea where I was. I just stood there in awe, and my friends would try and make me come to.Time took forever to go by, absolutely forever. It would feel like an hour from 2:30 AM to 2:40. I was pleading with myself to not go crazy, to try and realize that there is life on the other side when this is past. There was a shred of reality I wouldn’t let myself lose hold on…and if I did it would have ended in absolute insanity for much longer than the trip itself. Visuals were off the wall. I would see half of a building and the rest of it blurring and swirling into my past thoughts. I began thinking of my girlfriend and that she would never love me if I was like this. I was so sad, and so scared.I managed to force myself to stay in Andrew’s car. They had known something was wrong with me, so they escorted me into the car and put the car cover over it so I could have some alone time to try and keep it cool and come down. The car cover was like a prison, I felt as if I would never be able to escape the car. The next thing I remember after that, I was climbing out of the back of the car and it was about 5:50, ten minutes left for Loren to finish his shift. We talked about how he would never do acid at work again, that it stresses him out and I questioned as to why they didn’t have a trip anything like mine. He told me what I was doing, and I remembered strings of it.Andrew was passed out in the car, I was beginning to come down and grab a hold of reality again and began to recollect on what just happened. I tried to stress to Loren that I had a near death experience. Eventually we woke Andrew up and we all departed the hotel, my trip began to change. Imagine the following in absolutely freezing temperatures, yet a perfectly sunny and gorgeous blue morning: All I could think about was Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, because that’s exactly what we were. Tripping on acid, driving a car and freaking out. I was on constant panic watch for police, and the visuals I began to see were so vivid. There were no more full on hallucinations, just accelerated senses and brighter colors.[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] We were hauling down the 5 north freeway at around 100 miles per hour on acid, with Loren following behind on his motorcycle, following so close he could touch the car. There was no doubt in my mind that what we were doing had the consequence of death if not done right. Andrew’s hood was tied onto the car with THIN string. I was becoming very frightened that the hood would fall off onto the freeway. At the speed peak, the hood was literally 4 inches in the air being held on by a thread of string. Luckily, it didn’t fly off. If it did, there would have probably been an accident. We stopped at Loren’s house and went into the room which he rents from a family.Loren had lost the care to maintain a squeaky clean room. There were dirty plates everywhere, bottles full of pure urine (Apparently someone was in the bathroom when he needed to urinate) and the room needed a cleaning so bad he straight up spit on his floor for no reason. We all found tons of laughter in his room’s state. Loren wanted to stay and sleep, we forced him to leave.At this point we began talking about girls. Andrew and I both have our girlfriends, and Loren had his one love leave him a year ago when she went to college. We decided to make the day a new day for him. We took all the pictures they had together, all the notes she left him (Obsessively written notes, by the way. With multiple color pens, many entries on paper that was folded into a swan) and put them into a FedEx box. We left the house after a good while and began our commute on the 101 home.What was to occur was frightening fear of getting rolled by the police. Our highs were coming down, so we smoked another bowl of weed. Andrew was lighting up as he passed through an intersection, directly in front of a cop who happened to not be looking as she was making a right turn on a red light. He sped away from the immediate area and continued down the 101. We saw two motorcycle cops on the right hand side sitting there, talking. As we passed, they both began riding behind us at a distance. We became frightened, took a right, and fortunately they passed.I was rapidly gaining consciousness and wanted to go home and sleep. I did have to hang out with my girlfriend…in fact as I type this now, I am planning on hanging out with her too. In a nutshell, we went to Wal Mart and purchased amazing tasting candy. We then walked to Best Buy. We then drove to the mall, and burned the reminders of Loren’s ex. Security came and said we couldn’t set fire in the parking lot. He looked like he was calling the cops, so Andrew then took me home. I came home, showered, slept for a couple hours, and am now writing this. What an experience for the books…. The experience was so traumatizing I have serious doubts I will ever do LSD again. I will remember it for the rest of my life.Exp Year: 2008ExpID: 76019Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 19 Published: Sep 2, 2009Views: 7,879    LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:00  oralLSD(liquid)  T+ 6:0030 mgoralHydrocodone(liquid)  T+ 6:0020 mginsufflatedKetamine(powder / crystals)BODY WEIGHT:150 lbI have tried just about 'everything' in the past 2 years from Cannibis to Datura and Heroin. I have never lost control of myself while under the influence. However this night was nothing like before.I had just gotten into town and called up a really good friend of mine to find some Acid. We showed up at his distributers house where he handed us 3 vials of acid which still had a ton of LSD left in them. We both took the droppers and cleaned the vials. About 5 minutes later we took the vials and rinsed them with non-chlorinated water. We rinsed them about 3 times until we couldn't taste the sweetness of the alchohol it was cut with, leaving nothing left.We probably ingested about 30 hits each of LSD total, then we said our farewells and headed back to my friends house. Now about 15 minutes after taking this LSD we were already starting to feel it which was obvious we were going to be fucked. We were rising and rising on the plateau of inebriation and about 3 hours have passed and we are STILL rising, feeling super energetic, unable to complete simple tasks, and hallucinating like I have never experienced before.We went outside for a little bit where it was raining, and I would look at the sidewalk and notice that flowers of such vibrant and beautiful colors were growing and breathing. There were so many patterns and confusion from the LSD I would forget where I was. The 'trails' I was experiencing were lasting about 30-40 seconds. I constantly heard techno-industrial music playing but it was dead silent except for the rain pouring down on us. I must say being outside in the rain on LSD was one of the greatest experiences I have ever had. I have never had so many visual and audio hallucinations in my life. I could feel the bass of the non-existent music. I could touch and smell the non-existent flowers growing out of cement. The only downside at this point was that me and my friend were completely, and utterly retarded.We ended up going back inside and listened to some music, put on the blacklight and he gave me a light show. The lights were so bright and loud, yes LOUD. I could taste the blues and greens and when the turned the light and music off... everything was dead silent. After a few hours we ended going back to his distributers house where he had just got a new shipment of Ketamine.I was probably 6 hours into this LSD trip from outer space and still I did not level off. My energy and mentral frustration kept building up. When we arrived at his house I grabbed the bottle of liquid Hydrocodone I had and took 2 tablespoons (30mg Hydrocodone, can't recall the amount of acetaminophan). About 10 minutes later I could feel the hydrocodone kicking in.... at which point I noticed I could not even walk.One of the guys at the house just cooked up a vial of Anesket. It was high powered ketamine that was used to tranquilize Horses and even Rhino's (as labeled on the bottle). He came by with a blaster-vial and measured out about 20mg of ketamine and told me to snort it. Immediatly after I snorted it my head hit the table and I passed out.-----------------------------------------------------------------Everything from this point on is what I was told by my friend which most likely saved my life during this whole ordeal. He did not consume anything else at the distributers house besides water as he was frying pretty hard from the LSD.-----------------------------------------------------------------After I passed out I woke up and threw up all over myself, He said that I could not walk or stop vomiting. It was obvious that I had overdosed and was in a tranquilized state of nauseousness. I was heaving so much that I passed out several times more because. I myself can remember some of this, but my concious state of mind had no control. My mind literally recoiled in horror and watched itself as my body began to shut itself down. This was horrifying because I could think but not do anything while my subconcious took over in a fight for survival.I passed out on the linolium floor which I had threw up all over and once my friend realized that I was utterly fucked... he decided to get me out of this drug-distributors house as it was not a safe place to be. He carried me back to his car where I would be nodding in and out of conciousness in an endless state of nausea and vomitting. He drove us both back to his house where I spent the rest of the night on his floor with him force-feeding me water so I wouldn't get too dehydrated from all the vomitting. He talked to me all night and I gradually started to snap out of the ketamine. I started to come to at around 9 am.-----------------------------------------------------------------My previous encounters with ketamine have never lasted that long or tranquilized me that badly. It is obvious that the mixture of the Hydrocodone and LSD made it VERY intense. I to this day cannot thank my friend enough for taking care of me during this. I will not mix LSD and Ketamine together again, as they strongly reacted with each other and overdose in my situation was present. Me and my friend were still feeling the effects of the LSD probably up until the next week.Exp Year: 2006ExpID: 52002Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 26, 2009Views: 20,108    LSD (2), Ketamine (31) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Health Problems (27), Overdose (29), Hangover / Days After (46), Various (28) DOSE:1 lineinsufflatedKetamine(powder / crystals) 7.5 hitsoralLSD(liquid) 3 hitssmokedCannabis(plant material) 1 lineinsufflatedKetamine(powder / crystals)BODY WEIGHT:76 kgBasically here is some background info about myself. I am nineteen years old from England, I have taken acid quite a few times in the last three months and seem to have a natural tolerance to it. Maybe I just take too much I don't know. But I love how cid makes everything appear visually because I am a graphic design student and am naturally a very visual person anyway. I also love how it affects my mind set and makes me think deeply about certain aspects of life and the universe. I am also naturally a very deep thinker and my brain is quite over active.Anyway for the third year running I was going to global gathering which is a big dance music festival. I was planning to take my cid Friday night with some ketamine and take my mdma Saturday night as that was when the drum and bass was playing. I always seem to get carried away when it comes to taking drugs at a festival and I had decided this time was going to be my last for a very very long time as I was going to uni and want to keep a clear mind. Just take acid very rarely maybe once every two months. Bearing in mind I first took cid three months before this experience and since then I have taken around forty drops, I normally get liquid acid and my dealer has very nice cid.Anyway I had 15 drops of this cid on bits of paper that I had bought the night before, I always watch the guy put the drops on, he's very reliable. These drops were half mine and half my friend, so 7.5 each. We get to the festival and get the drugs past the security and the police and their dogs. This festival has the highest security of any festival I know of. We get in and pitch our tents. It was quite a nice sunny day and I was feeling very happy, why shouldn't I feel happy as I was at the best festival in my personal opinion.I sat in my tent which was in a circle of four of us. I decided to get out the ketamine. I had a very covert method of getting the drugs in that I use every year, I wrap them in A LOT of cling film and then place them into crisp packets and then melt them back together. That way when my bag gets searched they don't suspect anything and also the police sniffer dogs can't smell it. So I got the ketamine out and did an average line, feeling in a good mood.I decided then after a few minutes to get my cid out. I sat there in the tent looking at it thinking to myself, ''You shouldn't take all seven and a half drops in one go.'' Before this experience the most I had ever taken was six, but this was at a festival so would maybe be more intense. I thought for maybe a few more seconds and then decided to eat them all. My friend who owned the other seven and a half drops came into my tent with his mouth open wide questioning what I was doing. He didn't agree too much with what I had just done. We are both two people who seem to get carried away and as he saw me do this he soon decided to do the same. So he munched down his cid also. I sat there just outside of my tent with three of my friends. Only two of us took cid, the other two were drinking and taking ketamine. Someone decided to roll a joint as we were sat there. It had been around ten minutes since I had taken the cid and I had started to contemplate what I had just done. It started to occur to me that I had taken seven and a half drops of cid at this festival. I started to have feelings in my body that are related to cid. Tingles and feeling slightly lethargic. I knew that I was going to be in for quite a journey.I looked across at my friend who had also taken the cid as his tent was opposite mine. I laughed in a giggling sort of way at him and said, ''Guy what have we just done??!!'' He laughed back and replied, ''We are going to be wrecked Tom.'' The joint had been rolled and it came to me. I had maybe three tokes and decided I didn't want any as quite often on cid I find smoking is rather harsh on the throat. It had been now half an hour and we hadn't explored around the campsite or the stalls etc. The main part of the festival where all the different dance arenas were didn't open for another two hours so we decided to have a look around. I stood up and as I did my head started to have a sort of rushy feeling within it. My body still feeling the same way. We all left our tents and set off down the path.I noticed that I was starting to trip slightly. I looked at the floor which was a gravel path and the stoned started to morph slightly and have great detail to them. the ketamine I had took just before taking the cid made my vision kind of hazy, I couldn't see things in the distance or mildly close too well. Everything was sort of out of focus. I didn't like this too much and thought I should have taken the ketamine after I had come up from the cid. There was quite a lot of people walking around the campsite, setting up tents etc. Now I had also began to feel a nauseous feeling in my stomach that I sometimes receive after taking cid, especially liquid. I despise this feeling, it is one thing that I dislike about the whole cid experience.After only ten minutes we decided to go back to the tents for a while as me and Guy were feeling quite intense. I wasn't tripping much yet but the feelings I was having were insane. I had never felt anything as strong as this after taking cid. I sat in my tent looking out and listening to the sounds of the festival. I was listening to every individual sound and thought where it was coming from. I was very restless and I could see that also Guy was. Everything was getting too intense for me there and then. I stood up fast and said to Guy, ''I need to get out of this festival pretty quick. I need to go.'' He looked at me and agreed this was a good idea. I needed to centre myself and get away from the intensity of the festival. The other two friends were confused but said ok and they would wait. They were very K'd up as we say, under the influence of a lot of ketamine. I can just realize when someone is on ketamine because they give me this blank look that seems as if they are looking straight through me. Max, one of my friends, had a polo nose as we say, where he had a white ring around his nostril.Anyway me and guy left them and walked to the entrance/exit of the campsite. This festival is on a huge old airfield and runway. So as you get out there are these railings where you get checked and police are there. After this there is a part of the airfield where all the cars are parked. We decided to walk that way, just an immediate reaction to get away directly from the chaos. Across the field there is a road where the cars drive along which is full of police, I mean LOTS. Me and guy just crashed on this field and led there.Now I was tripping pretty hard, the grass was morphing in such a fashion that it appeared like waves in the ocean. Everything had a cartoon feel to it, bold in colour, bright and outlined. I couldn't enjoy this too much as my stomach was feeling so bad. I knew the inevitable was going to happen, I was going to be sick. It has happened to me once before when I took 6 drops of liquid cid. So I was sat there in the sun with Guy, police all around at check points and patrolling maybe one hundred yards away. We were laughing hard from the come up of the cid and then I just vomited everywhere, laughing in between being sick. This whole situation was quite funny to me, the fact I was being sick, laughing and there was so much police everywhere. As I was sick I was tripping more and more. Guy began to be sick also. This image will never leave me. I rolled over onto my back and gazed up into the sky. The few clouds in the sky looked so detailed and were moving around each other. Then a barrage of flies were above my head and were annoying me a lot. so we decided to go back to the campsite now we had relaxed a bit and had a better state of mind. As we walked up to the entrance and the sniffer dogs I remember stumbling a lot bouncing off Guy. We must have looked so obvious to everyone but not one person or police officer said a word. As we got closer to the campsite the sounds of a festival hit me again, this time they did not affect my state of mine so I was happier now. I felt though as if I had been beaten up or hadn't slept in a longtime, although I had enough sleep the night before. This started to play on my mind a little. We got back to the tents and I placed on these sun glasses that gave everything and orange tint. This amazed me and was pretty cool to view everything for a while.I was again sat in my tent looking out at my three friends. I noticed I had lost a lot of my brain power. By this I mean I couldn't think very well, I couldn't do much of anything. I felt as if I lost half of my IQ. I was also getting more and more tired. I felt as if I could pass out and go to sleep which was now worrying me. It was only 2pm. I fought to stay awake and wondered what was going on. I kept getting distracted from every thought by looking at the texture and detail on my tent, looking at the sky things like this.I have once heard about loosing your ego on cid, becoming someone you are not, so I thought maybe this was happening to me. I had taken a lot of cid this time. As I had these glasses on no one could see where I was looking. So I sat there listening and watching my two friends on ketamine. I was thinking how stupid they sounded and how they were being quite foolish. This amused me. I saw Guy who also looked brain dead led on his back. I laughed and said to him that I had wrecked my brain this time. I also noticed my motor skills had been reduced to basically nothing. I tried engaging in the conversation to bring my state of mind back to sanity and regain control of everything. It was working after a while so I was feeling better. I would laugh at things with a very cheeky giggle. I looked at my ketamine and decided to do a small line. It was very very small as I was on a lot of cid. I racked it up onto a bank card and snorted it. This was where things began to get very weird.I went into my tent to put on a change of clothing as we were going out into the festival soon. I closed my tent up and got distracted by how my skin looked so weird. How it was morphing around and appeared to be raising from my body and back down onto it. I then sat up right in shock at what I heard. I had never before really had sound hallucinations but I have heard about them from certain people. There were many people here from all over England with different accents. But I noticed that everything was being echoed and distorted to my ears. Each individual voice was being echoed and bent into a weird sound. This freaked me out to the point I un-zipped my tent and fell out with just my underwear on. I had shock on my face and looked at Guy. I said to him that this was too weird and he laughed at me. I quickly got back in and put my clothes on.When I came out it got worse. It seemed everyone was speaking a different language to me, even the music was echoed and distorted. It all merged into this language I could not understand. Then I remembered something a friend once told me. He said that his uncle once took a lot of cid at a festival and these people fed him quite a bit of ketamine. He went insane and heard everyone in an unknown language. He had to be taken to France for a few months to sort his sanity out. This thought scared the hell out of me.I jumped up and had to get away from all these people and sounds. Guy followed me and also the other two friends. I said that I was again going out of the whole festival but hey insisted on following. As I walked to the entrance/exit I was walking at a fast furious pace with my hands on my head. Only Guy decided to follow me in the end. I got outside of it again and Guy was questioning what I was doing, what was wrong with me. It sometimes was so bad I couldn't understand anyone, but sometimes it was just weird and understandable. I paced again across the field and I remember that these distorted sounds now sounded as if I was stood in a room and they were bouncing off the walls, although I was stood out in a field.I said to Guy that it was crazy, that this had never happened before. I turned around to face the festival from a far. It's hard to explain this part but these distorted sounds, I could actually see them coming from the direction they were being echoed, it was quite weird. they were being woven and entwined around each other. I turned again and paced off insanely. the police hadn't even questioned anything me and Guy had done, we were just randomly waking around this field where no one was around. We sat down and as soon as we did Guy jumped up and shouted. He had been stung by a bee which wasn't good for me as I am allergic to bee stings. So we had to leave that place again. We walked in a different direction, I was thinking and thinking if this would be permanent, these sound hallucinations. If they would ever go away. They were very weird and I couldn't handle them. I noticed how everything looked amazing though, how it looked so clean, so vibrant and cartoon like. This was very good cid and I had done too much. We walked to where you drive into the airfield when you arrive there. There were again so much police. We were going to leave the festival all together but decided we would have to climb over a barb wire fence and there were police all over, so it would look a bit weird to them. Then we realized we had no drink. It was a very hot day so if we were going to leave the whole festival for a few hours we needed a drink. We turned back to go and get one. I saw this teenage boy who was waking away from the entrance very fast and noticed a lot of security coming after him. They had ATVs and some were running. They surrounded him and searched him. Then I heard in the distorted way, ''knifeee knifeee'' as it echoed and bent around time. This specific moment in time in England there was a lot of knife crime and murders so I guess they needed to have tight security. Anyway I then had a paranoia enter my mind that was quite irrational due to the cid. I thought that it would be so easy for terrorists to infect themselves with a deadly, contagious disease such as small pox or something, to attend this festival and spread it around. This thought stayed with me and I focused on it so much. This cid really screwed with my mind. After we had got a drink I led on that field again not daring to go back in. Guy was still with me. he seemed to be fine, tripping nicely. But he didn't take any ketamine yet. I was thinking hard about everything and I decided it was best to go home from everything. As we sat there again a police officer with a sniffer dog was walking towards us. Finally someone had realized how random and weird we were being. He casually took his dog close to us and past us. The dog didn't smell any drugs on us although I remembered I had mdma and ketamine on me at this point. After he went I threw my 2 grams of ketamine away and my gram of mdma. That is how much I wanted to go and not to take any more drugs.I had to ring my mum and tell her what I had done. I am pretty upfront and blunt with my mum when it comes to drugs. She sounded so happy to hear me and was about to go out for a mea with friends. This made it so hard to tell her because I knew I would wreck her day. I told her and she wasn't happy to say the least. She couldn't come and pick me up so we had to contact Guy’s dad who had brought us there in the first place. It is a two hour drive there and a 2 hour drive back. He had done this once already today and I felt so guilty of making him do it again. But I had to go, I couldn't take these noises and thoughts much longer. He said he would come but he would be three hours until he was here as he was visiting Guy’s mum who was at the hospital getting treatment as she had cancer. I felt even worse about this, the amount of shame and guilt I had was too much. I went back to the campsite to unpitch my tent and get my things. My three friends were there and quite sad for me to go, but I had to do it. They were trying to convince me to stay but it wasn't ever going to happen. When I got into Guys dad’s car I was still tripping and I was explaining to him what had happened. I could understand him but everything was still echoed and distorted. We didn't speak much in the car but I mentioned how sorry I was and how much of an inconvenience it was. On the drive back I saw one of the most beautiful sunsets I had ever seen, this warmed my heart a little and I admired it for quite a long time. The sound hallucinations that I hated so much much stayed with me for the next day also, but the were not as bad. I think it was the ketamine that set them off but I cannot be sure. If I ever do cid again I am not using ketamine with it in that dose.Exp Year: 2008ExpID: 72817Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 26, 2009Views: 15,771    LSD (2), Ketamine (31) : Combinations (3), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Festival / Lg.

We had all been pretty close before this, and I was excited for another mind-altering night on LSD. I had tripped twice before that and had an amazing and life-changing time. Acid had consumed me, mentally and spiritually. It was all I thought about and all I wanted to talk about. I believed acid was god's gift to humans; the substance that could save the human race. I never imagined it could ever have a dark side.I was arrogant about my tolerance, and dropped two hoffmans and an MDMA without thinking. Within an hour I was getting the usual visuals and feelings, but a nervous tingling that I contributed to the strange area we were in was starting. The trip started out all right. I realised that 'the substance is all around us.' That is, that every single tree, plant, piece of grass and earth is acid. Acid is wonderful, acid is a vibrant pulsating call to consciousness.More and more however I was becoming segregated from the group. I am usually quite a solitary person, and drugs cause me to go on solitary wanderings without much thought for my own safety. It was all of a sudden finding myself in the dark, in the middle of a dirt road with only grass and trees all around me that I not only became extremely nervous, but felt a full fledged panic attack overwhelm me. I know now that the crowd was not far away, but my mind had already run away with me, and I believed I was lost and alone. I could feel myself hyperventilating and choking on tears. All of a sudden my brother's friend, who we will call Wyvern, and his dealer, who (unfortunately for me) was commonly known as Hell Boy came across me.You would think seeing them would have made me relieved, but instead I felt the most extreme vulnerability and fear overtake me. I was sure that these two men were not here to save me, but instead do unspeakable things to me. In my mind I was now a victim who was about to be raped, and I had to play their mind games or else they would have their way. They, of course, had no idea what I was thinking and casually plonked down on the grass and started chatting. They spoke to me, of course, and I spoke back as a way of 'calming them down out of their ideas to rape me.'What happened next was one of those unfortunate things that escalate bad trips. Wyvern and Hell Boy were both on MDMA and decided to kneed and massage each other's backs. I was sitting beside them watching them do it, with wide eyes, and they must have thought I was keen for a massage too, since they knew I was on MDMA. 'Turn around and I’ll massage you,' said Wyvern. He might as well have said 'Turn around so I can sodomize you.' in my head that is what he said. I turned around, in my head I thought they would turn violent if I didn't. He laid his hands on my shoulders, and all of a sudden I jumped up and started running. In my head he had raped me, even if he had only touched me for a second.I soon came across my brother and the rest of the party again. Apparently I was as white as a sheet, breathing heavily, it truly looked as if I had been attacked. My brother was obviously concerned and they immediately questioned me. I burst into tears and told them that Wyvern and Hell Boy had raped me. Well, when something like this happens you can imagine the effects. We were all on acid, and all of a sudden somebody says they've been raped.I do not wish to go into the details of the next ordeal. It involved trying to determine whether what I said had happened or if it was just the acid. The thing is, in my mind I thought it had happened, and every time some one said 'but maybe you just imagined it' I felt like they were in a conspiracy to silence me as a rape victim or make me think I had imagined things so that they could rape me again. After a grueling and emotionally disturbing time that still leaves me shaking to this day I was finally convinced that it was just the acid and I had not in fact, been raped.After that I spent my trip shuddering, panic-stricken and still trying to extricate my thoughts from reality. We all came down a few hours later, and in the sobering light of day we knew things had changed between all of us. My relationship between my brother and I has all but fragmented, and I still can't look Wyvern in the eye. I have not taken acid since and doubt I ever will. I was raped mentally and spiritually, and for 7 hours relived what a rape victim would feel, but worse, since I believed everyone was in a conspiracy to shut me up.Truth is, there is nothing on this earth or in the universe better than a good acid trip, but at the same time there is nothing on this earth or the darkest reaches of hell that is as terrifying and disturbing as a bad trip. I was never one of those girls who constantly worries about being raped. Sure, I feared it, but it wasn't something that consumed me. The mind is a very dark and complex thing, and LSD opened up chasms and thoughts I never even knew I had.Exp Year: 2007ExpID: 69171Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 8, 2010Views: 36,864    LSD (2), MDMA (3) : Bad Trips (6), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Sex Discussion (14), Relationships (44), Large Group (10+) (19) DOSE: T+ 0:002 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:301 bowlsmokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:200 lbI had been doing psychedelics for about a year before this.  My first trip, on LSD, changed my life.  I went from a lazy but intelligent bum who didn't care too much about school to an incredibly motivated student overnight.  That being my first trip, and it having such a profoundly positive effect on me, LSD has been my favorite drug ever since.  I've tried a few other psychedelics - shrooms, 2-CE, and salvia - but they've only ever just been fun and didn't really have any profound effect on my life.  Subsequent acid trips weren't as life-altering, but I had never had a bad trip.  I had never tripped incredibly hard, either.  That would change this day.My friends and I had just acquired some blotter paper that was supposed to be extremely potent.  I've had very weak acid before (my first trip was on 7 hits of some pathetically weak stuff), and thought I had very strong acid, but I was wrong.  My friends and I all decided to take two hits.  One of my friends had tried it earlier in the week and said that we were in for a crazy ride.15 minutes after dropping, I started to feel the effects.  That's much quicker than acid usually works for me - I'm usually the slow one that doesn't experience anything for an hour and half.  My friend offers me some weed.  I'm not a huge fan of weed, but it has always enhanced my trips in the past, so I figure why not.  I should mention that weed affects me differently than most people - just getting moderately high makes me start tripping while on no other drugs, and smoking while tripping usually more than doubles the intensity of the trip.After smoking, all the patterns around the house start becoming much more intense and apparent.  I had only dropped like 30 minutes earlier, and this was usually something I didn't start seeing until a good two hours after dropping.  I go into my friend's room and we chill for a good 10-15 minutes.  My friend owns a sitar, and every single note I played on it sent an orgasmic feeling running up and down my spine.  I notice that the room is starting to look like a forest.  That was sort of weird - I had never tripped so hard that the room transformed.  Eventually, the entire room was a forest, with my friends sitting on what looked like tree stumps, and the sitar looked like a bamboo tree.  I could still play it like an instrument, but this was starting to creep me out.Next, a movie was put into the TV.  I can't recall the name of it, but it's a rotoscope film about a post-apocalyptic future where everyone is hooked on drugs.  I hadn't seen it before, but the intro was very unsettling.  Some guy wakes up covered in insects, and he is jittery and afraid.  I start to have irrational thoughts - what if I'M covered in insects?!  My heart starts racing faster and faster.  I can hear it pounding in my chest.  I pull out my phone and see that it hasn't even been an hour since I dropped.  Realizing that this is the start of a bad trip, I decide to try and do something about it.  I start thinking that I should call the hospital.  I open up my phone and start to dial 911, but luckily I stop myself and decide to see if I can calm myself down by heading to my room.I leave the room and walk down the hallway.  Another one of my sober friends grabs me and brings me into his room.  He shows me a picture of some sort of angel shaped cloud on his computer, and I think that the angel is coming out of the screen and I just run out of the room wordlessly, doubtlessly confusing him (he didn't know that I was tripping).  I continued down the hallway, and it felt like the entire hallway was collapsing on me.  The ceiling, floor, and walls were all curved inwards.  As I walked down the hallway, parts of my vision began to look like fireflies, popping in and out of existence.  I thought that this was pretty cool, but my heart was still pounding in my chest.  That was the only sound I heard.I get to my room and spend a minute or two pacing back and forth.  I still had some of my wits about me, so I tried to calm myself down by just thinking.  That wasn't working, so I left my room and visited a very experienced psychonaut friend of mine down the hallway, who was sober.  I asked him what to do if I was having a bad trip.  He had never had a bad trip, but he told me to just try to calm down and remember all the fun trips I had had.  I told him that I wanted to go to the hospital, and he said that that wouldn't do anything.  They would just strap me down and I'd have to wait there until the trip was over, which would doubtlessly be even more miserable.  For some reason, the fact that the hospital couldn't help me calmed me down a tiny bit.  I was on my own - I had to calm myself down.I was sitting down on his couch, but the entire world was wavering and shifting - sort of like going back and forth over an entire image with the blur tool in photoshop.  The only colors I saw were dismal greys and blues.  I thought the couch was going to lift up off the ground.  My heart was still pounding, but I was still managing to keep my wits about me.  Part of me was telling myself that there was nothing to be worried about - I was just sitting on a couch, and nothing was happening around me.  My subconscious was panicking for no reason.  I nervously glance at my phone over and over.  Minutes seemed like days.Another psychedelic-experienced but sober friend of mine comes into the room.  He has had a bad trip before, and starts relating to me very well.  This isn't helping very much, but I notice that my mind is starting to drift away from reality.  I felt like I was going to pass out from the unbelievably intense anxiety I was feeling, and this was very soothing to me.  I definitely wanted to pass out.  As I feel like I'm drifting out of consciousness, I start tripping far beyond what I knew tripping could be like.  Rivers of beautiful color started rushing past my head, strange green tentacles with eyeballs began growing out of the floor, and the world itself was dissolving.The next thing I remember is floating on my back in a warm yellow colored river.  It is calm and serene, and I have no idea who I am or where I am.  That was OK, though.  I am floating towards an amazing mansion made out of red light.  The sky is made out of shimmering green and blue jewels.  Instead of grass, the ground is just a translucent green color.  My worries and anxieties were completely gone.Next, my dream world shifts.  All I see is a very expensive looking leatherbound book, floating in a sea of color.  The book opens, and the golden pages fill with words.  I can read the words, but I do not know their meaning.  Very slowly, meaning comes back into the world.  I start to understand the words.  I feel like I'm very young again, learning to read for the first time.  I realize that I'm reading my own biography.  I then realize that I've completely forgotten who I am.  The panic starts again.  I fear that I've completely lost my mind.  I don't remember taking a drug - I don't even remember what a drug is.  I start feeling as though I've gone completely insane.This panic attack isn't nearly as strong as the earlier one.  Instead, I feel a mad scramble to memorize what is written in my biography so that I can remember who I was.  In the book is my name, my major, where I go to school, the names of some of my friends...  They all look completely foreign to me.  Moreover, my biography is telling me that I took something called 'LSD', a drug that makes the world seem crazy.  I have no idea what LSD is, or what drugs are.  My entire universe still consists of this book floating in a sea of color.After a few minutes of this, reality starts leaking back into my head.  I realize that the book I was holding is actually a piece of paper my friend gave me, because I had been sitting on the couch asking who I was.  He tells me to just keep reading the paper over and over, and I'll start to remember all of it.  He calms my mind by describing to me exactly how I feel - that I've gone insane and forgotten that I've taken a drug.  He tells me that the same thing has happened to him before, and he is still here.  He tells me that I had just been sitting on the couch for the past half hour, and I'm just fine.I still feel like I need to memorize the facts on the paper, since I don't remember who anyone is or what anything is.  I do need to pee really bad, though.  I carry my piece of paper with me to the bathroom so that I don't forget who I am.  After peeing, I come back to the room and notice that the paper is gone.  This is very frightening to me, since I see losing the paper as a metaphor for losing myself.  My friend quickly runs and brings it back to me.  This soothes me.After some talking, I am pulled out of the pit of despair and begin having an amazing trip.  I start to remember who I am, and everything seems new again.  I feel like I have been reborn.  My entire psyche was pulled apart and then rebuilt, and I have survived.  The world seems fresh and interesting.  The rest of the day was spent in absolute euphoria, as I gleefully enjoyed every sensation as though it was brand new again.Overall, the trip was definitely a positive experience.  Being pulled out of absolute misery by my friends made me appreciate friendship on a whole new level.  Even bad trips can be an opportunity for growth.  That being said, my next trip was pretty much a train wreck.  It wasn't a bad trip in the normal sense, it was just an entire day of feeling very physically unpleasant followed by a week of snappiness.  It's taken a couple of months for my mind to return to almost-normal, and I've been avoiding psychedelics in the interim until I feel completely ready to head back down the rabbit hole.Exp Year: 2008ExpID: 78253Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Mar 23, 2010Views: 17,904    LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Relationships (44), Therapeutic Intent or Outcome (49), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)   smokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:125 lbOkay, so I guess you could say that I used to be quite the psychonaut.  I was no stranger to doing drugs.  At the time, I had already done acid probably about a hundred times, and I had eaten up to ten hits before and been just fine.  I think that just goes to show how our minds react to psychedelics in different ways, without our control.  I will say that I think that I learned a lot from acid, but I will also say that I also screwed my mind and soul up for the rest of my life.  Ever since this horrible night, I have not been the same.  It is something that I still think about and try to figure out to this day, even though there is nothing to figure out.So anyway, it started out like many other Fridays for me, I went to school and by the end of the day, I had scored 2 hits acid from this chick that I knew usually had quality products.  She called it white fluff, but to me, it just looked like the regular old white blotter that was so popular in s. fla. in the mid-90's.  So after school, I went home, dropped off my backpack and proceeded to the bus stop where I would ride the city bus to my friends house about 30 miles away like I did every weekend.  While I was on the bus, I decided to drop the acid.  It was about a half-hour ride to the mall, where I had to transfer to another bus.  It was while sitting at the mall, waiting for the bus that I noticed it taking effect.  I was looking out into the parking lot and I saw some cars begin to stretch and bend.  Ahhh, now that's what I was waiting for.So the bus arrived and I hopped on, still feeling pretty mellow.  For the next 20 minutes or so, it was rather mild, I could hear everyone on the bus talking, and I would hear everything they were saying.  It was not until I got to my destination bus stop that it really hit me.  As I stepped off the bus, as soon as I walked out into the late afternoon sun, it was like walking into another world.  Colors were radiating from everything.  Cars driving by had trails that seemed to go on forever.  Now I knew I was finally tripping.  As I was walking to my friend V's house, my mind was racing, going from one thing to another, all kinds of crazy thoughts manifesting themselves, which I knew was normal, I had been there before.  Then all of a sudden, I found myself saying, 'No, I’m not going to go on a bad trip tonight.'  I had never had a thought like this while tripping, and it kind of alarmed me, but I tried to put it away and think of something else.I got to V's house and no one was home.  I decided to wait, because I knew they would be home soon.  I sat in a lounge chair on the side of his house and watched the colors swirl and bend and spiral into infinity.  I felt strange, quite different, like something big was about to happen, and I didn't know why.He finally got home and he had just come from the dentist and was all fucked up on vicodin, talking slowly, and to me, in my acid drenched mind, he was slurring his speach and I couldn't understand what the hell he was saying.  We went inside began watching tv.  The show that was on that night was called Strange Luck, and this particular episode was about this little black cube that everyone wanted, but when they got it, all kinds of bad things would happen to them.  Needless to say, this was not the right show to watch.I asked V to smoke a bowl with me, thinking it would calm me down.  Boy was I wrong.  With every toke I took, the world got more and more unnoticable.  I had to get up to get something to drink, and on my way to the fridge, I thought I noticed that every move I was making, every step I took, was exactly what was happening on the tv.  I began to think that v was fucking with me.  I knew he was really good with computers and I began thinking he was some sort of computer wizard and he had me in some sort of virtual reality computer game.  This is when it all started going WAY downhill.V could see I was getting a little edgy, so he asked if I wanted to go to Bo's house down the street (Bo was an older guy in his late 20's at the time and he was our mentor in these areas).  I said yes, because I knew he would know how to make it all better.  We walked outside and into the street, as soon as we began walking in the direction of bo's house, this huge pickup truck drove by us and for some reason, it really freaked me out.  I looked down at the ground and I could see the ground moving by under my feet, but when I looked up, I was not moving, I felt I was going nowhere.  At this point I could tell that I could not distinguish reality.  I looked a V and grabbed hold of him to make sure he was real, I told him to just take me back to V's house over and over again (I thought he was a cop and he was leading me into a trap).  I guess I kind of scared him and he though I was going to hit him, so he turned and took off.  So here I am, in the middle of the street, out of my mind, and my best friend/cop/narc just went running back to his house.  At this point I have no idea where I am, nothing looks familiar, and begin to think I’m dreaming, some sort of nightmare.  So I ran over to the side of some stranger’s house and laid down in the grass, thinking that if I went to sleep, I would wake up in my bed, and it would all be over.Boy was I wrong.  As I was laying in the grass, I could actually feel hands coming up from the ground trying to pull me down.  I thought that these were demons and they were trying to pull me into hell.  I could hear this strange music, sounded like out of tune violin strings mixed with fingernails running down a chalkboard.  I got up and went and sat down on the curb in front of these people's house.  I thought I had finally lost my mind.  I could see myself locked up in the looney bin, with a straight jacket and all.  It was at this time that the people whose house I was sitting in front of came home.  They drove up and I immediatly walked up to their car and asked them to roll their windows down.  I could see the look in their faces and they were terrified.  Understandable I suppose.  I told them I had taken too much acid and I needed to go to the hospital.  I asked them to call 911 and my mom.So I’m standing outside their house as they go inside, completly flipping out.  I gave them my phone # and they called my mom.  I heard them say that I could come inside and talk to my mom.  I got on the phone and was screaming to my mom 'Mom, I have no idea what’s going on!!  I can't tell what’s real and what’s not!!'  She asked me if one of the girls were there (one of the girls that had called her) and I took this to mean that I was in a whore house and my mother knew these people and she was a prostitute.  I dropped the phone and just began screaming and crying because I had no idea what was going on.  I thought my mom was a prostitute, that I had been abducted by aliens and this was some kind terrible mind experiment, and somehow I was set up to all this.  Just then I notice lights flashing outside and I hear a voice on a megaphone saying come outside now.  I replied that I didn't know where the door was, and I didn't.  The voice said to follow the voice.  So I did and it lead me outside.  As soon as I walked out the door, there were what looked like 20 cops standing there, all with their guns pointed at me screaming 'GET ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW!!!!'  I was happy to reply and I dropped to the ground.  They cuffed me and threw me into an ambulance.As soon as I was thrown into the ambulance I began to feel like everything was going to be ok.  I was still on a trip, and I was scared as shit, but I knew that I was going somewhere safe.  In the ambulance, a cop was in there asking me all kinds of questions which I didn't understand.  I could hear him, understood the words he was saying, but I had no idea what he was saying.  Very strange.  All I could see was his head floating around the ambulance in a white fuzz.  For most of the trip to the hospital, I just laid there staring at everyone who tried to talk to me.  I didn't say a word and I couldn’t understand why so many people were inside the ambulance, even tho all I could see was one face at a time, floating around in space.I arrived at the hospital and they must have shot me up with something because I all of a sudden felt like I was floating on a cloud and I was very calm.  My mom made everything better, even tho I still thought she was a prostitute and she looked like a zombie, my mom made me realize that everything was going to be okay.  I stayed at the hospital I guess until my pupils stop dilating because they were shining that damn light in my face every 2 minutes it seemed like.  On the ride home, as I was finally coming to, I asked my mom if any of it was real.  I was somewhat back to normal now, but everything I went through still seemed so real.I was not right for some months afterward.  It took me years to get to the point where I didn't think about it every day.  I still to this day, wonder if there really was something deeper to what happened to me that night.  I still wonder if I was part of some sort of experiment, simply because it was so real, and I still remember everything clearly, as if it happened yesterday.I do know, however, that this is the nature of psychedelics.  We start the journey in search of some sort of deeper knowledge, to open our minds, or to have a spiritual experience, only to find ourselves opening pandora's box, and unleashing our worst nightmares into reality.  I did acid a couple times afterward, but every time, I had to fight to stay sane.  It was a struggle just to keep myself from going over the edge.  I finally decided that it was not worth the mental pain anymore and stopped.  I haven't done acid in 9 years now, and although I still find myself wanting to catch a glimpse of the beauty that I once knew, I am always reminded of the horrible nightmare of that fateful night.Exp Year: 1995ExpID: 64518Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Mar 30, 2010Views: 47,932    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Post Trip Problems (8), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Various (28) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab) 1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:8 kgFor some time now I have wanted to go the whole way and try LSD. I have done weed, which in my experience only induced paranoia and mild anxiety, I have also done Magic Mushrooms, which now thinking back on, wasn't the best experience and was dreadful to consume. But the time finally fell upon me that I was to take LSD. Forgetting completely about how it could go terribly wrong I took my first tab four days ago at Reading Festival. There were several of us taking the tabs so I felt comfortable in what I was doing. I was happy and felt confident.Now from here until I started feeling the full effects there was a long time gap, and I lost all sense of time. We found ourselves trooping towards the main arena to go watch Red Hot Chili Peppers live, although by the time we got there one of my fellow trippers had fell ill and couldn’t move an inch. We thought the best thing to do was to go get help and get her to the Medical Tent. Even though this was such a serious task, making sure she was okay, me and a friend just couldn’t help grinning and giggling at nothing at all.Everyone in the Medical Tent was friendly and understood our confused ramblings, one of the medics even asked us whether we had seen any “green tornados” of some sort yet, of course our reply was to roar with laughter as everything he came out with was confusing. We told him that we took a tab of acid that had a picture of a Divinci Code man on it, after much Charades as we couldn’t remember the right name.Shortly after we met up with everyone else back at the arena and made our way to the funfair that was near. By this time, everything was sparkling and swaying slightly. We all clambered straight onto the Waltzers and handed over our money. As soon as it started we all felt like we were in heaven, it was like complete euphoria. Music swished past my ears, lights and UV soaked white clothes swam in the air, and every time I turned my head to look at my friends all I could see was smiles. I had decided right there and then that this was certainly the best night of my life. Once it had finished my whole body tingled and felt amazing. We sat and watched other riders on the Mega Motion and sat there laughing at their faces. By this time we had met up with one of our friends who was not on Acid and felt like he was our guider and was there to make sure we were all okay. We walked around the shops, gazing at all the clothes and accessories there was to buy. The best way to explain this was that we felt like children, all grouped together, all amazed. Then we found a stall that robbed us blind of our money. All stacked up on a rack was blue and green light sabers that we just had to have. Now so far there were about 10 or so of us walking around like an army of star war lovers waving around those long sticks. By this time I had realised I could make a trail of light, almost like a snail trail in the night sky. Again time ticked away, hours felt like seconds and before I knew it we were back near the main arena waiting for more non-trippers to join us, and to go to the Silent Disco that was available at Reading this year. Some decided to drop Acid as well, it being there first time also. I was trying my best to explain to some of them they may not like it, but couldn’t give a good reason why they wouldn’t. Around this time I also took my second tab, only wanting this good feeling to stay and never leave me. No-one bothered to stop me and only said I’d either lose the tab or have no one else to trip with another day. So I plopped it on my tongue and sucked away.Once people had started to come up, they all wanted light sabers too, so we had to walk back to stall where they had sold them. This is when it all went downhill. The best night of my life turns into a living nightmare. As they all collected their light sabers, me and 2 other friends were standing on the grass near them. My head lolled around taking in all the lights, mist and swaying trees. Then I looked down smiling at the ground when I thought I saw a glowing worm in the grass. I bent a little lower and to my horror the whole grass stretch had morphed into scorpions, their stinger tails swinging and rising up into my face. I stood up immediately and said to the friend “something’s gone wrong”. She of course knew nothing was wrong and smiled at me. I started to panic crazily as her face and hair and body started grow little scorpions from no where and their tails shaking, making the whole surface of her face purple. I’d close my eyes and shake my head then when I’d open my eyes for a split second everything was okay again. Then the scorpions would just re-appear. I was too confused to even believe that this was just my mind, and not real but I couldn’t handle the fact that everything was freaking me out.I looked back at the ground hopefully reversing the curse and that the scorpions would die away and I would be fine again – no chance. Again, the grass began to morph into something worse, one of my actual fears - dead bodies. My feet were rooted to the spot even though I wanted so bad to get up and out of the rising dead that was only grass. Funnily enough I didn’t scream or cry – instead I complained to my fellow trippers what was happening, but they just didn’t seem to give a fuck. I now understand why they didn’t care because it wasn’t their problem, but none of them was prepared to help me. Sound was distorted and music sounded awful. I looked up into the sky and it looked like coloured mosaics in the sky, this made me feel good again but I couldn’t keep looking up at the sky knowing fully well that I was wading through dead bodies.I kept wailing saying I needed to get back to the campsite because I couldn’t take anymore of this, but no one was listening. I was also scared and panicking that my boyfriend wouldn’t of approved of me tripping and even more so that it was a bad trip so I was terrified of going back to camp. This only made things worse.It felt like we were standing around for days doing nothing and I was starting to get terrified of all the people I really liked as friends. The one person who said to me acid wasn’t a good idea was the worst of all. Her face was green and curly hair started to wave around her face like medusa’s hair, her teeth were all chiselled into sharp points when she spoke and her eyes bright green. There was neon coloured hair on her face and when she spoke it sounded so much like she was telling me off and I felt so alone. Even though she was so scary I didn’t back away from her or anyone else because I knew that if I didn’t stay with these guys I would have ended up dead.Other people’s faces were odd and distorted. Some had 4 eyes, some had these weird maze-like descriptions on their cheeks, and others just looked like demons. I don’t know how I made it back to camp because all the oncoming people looked immensely like Death Eaters and Dementors (if you’ve read Harry Potter you’ll know what I mean) and just glided past me, cold air slicing through my face. I forgot who was holding my arm but it must have been someone I had known but their voices kept speeding up and slowing down so much it was inaudible to understand what they were saying.By the time I got into my tent and found my boyfriend it felt like earth had crashed down upon me because once I hit the ground I couldn’t move. I tried to explain how bad the situation was to him, and how important it was for him to stay awake and comfort me, but I kept shaking and muttering about all the things I could see forming shape on my tent floor. It must have been for hours that I was freaking out because after some while, staring at the main area of my tent (it was a big 6 man tent) and my sleeping bag, everything morphed into nothing that was in my tent. Large bodies came floating up from the ground and I couldn’t feel my boyfriend clutching me close. Then all of sudden the worst part of it all, the bodies seemed to sit up, stand up and grow like mountains and I suddenly had to stand up to get away from them but the sensation that took over my body was uncontrollable and I screamed so loud for so long, but couldn’t hear myself. I looked up and felt like I was in a glass orb that was my tent, but repeated many times like when you look through 2 mirrors. One of my friends who had been happily tripping outside came crashing through the tent to try and help me, although I could see about 5 of the same person holding out their hands to me. I could hear this thumping in my ears and this low buzz as I tried to reach out to the hands, but then screamed again when I realised I had lost touch of my boyfriend and where had he disappeared to. I looked around and saw a split second of his face surrounded by dead bodies and dark green muck before I felt him dragging me down on the floor again.After the whole fiasco of me losing the whole plot, I was describing to him that when I closed my eyes I could see lots of little Pacmen flying through oblivion. We both came to the decision that if what I see when my eyes are open is terrifying, I should keep my eyes closed until it all went away. So I had my fingers sealing my eyes shut so I couldn’t see the dead bodies in my tent slithering about. But every so often I would have to open my eyes to see if it had subsided, which of course it didn’t. Whenever I dared myself to open my eyes again, the light filtering through the tent seemed to get lighter and lighter, meaning morning was dawning. I thought to myself surely by morning I’ll be fine. While having my eyes shut it was almost pleasant to see something other than dead bodies, scorpions and medusa haired people – instead I was seeing puzzle shaped nothingness, twirling around in bright colours I’ve always been fond of. For most of the time it was like being in a kaleidoscope.Then the time came for me to open my eyes again. Dazed and very confused I could see familiar clothes scattered around the tent floor and my sleeping bag, and to my relief my boyfriends face swaying about violently as if I was on a boat. However when I looked down at my hands, it looked like I was covered in mud. I bent forwards and my nose felt like it was dripping so I went to wipe it away and looked at my hands once again and my hands were covered in blood. Asking my boyfriend in alarm he assured me it was fine.More hours passed and more people came into my tent, some worse off than before, but none experiencing what I had just been through. I took photos and videos and entertained myself by looking at my friend’s skin and muscles while my boyfriend slept. After a while I went out into the main arena to go find food. I didn’t feel hungry but felt somewhat displaced because I missed so many events that last night because of all the freaky shit I was seeing. I didn’t feel that anxious persistence anymore but on the way back to the tent I looked at the grass and it started again. My heart started racing and I couldn’t even think about calming myself down. The grass started jerking around and I was sure that it was either spiders or crickets. Either or I still started to freak out and stopped dead in my tracks to cover my eyes and wail that I needed my boyfriend.It felt so pathetic that I needed him so bad, but when I got back to the tent I didn’t feel any better. I would sit down in one place, with my friend in a circle around me, and then feel as if I was being dragged away and my friends bodies were going further and further away from me. Of course I panicked again but after a while it subsided. From the time the depths of the horror had finished around 6am, I still felt odd and like the only one who was still tripping for the whole day. At around 5pm on Sunday I started to get that tingling feeling that I had last night on the funfair rides, although this time it didn’t feel good. It felt as if I was locked in some force field and I was unable to break free. It almost felt as if I was a robot. I had gone to see some bands play earlier in the day (solely because I didn’t want to be left alone) but didn’t enjoy the crowds of people staring and being too close to me. I also felt a bit nervous of the vast amounts of grass around me and I was scared that the dead bodies were going to rise up from no where again.Once I got back to camp I felt exhausted and had slight sunstroke. I attempted to sleep in my tent but couldn’t do it. My boyfriend found me a few minutes later and came to hug me and comfort me. It felt so nice and the sweet things he was saying made me feel so good, but I started crying hysterically saying I wanted it all to be over and kept asking my boyfriend to kill me. I kept seeing knives scattered all around the tent, wondering where they came from, but they could aid me in my death. I felt extremely suicidal and felt like ripping my skin apart.Again the hours whipped past and it was gradually getting dark again. I was getting extremely agitated because I hadn’t slept all of Saturday night and it was time to sleep again but I couldn’t sleep as I was too petrified. This odd phone music kept going off near my tent, which sounded like a haunted ice cream van and I kept muttering to my boyfriend “I’m going crazy, I’m going crazy”. My friends outside the tent had started a fire, they had warned me, but in my deluded state of mind I kept thinking the only reason they had the fire going was to kill themselves. I could hear loud and clear them saying things connected to death. I could see the fire flames licking through the tent material and as soon as I saw it felt like I was on fire, drowning in the flames.By this time everyone was concerned by my tears and crazy mutterings and thought it should be best to get me home, seeing as it was Sunday at Reading and everyone went a bit mental and sets everything on fire. My friends got me an ambulance to the Medic Tent where I spent a while trying to calm myself down but still feeling like I was trapped in a force field. Finally my boyfriend and I caught a taxi to the station, got 2 trains home and got straight into bed. I finally drifted off to sleep and woke up no longer feeling anxious or trapped in a force field, but my mind was clogged up with all the bad things that happened that previous night.It’s only been a few days but I still feel dazed and unhappy with everyone for different reasons. Also when I drift off to sleep and wake up I get vicious flashbacks, which I hadn’t realised before that it was, but I thought it hadn’t wore off yet. I don’t know how long these flashbacks are going to last but I can tell you now, I am somewhat unstable, suffer from depression, use drugs to numb reality, and didn’t think twice about me having a bad trip. But now coming to think of it, it was bound to happen to me.Now I’ve made the decision that I will no longer touch ANY sort of hallucinogens, or marijuana. I just wish everyone else who was having the time of their life could have been in my shoes to know I’m feeling now.Exp Year: 2007ExpID: 65429Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: May 8, 2010Views: 7,061    LSD (2) : Hangover / Days After (46), Multi-Day Experience (13), Bad Trips (6), Festival / Lg. Crowd (24) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:56 kgMy trip took me to hell on earth, literally. I saw and knew in my head that in every second someone is dying and that they are going to die the most painful and ugliest looking death and suffer until thereīs no being alive. The whole humankind was about to be destroyed by Death. It was my first trip and i had been waiting for it since i smoke my first weed sometime in junior high and got to know what drugs are about. At first i knew i might not be ready, since i had done some research of how the drug works and heard tons of crazy stories starting from a guy who ate his whole shoe; another one who made himself a nest out of cardboard and old newspapers and stayed there for days; a group who drove into the black hole in the beginning of the trip and remembered nothing after this. But most of people just see fractals, patterns and enchanting beauty in everything and can chill out in the party or in the crowds.I have to say i was mentally a bit fucked, since i was just coming out of depression what had lasted for about two years. Thatīs why i may have experienced what i did. But i still descided to take it because i had a chance, and LSD is not something one could find often in the place iīm from.I think i got depressed because i had doubts in myself about not becoming a 'proper adult, not having a good job and being worried about what to study since my mind changes a lot.  And the second thing was probably that i had had death breathing on my neck for ten years of time. From 10 years of age until 20 i lost my dad through car accident by drunk driver, my biological father drank himself to death, my uncle got killed by electric shock when he went to repair the powerlines at grandmas place. Then a first guy friend i had in school and with whom i was just getting really close to. One day he was found dead next to 16-storey building. No one knows did he jump/was pushed/fell, because he might have been high or just had some trouble with his bosses with some dealing money or stuff.  Plus grandma and grandfather too, but those were by natural deaths. And many pets that kids especially love.-----------------There was three of us taking acid for the first time plus one girl who had tried it once or twice before and agreed to keep an eye on us. We each had a blotter out of Jaggers Lips sheet and then our watcher took us for a ride near to small city where one folk music festival was taking place. So there were hippie-like and hippie minded people around the city.The first weirdness came over us about 30 minutes later when we were still at the car. It felt strange and was pretty strong (but somewhat acquainted because we all had taken shrooms before) and sort of ugly, because I saw faces slowly distorting. We went to some field and sat down on the ground and then the most magical things started to happen. The ultimate synesthesia, where I see sounds and hear colors, where fractals buzz through my mind and sing me the ultimate beauty and happiness through the vocal chords out from this everyday world. We were the colors of the fractals.After the first peak the drug let us calm down for a while, we went to the car and drove back to city to take a walk. Thats where my mind started alternating between two realities, besides the one i was actually in. I donīt remember it thouroughly at what point it happened, but i started noticing bad things around me happening. At one reality i was an old hippie whoīs priorities for my understanding were nicely set. It was all about the goodness and right way of living, very down to earth and nature/people friendly. And the other reality where i was started showing me all the messed up and just bad things. How traffic is not well organized and people get killed by accidents (by drunken drivers for example). How kids hurt themselves with glass shards when they play at the same playground where youngsters drank the night before and broke bottles by throwing them because theyīre in that state where they just donīt care. How fucked it is that nowdays your looks and how much you weigh is so important, for example old hippie had saggier boobs and the other reality needed plastic surgery to keep nice tits. But  you canīt stay young forever and fight the nature, right?!   Anyway, at one point i saw that my friend had jumped from the bridge to the river (he actually went swimming), but the waterlevel was too low and there was a stone where he hit himself when he jumped into the water (there were no be careful or no swimming signs, which showed again how things are not taken care of in public places). He came out all bloody. And accidents around me started to happen and I started feeling all the pain people around me were feeling. Then my friends started walking me back to our car, because i was going pretty crazy. I could not watch children crossing the street and started screaming because of the danger i could see coming; i saw them getting hit by a car. My friends in my realm had a car accident too. The guy was barely walking and had little pieces of glass from car windows in his throat from the hit and he couldnīt breath properly. The girl who was driving us around and taking care of us had had the biggest injuries from the impact in her stomach. Her face was purple, swollen and i saw through her shirt that all her insides were freakily messed up and shirt was the only thing keeping her together.It was like rotten.com and the madest photos about killing and accidents and torturing people, stuff what you accidentaly see in the web for example. Add some of the sickest thrillers and scary movies youīve seen from different eras and countries. And that feeling what you might get if you see a weekend afternoon in the lovely town and everyone you meet dying at any second. Everywhere i looked, there was a hardcore battlefield, but not just something you see in war movie. Add women, kids and messy accidents with extra blood and guts everywhere around.  We even had police coming to talk to us at some point, but my friend just said this is the hippie tripping and that itīs better to let me be, since theres nothing to do with me anyway.I started crying because it naturally makes you cry if you see what i saw, plus the extra knowledge of every single being dying. First people i was with, then my family and friends and everyone else one after another. I cryied hysterically, when that bad reality (BR) filter came on to me. At one point my nose was blocked from that crazy crying and i just could not breath normally. I did not think of blowing my nose, because at that point i was most of the time in bad reality screaming. And when i was back in that old hippie reality i just tried to catch my breath because i knew in any seconds that bloody filter comes over my vision and thoughts and i feel the sickest pain again.I felt like my head and heart were squeezed by the insanity i experienced. I had lumps of blood gurgling in my throat and taste of it in my mouth all the time i was in BR. I could not breath normally, because i cried madly and could not catch my breath all the time plus the snot factor (tons of it dripping out of my nose). Finally shifts between two realities became less frequent as the drug was leaving my system. It took about 4-5 hours since we took acid and it was oh-such-a-relief to get out from it. I slept the whole day after the trip, just got up to eat or wee and i didnīt really spoke a word throught the week after it. I was just so shaken and stirred. It took me few weeks after i could talk about what really happened to friends who were with me, and it still made me shaky and filled my eyes with tears.I still wonder how i can possibly have all this in my head without ever seeing so many ugliness and warped ideas and acts in my life. I guess we just all know everything and are part of everything (infinity) and have the essence of things in us, but are not capable to see all that, because of the simple form most of us are in (outcluded rainman, geniuses and all types of beings called witches, madmen, psychos, religion freaks etc).I did the same Rolling Stone blotter in two parts few months later (alone), because i sort of needed to slowly become friends again with the drug since i needed to face that state i was in. I got some weak flashbacks from the trip and shed some big tears without crying. But i want to take acid again and get more of that power this drug has a to offer. But iīm afraid of something similary sick to happen (iīm a bit of a weirdo anyway) and that what keeps me cautios.Even after almost a year since the trip i find new nuances-answers-ideas from it and see how powerful this thing is on top of our shoulders. It made my paths in time and space more clearer, confirmed that tolerance, empathy and similar things i have thought of as important are extremely valuable. And although it was the ultimate pain possible to go through for me, because it always hurts worst in your heart and soul than in your physical body, i would not exchange the experience. Itīs just that you never know where you might go.Exp Year: 2007ExpID: 72427Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: May 27, 2010Views: 10,955    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Bad Trips (6), First Times (2) DOSE:   Pharms - Lithium(daily) 2 hitsoralLSD(cookie / food)BODY WEIGHT:180 lbMe and my friends had been talking about taking some acid for a couple of months, but had not really pursued it other than just talking. It was a Friday night just like any other; we were probably just going to get drunk, smoke some weed and chill. The day before a friend of mines sister called and said she had got a hold of some really good acid and wanted to know if we where still interested. Of course I was, I had never done it before, but the other 2 of my friends doing it with me (we will call them J and R) had done acid before. So we go to the bank and drive over to the friend’s sister’s house. Get there buy the acid which comes in the form of 3 super cubes which I am told by the sister each contains 2 hits. She also says she took it the night before and it’s really strong so be careful. I have done lots of ecstasy in my day, as well as DXM, shrooms, cocaine and weed, so I am really not concerned at the time to be more careful. We get back to my house, there are 5 of us that live there including J and R, also my girlfriend is there but leaves not long after I take mine, also some other people over to just hang out and smoke some weed. We all take our suger cube, no need for any chaser it’s a sugar cube it tastes great. Its mid summer so one of my roommates decides he wants to go drive around and look for races and then go to the sonic where there is a car meet. Also I am prescribed lithium for my bi-polar disorder. I take 1 pill in the morning (300mg) and 1 at night (300mg). I had not taken my morning pill because I was taking the acid later that night and figured they would not mix well taken so close together. T +00:00 – Take the acid, and leave with roommate and J to go find races and go to car meet at sonic.T+00:40 – Start to feel a little funny, start to see things. Squares of color in my vision, things seem to look plaid.T+00:50 – We get to the car meet at sonic after finding no races. Now I can really feel I'm on something. Looking around everything seems really pixilated in all different colors, and then it comes, a sherbert orange 69 chevy camaro. This car looks so fluffy, like it had shag carpeting as a paint job. I remember saying I was going to get out and touch it (we never left the truck, just drove around the lot looking at cars). Wisely both friends advised against it.T+01:20 – Me and J are tripping pretty hard and decide its time for my roommate to take us back to my place so we can trip there and meet back up with R and see how he is doing. T+01:35 – Driving down the highway listening to hardcore is nice. All of a sudden things start becoming too much and I start to lose my vision, I tell J this and he advises me to put on my sunglasses to help mellow the high. For some reason putting sunglasses on always help mellow me out when things are getting heavy, and this time was no different. T+01:50 – Back at my place, R is tripping balls and just sitting there looking around. I sit on the couch and smoke a cigarette, trying to play off that I'm not freaking out. Maybe this is what an acid trip is like; I don’t know this is my first time.T+02:00 – Things are really getting heavy now, I can barely see anything, all I see is whiteness nothing else, also I cant hear or feel its like a complete sensory shutdown. I now realize that this is not what is supposed to be happening due to J and R are not having the same experience as myself, not even close. I ask a friend to take me to my bedroom so I can lie down. This is when I start to lose track of time and what is happening.T+ ?? – I'm in the bathroom screaming for help, curled up in a ball in the corner of the shower stall (shower is not on), lose consciousness again. T+?? – I don’t really know where I am, I know that I am in a bad way, but I don’t know how badly. I can’t tell if my eyes are open or closed because I only see one color WHITE. My mind is racing at a thousand miles per hour. I have a thought, and then it’s gone, and then a new thought and it’s gone. I try to remember a thought but forget instantly to try to remember it. I scream my girlfriends name but I don’t know if anyone hears it because I can’t see or hear anything. I can feel this weird pressure on my body in certain places. It feels like I'm sitting, or maybe laying down. Or maybe I was sitting and then lying but I don’t remember. Anyways all of a sudden the though of death came to mind and maybe I was dying. And then BOOM it hit me, I was.I realize again I'm dying; this strange pressure is felt around my nose. I wonder what it is for a moment and then forget again. Then it clicks it’s a nasal airway the paramedics had put on me. I couldn’t see this or see them or hear them, but at the time I was attending school to be a paramedic and knew exactly what this nasal airway felt like. T+05:00 – I wake up in the hospital with my girlfriend and one of my roommates there with me. I don’t know how I got there. I can think just fine but I can’t talk, it takes me forever to try to convert what I am trying to say into words. The nurse asks me why I'm there and I proceed to explain I was in a car accident. Its hours before they let me go.So if you're wondering what happened in all the time I was unconscious, well lucky for me someone told me the whole story.After I screamed for help in the bathroom sober people helped me back to my room. I asked for another cig so they got me one and tried to light it, but every time they would try to light it I would let a big breath out and put the lighter out. After a while they stopped trying and left me alone just thinking I was having a bad trip. I guess I came out of my room into the living room and I start screaming out of the living room windows and try to climb out of them. My friends start to get a little worried and call my girlfriend and explain I'm having a bad trip and she should come home. She gets home and I'm sitting on the stairs that lead from the living room to the kitchen. My girlfriend said that she stood face to face with me and I did not see her and that I actually looked through her. I suppose after some time I decide its time to try to run across a table with 3 bongs on it and so I do, I knock one of the bongs over and break it, and then go smashing off the table into a couch and over the couch onto the floor, face first. I start coughing up blood at this point which is later found to be from my tongue that I bit through from eating shit over the couch. Then all of a sudden I start to have a seizure. At this point I am sitting in an open space behind 2 couches next to a lamp, and my girlfriend and some other people are there making sure I'm ok after the fall. So I start to seize and they are all freaking out, then I stop breathing, and they start freaking out even more, my girlfriends said that after I stopped breathing my face started to turn blue and she put her head to my chest and could hear my heart beat getting slower and slower. At this point I am told my girlfriend and other friends are standing around me screaming for me to start breathing again. After about 3 minutes I start to breath again and my girlfriend decides its time to get to the hospital. Another friend tells her that they need to call an ambulance because at the rate I was going I would die in the back of her car. My girlfriend and roommate clear everyone in the house out, due to J and R still tripping balls, and lots of weed and paraphernalia around the house.I guess I kept trying to sit up on the stretcher so they had to strap me down. And then boom, wake up in a hospital bed, unable to talk and have to get a CT scan to check for brain damage. I was told by the doctor that the reason for the adverse reaction was the fact that I had mixed acid with lithium, and the fact that I hadn’t taken it that day meant nothing, because it was still in my body from the months of prior usage, (Recently diagnosed bi-polar at the time). So a warning to all taking lithium, do not mix with any chemical drugs, lithium is very powerful anyways and adding another chemical into your body that fucks with chemicals in your brain is a bad idea. A friend of J’s actually did the same thing after my experience but had not heard of what ended up happening to me, unfortunately his friends who where all tripping with no sitter (always have a sitter) just thought he was having a bad trip and put him in his room and left him there all night, he ended up being in a coma for 8 days, I was lucky enough to get the medical attention within just a few hours after ingesting the acid.Exp Year: 2008ExpID: 83935Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 22 Published: Oct 3, 2010Views: 27,331    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3) DOSE:100 mgoralMDMA(powder / crystals) 3 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab) 2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)   repeatedsmokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:135 lbThis experience was the most intense foray into psychedelia that I’ve ever had. It was also the singly best and worst night of my life. It started on a regular Saturday night. I had just obtained some great molly to my excitement, as I hadn’t had good stuff for many many months. My friend H and I were just chilling at my apartment. I was kind of hesitant to take it for whatever reason but knew that I would still thank myself in the end. I weighed out ~100 mg and parachuted it.I began to feel a little odd and knew I was coming up. Then, in about 40 minutes it hit me completely; I was rolling harder than ever before. I began to dance ecstatically and H put on some music. I was just massaging my whole body and talking a mile a minute. H was completely sober, but I tried to get her to open up to me completely and began psychoanalyzing her life inadvertently. She told me that everything I was saying was true, but she hadn’t come to terms with it yet and needed to mule it over.At this point I decided to take some acid on a whim, so I went to my stockpile and dropped 3 hits of this amazing rainbow children blotter I had. H expressed some concern, as I had not originally intended to do any acid. I was completely confident in my decision though and couldn’t have been more happy with myself and what I was going to experience. H asked me if I wanted to go outside and run with her and I replied with a definite YES! I got some water and a pacifier to chew on for the road. As we were leaving, our friends John and Joey popped by randomly and we vaporized a bowl together. I was really happy to see them and they wished me the best of luck on my trip. After they left we set out down the neighborhood in a jog. I ran until I noticed my heart was beating very FAST and I was getting lightheaded. I listened to the signs of my body and decided to slow down and drink some water to cool off. At this point the acid really kicked in and I felt like I was popping in and out of the space-time domain and dancing with the cosmos. We made it to a small elementary school park and I immediately lay down in the grass of a field. I looked out at the sky and saw the most beautiful cloud formations and the stars appeared to be raining out of the sky. I was so happy and had never seen so much beauty before. Everything was ALIVE! Everything I looked at was breathing in the energy of life and absolutely flowing. I could see every molecule that composed everything I saw, no matter how close of far away it was. All my senses were enhanced and I experienced them as one: beyond the senses.I began to get astounding and glorious revelations. I saw that everything was composed of one basic building block fractal that would create patterns to give off the appearance of form. I new that this fractal was pure and absolute love, the creator and the creation fused as one- God, energy, light, whatever you wish to call it, this is what it was. And I realized that nothing was static either-everything was always moving, flowing, going through a continuous cycle of life, death, and rebirth. I realized that although it was always changing, it was infinite, and to be part of the cycle is what it means to be alive. I saw everything that appeared to be still was simply slowly moving particles of this energy life force, vibrating at such a low rate that our ordinary senses perceive it as solid. I almost cried for joy at this realization- all was love, all was one.I reflected on the concept of the OM and understood it completely. I also realized that since everything was composed of love/God everything was whole, at every moment. I could never be separate from God, I was God, God was inside of me and God was EVERYTHING. This thought gave me so much comfort because I knew I would never be alone. As I was telling this to H she asked me where fear fit into the picture. I instantly knew that fear was only a lack of awareness of love and it is only a flaw of perception. I continued to ponder and gaze at the sky, watching the clouds dance and flow with rainbow iridescence around the moon. Sometimes I felt like I was right up there with them.After a while a light turned on in the school and H told me she thought she saw someone. We were trespassing, so we decided to just leave and not take any chances. We went back to my apartment and I lay on a yoga mat outside and continued to stare at the heavens and talk to her ecstatically. She told me I looked absolutely comfortable and I replied that I was. I decided to paint and began to mix colors randomly and paint an erratic pattern all over the canvas. She told me that she enjoyed how free I was being and I smiled and continued to paint until I was out of space. I didn’t want to come back for awhile and decided to take 2 more hits. I contemplated taking more molly and even some shrooms, but decided not to get too crazy.At this point I began to try to talk to H again about her life because I wanted her to find the peace and love that I had found also. When she spoke to me I could see which parent had given her which specific personality traits and her face actually morphed to portray either parent which I found absolutely crazy. I was still tripping madly at this point and space and time were so skewed that I was having a lot of trouble staying in a linear conversation as my mind was bouncing all over the place.. I told her everything I had realized and that she could have it too. I decided that I would give her the same illumination I had discovered since I had discovered the power of creation by calling it out of the universe.This is when things started to get really crazy. I knew that to transmit the enlightenment I would have to put it into a shape that she could access. I asked her what she wanted to be, what she most clearly identified with, what she was most passionate about- so I could mold the energy into shape for her to access. She kept on replying that she didn’t know and this exasperated and frightened me. For some reason I felt that she was right here experiencing my consciousness with me and couldn’t fathom why she couldn’t see it. She began to get defensive and talked about how she often struggles with depression in life. This is when my trip got really bad. The molly had worn itself through and I realized that it wasn’t coming back. I began to feel like our friendship was over- I was moving on, choosing to live completely in the light, whereas she was still partially enveloped by darkness. I wanted her to come with me but she wasn’t ready, she was still afraid. I thought I would lose her completely and this greatly saddened me-for her sake especially because she wouldn’t understand. All the energy I had called out of the universe to give to her was still hanging over my head, enveloping me. I couldn’t put it back, so I absorbed it and it became all of her fear and sadness.This is when I went to hell. I quickly and shakily said goodnight to H, who was in the process of passing out. She asked if I was ok and I lied because I knew that there was nothing she could do to help me, especially if this is the point I had gotten to trying to help her. I walked out onto my balcony again-I had left the door open and saw my black cat disappear into the darkness. I think she jumped into my neighbor’s balcony but I was tripping so hard I felt like I had lost her forever. This triggered my absolute descent into the lower realms of HELL. I began to feel like absolute shit. I was lost, wandering aimlessly looking for the peace, love, and beauty I had felt before but all I could see was darkness and terror.I tried to go to sleep but felt like H was a giant spider in a cocoon who wove a machine-like web sucking out my soul. I got up and began to pace the house. I tried to do everything I could think of that would make me feel better-meditation, yoga, chakra cleansing, cleaning, painting, singing, dancing, watching planet earth. Nothing helped, I simply couldn’t focus at all on anything I tried. I took some melatonin and gaba pentin to try and kill my trip early so I could sleep and at least find peace there. I wanted to die. I felt like I was eternally trapped by pain and demons began to haunt my thoughts. They sounded like really ghetto trashy fucked up people and kept repeating a barrage of cuss words, shouting into my brain “bitch ass nig motha fucka shithead douchbag asshole fuck fuck fuck..” and so on. I couldn’t make them go away.This madness went on for about 3 hours. Finally I decided to eat because I hadn’t in over 15 hours and felt kind of weak. I fixed myself some really healthy cereal with raisins, strawberries, and raspberries and then went outside to eat it. It was about 7 and the sun had begun to rise in a fuchsia glow behind the clouds. I turned and saw a black flash and my cat reappeared on my balcony and went inside. I felt so much relief with her return I almost cried again. With this sign and the new day I finally found hope and redemption-rebirth. I gazed at the tree out my window and still saw the fractal molecules of love that it was flowing with. I stared at it intently and saw it breathing-full of energy and life. I watched the water vapor molecules that formed clouds in the distance morph and swirl with the wind. They turned into images of people and animals and I saw a historic play take place inside of them. Ancient looking Asian women were washing clothes in a river one moment and then the scene would shift to a tiger hunting its prey, so on so forth. This captivated me and I felt like it was a web of history of the earth. I began to let go of the fear until it was no longer dominating me. After a while visuals stopped and I realized my trip was over. It was now about 8:30 and I was ready to sleep. I smoked a bowl and went to bed. This trip was really complicated. It was the most intense, enlightening, and painful one I had ever had. I spent the complete following day putting my mind back together and coming in terms with reality. It was my first candyflip, first bad acid trip, and most acid I had ever taken. Of these things, it probably won’t be my last. Because I entered a lower realm, I really wanted to try and dose again, but decided to give my mind at least a week or so to recover. Even though the ending was only bittersweet, this trip changed my life for the better. I feel like I truly understand the mysteries of life and my purpose in the puzzle- to give and manifest love. I decided to start attending Kundalini yoga at least twice a week as well as to give smoking weed a break (for the past 3 months I had been smoking incessantly and for the first time in my life began experiencing lapses of memory that comes with THC saturation). I no longer would allow myself to abuse my mind, my body, and my soul by not appreciating marijuana for the sacrament it is. This experience was yesterday, but I have been keeping true to myself so far and intend to hold my enlightenment within and continue tripping periodically to stay in touch with my true nature.Exp Year: 2010ExpID: 87422Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 18 Published: Oct 7, 2010Views: 119,415    MDMA (3), LSD (2) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Mystical Experiences (9), Relationships (44), Therapeutic Intent or Outcome (49), Difficult Experiences (5), Various (28) DOSE:8 dropsoralLSDBODY WEIGHT:150 lbI was down in Washington DC for school and I was pretty bored one night and my friend was going to a rave in the city at a random location.  Good idea I thought.  we got to the rave and it was pretty small with a good flow of drugs but I felt I needed acid because I haven't done it before.  My friend said that he knew somebody with drops.  To cut to the chase he came over and I purchased 4 drops.  I held out my hand and he dosed me.  after he yelled over the music,'did I get you?'.  I saw my opportunity 'no man' I said so he dosed me 4 once again.  Looking down at the puddle on me hand I put it to my mouth and licked it up..sssllluurrppp...  after about an hour I felt the world turn inside out and the fucked upness was beyond anything that I have ever seen.  I saw blue and red static (if you've been really fucked you know what I'm talking about) that static then turned into hallucinations.  The walls were flowing like goddamn waterfalls and the graffitti on the walls were floating by me.  Why the fuck are all these people dancing?  what is dancing?  why do we move to these strange vibrations in the air.  What's strange is that I could see the music vibrations in the air. Jjungle 'music' really messes with you.  I remember that during the trip that everything was too clear and so clear that all I wanted to do was kill myself. The reality of the world was too much for me to take.  The sparkle of life was taken away and I saw the behind the scenes look at life and it was depressing as hell.  Life was falling apart at the seams and I had to sit at this apartment with people I didn't know and listen to them talk about the most pointless things.  But I noticed that they were all putting blankets around each other and there was a wind blowing through the room (it wasn't wind from outside.) It was like they were helping each other survive.  I wondered what are they surviving against? After thinking I came to the conclusion, LIFE.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 11053Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 9, 2010Views: 6,783    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), First Times (2), Rave / Dance Event (18) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:180 lbThis happened when I was living in the dorms at Cal State Long Beach in the mid-80s. My friend Dave (not his real name) got some tickets to see Jane Siberry at the Wiltern theater in downtown L.A., and I had four hits of some pretty decent blotter acid. We went downtown pretty early, dropped the hits so that we would be coming on when the show started. Needless to say the show was excellent. Afterwards we walked around downtown (!) to come down a bit. We wandered into the courtyard of the Ahmonson Financial Plaza and began swinging from trees. A kindly old security guard came out, and we thought he was going to make us leave but instead we ended up talking to him for a couple hours, he was really cool. He had lots of great stories to tell.By that point I had come down enough to feel okay about driving, so we headed back to Long Beach. On the way home, we dropped the remaining two tabs of blotter acid.  [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  Back at the dorms, we were hanging out in the lounge watching some weird 1968 vampire movie and lighting Cremora packets (sprinkle Cremora over an open flame and you get a pillar of fire 'Mr. Magico' style. Please do not attempt this, it's quite hazardous). After a couple of those, the dorm fire alarm went off. We ran out of the building into an adjacent field, where we started talking about earthquakes (there had been a few the previous week). Dave began to sing 'gonna let it happen, let it happen', and we started dancing around. The second dose started to kick in, and that's when things changed for me.As I looked around, the rocks on the ground became children's skulls, the clouds were sinister skull-faces, and the trees were all evil and gnarled like those ones in old Disney movies, but more sinister. I began to have the sensation that the ground wanted to swallow me up. I notified Dave of this development, much to his dismay. At that moment I had the strangest sensation: I felt like the thumb of Death was stroking me from my sternum down my belly, kind of playing with me. I seriously believed I was about to be swallowed up by the earth. I needed to get back to some pavement, and quickly. As we walked back to the street, Dave was kind enough to point out how the muddy tire tracks resembled rib cages and spinal cords. I have never been so glad to see asphalt.I hung out with Dave for the rest of the night, and finally felt okay when the sun came up and transformed the curtains into gently pulsating translucent rainbow sheets. Later that day I was telling my story to a couple of gals in my building, and one of them remarked that the field was actually a Native American burial site. I know that death imagery is a common theme for LSD hallucinations, but it never really bothered me until that night. Dancing skeletons with uncle sam hats is one thing, but getting swallowed into the ground? After that, each time I passed the field, tripping or not, it always filled my heart with trepidation. The following year the state of California paved the field and turned it into a parking lot. I never parked my car in that lot.Exp Year: 1987ExpID: 13251Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 9, 2010Views: 5,533    LSD (2) : Alone (16), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:1 hitoralLSDBODY WEIGHT:180 lbIn 1984 I was relatively new to LSD, having only tripped a few times before. My friend R introduced me to it with some Orange Pyramid. The first and second trips we took together were absolutely mind-blowing, in a good way. To this day I still can't properly put them into words. However this is about our third trip. And it is still with me to this day.We had gotten hold of some Green Pyramid this time. Just like before, we had it all planned out very carefully. Around 6pm, R came over to the house and after a few minutes we dropped the cid. We sat around for a while listening to music and talking. Finally, after around an hour or so, R asks me 'are you tripping? Look at your eyes dude... are you tripping?'I said, 'hell yes, this is gonna be great!' Another 5 or 10 minutes went by and he asked again, 'are you tripping?' I said 'yeah, aren't you tripping yet?' That's when he stood up and said, 'I never took mine. I have to go. You're a drug addict now. I've transformed you. Look at yourself.' And walked out.My entire existence came crashing down in one massive swirling nuclear Acid bomb. Everything was exactly the opposite of those fantastic trips I had on the Orange Pyramid. Everything was black, poisoned, burnt, and death was everywhere. I sat there in shock at what I knew was going to be a very long night. And I wanted to kill my friend for setting me up for this experience. I know now that he did it because he was curious about how it would turn out and knew I could handle it. But I still wish I could return the favor someday.The incredibly beauty of the music turned into a hollow, vile mocking of me and everything I was about. And if this wasn't bad enough, R's last words to me came rushing back.... 'you're a drug addict now. Look at yourself....' and I got up and looked at myself in the mirror. Worst mistake ever.My eyes were completely black. This was very good acid and if the bad was anything like the good, this was going to be hell. I saw myself, dirty and disgusting and withering away. In my mind was repeating DRUG ADDICT, PATHETIC LOSER, YOU'RE IN HELL NOW BOY. YOU'VE DONE IT THIS TIME. I thought, I will never amount to anything because I've poisoned my existence with this shit. This must be what the whole world is like. Pointless existence and death.And then the flesh melted off my face. The whole room was swirling with demons and death, and I sat there staring in the mirror for 14 fucking hours thinking DRUG ADDICT. DEATH. ETERNAL HELL. POISON. BLACKNESS.I stood up and tried to shake it off a few times with no luck. Kept telling myself, 'this is just a drug like before. I know it's bad, but I WILL come out of this.' I looked at my eyes again in the mirror and thought, 'Holy fuck man, I am freaking the fuck out!' I was too. I was tripping hardcore in a black burnt up hell on earth, and it was all my fault. Everything was my fault. The world was going to die because I took this stupid acid. I wanted to die.It was worse than I can probably ever descibe in any language, but the only thing that kept me from killing myself that night was an anchor to reality based on pure fascination with LSD. I remembered the amizing trips I had before and thought, 'those were so great.... this must be the other side of it. This must be a bad trip.' And then everything that R did and said to create this hell made perfect sense. I thought, good stuff and great music makes it awesome, and bad shit and betrayal turns it black.And somehow knowing that made it better. The trip remained bad until I finally came down, but for the remainder I was able to see it for what it was. And experience on the dark side of LSD. I still look back at that night with that frame of mind. I was in hell at the time, but I know it wasn't real. I've tripped several times since then, and even had a few times when friends tried to steer me into the black with everything they could think of. But having gone through that, I'm able to not let it take hold anymore. I can force myself to have a good trip instead regardless of the situation. (although I still am careful not to tempt it.) I think it's because R did that to me on purpose, to show me what can happen. If it had happened without any logical reason, I don't know if I would have lived through it.I do not recommend doing this to anyone. I was fortunate to have a strong mind and be able to work through it. This could seriously damage someone. Always trip safe. And hopefully by reading this, if a bad trip should come upon you, you might have some more mental tools to fight it off. Never forget, it is just a drug, and you WILL come out of it.Exp Year: 1984ExpID: 65740Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 1, 2010Views: 9,742    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Alone (16) DOSE:  oralLSD(tea)BODY WEIGHT:135 lbI’ve taken LSD dozens of times, and have almost always had extremely positive, insightful experiences with it.  However, last spring I made the mistake of taking way too much acid while home alone.  The experience still haunts me, and thus it’s the one I’m compelled to write about.  I’d rather bury it forever, but I know I’ll never forget; it still preoccupies me daily.My husband Dan and I had recently moved to a new house in the mountains.  It was Dan who introduced me to psychedelics many years ago, and we had a good supply on hand, but lately Dan had soured on the idea of tripping, suspecting that the stress of his new job would feed into a bad mindset.  Meanwhile, I had been building up the idea of a solo trip as a way to treat myself to a glorious experience of our new home.  Dan didn’t like the idea of me tripping without him and had framed it as an issue of trust, so I simply intended to hide it from him.  That was my first big mistake.Dan left for work at 8:30 a.m., and shortly thereafter I brewed a lysergic tea by squeezing out the remains of an old bottle into warm water.  Our dealer Benjamin had given me one of his nearly-spent bottles, and I thought I had already squeezed it dry.  I anticipated, at most, one or two doses’ worth of acid to be left when I submersed the bottle into my tea.  That was my second big mistake.I drank the tea, and within mere minutes my heart began surging, my body jittering, and visual phenomena deepening and throbbing.  These were much swifter, stronger effects than I’d ever experienced, so I knew with sudden dread that I was in for a long, wild ride.Fear made a catastrophic jumping-off point for the trip.  At first I tried to busy myself cleaning up the house, to keep active, but panic swamped me, along with deep feelings of guilt.  I staged a mental dialogue with Dan, attempting to explain my whimsical dosage: “I want experiences all to myself sometimes!  I don’t like feeling controlled!”  But my own words sounded like hollow lies, because I could see that Dan was right about LSD not being something to trifle with whimsically, or seize greedily, or lie about.  I began to sob, seeing myself as a snake, a liar, a self-deluded creature of the darkness.“You can’t hide from the eyes of God,” I began weeping, collapsing onto the floor.  I’m not at all religious, yet for a while I kept wailing that: “You can’t hide from the eyes of God.”Then my mind started to slip into incomprehension, with syllables cycling senselessly in my ears: “Abwor-shuh-throl Rech-uh-sli Boppoli, Abwor-shuh-throl Rech-uh-sli Boppoli.”  I thought I should call Benjamin, my dealer back in Oregon, just wanting to hear one voice of sanity.  I called his cell, and when he asked “how are you,” I answered, “Actually, I’m scared.  I’m calling you because you seem like the kind of guy who knows what’s going on.  I took too much of the stuff you gave me, and I feel like I’m losing my mind...”He was very kind, and said all the right things to calm me down for a few minutes.  I felt better, until it occurred to me that cell phone conversations are easily tapped, and for all I knew he could be under surveillance.  I may have just wrecked our lives!  But I didn’t know how to speak this fear safely on the phone, so I just started saying “I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” before hanging up.Then things began getting stranger.  I stripped naked, and heard a voice say, “Psychedelic drugs are all part of the universal ecosystem’s experiment in consciousness.”  I thought, I knew it, and felt momentary comfort.But the voices were only beginning.  A distinct auditory group-voice began chanting to me.  First it said “Welcome!  You made it; we’ve been expecting you,” and I knew that these were the voices of all the other acid-heads who had broken on through to the other side.  THIS was where acid brought you, to a collective consciousness, the cross-planetary experiment!  People who had only ever taken a little acid only caught glimpses.  I laughed in bliss, and cried, “I’m here!  I see now!”But then the voices started saying, “We keep TELLING you, and you keep FORGETTING...”What?  What was I forgetting?  I suddenly sensed that I was mentally retarded, and all of society had evolved without me; I had been living in blighted ignorance for years.  I was allowed to keep living, because this was a just society that pitied me, but I was neglecting my responsibilities to the universe – and only sometimes were they important, but THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE TIMES.“We keep TELLING you, and you keep FORGETTING...”Forgetting what?  Forgetting to treat acid reverently?  Forgetting that it’s best taken in honesty and with other people?  Forgetting how to calm down and be an evolved person?  Or were there things I needed to do?I couldn’t calm down; I was running upstairs and down, throwing clothes out of my closet and back in again, putting on clothes and then stripping them off instantly.  I vomited first into one toilet, then into another, and sprinted around the house, as the syllables kept cycling “Abwor-shuh-throl Rech-uh-sli Boppoli.”  Downstairs in the dark hallway I wailed, “I feel like I’m LOSING my MIND!”Buzzes, beeps, knocking, sirens, telephones ringing.  What were these sounds?  I realized I was holding my cell phone, and tried to answer it, desperately wailing, “Hello?!”“You’re caught in the grip of the time-matrix,” the voices said.  “But it’s only one mode of experience.”I envisioned my friend Joe, whom I hadn’t seen in years but had recently found on Facebook, saying the word “TIME.”  In reality it was the punchline to a joke he made years ago, but I suddenly understood that the whole reason he’d reappeared in my life recently, or at all, was to show me that time is false.  He, and my friend Pam, and other people with whom I’d recently reconnected, had all been planted in this mock-up of existence; they weren’t real except to show me that time wasn’t real...“Your family members are just place-holders; THIS is your reality.  You’re not real to your family, either; you’re a shell to them, and they’ll never see your mind.”Buzzz!  Beep!  Clang-clang!  Brrring!“Your parents are trying desperately to reach you, but you can’t answer the phone...”I envisioned myself strapped down in a mental ward as my heartbroken parents wept for my lost mind.  Brrrring!  They were trying to reach me!  I desperately picked up every phone in the house, screaming, “HELLO?”  But I heard nothing, only the voices saying, “We keep TELLING you, and you keep FORGETTING...”Because I’m retarded!  They keep telling me how to live, and I keep forgetting, because I’m mentally disabled!   Everyone else lives in an evolved way, while I keep dragging the Collective Consciousness into my own psychological muck, because I’m a mentally retarded drain on the Cosmic Society!  That must mean there’s still something I need to do...I started watering the plants obsessively, changing my cats’ food and water bowls, sensing that my task had something to do with tending for other lifeforms.  But I was running out of time... time?“Look,” said a male voice, “normally your time is your own, and you can waste it if you want.  But NOW is a point when TIME REALLY MATTERS.  There are many people depending on you RIGHT NOW.  We NEED you to do this NOW.”Do what?  I was retarded; I didn’t even know what he was talking about!  But I suddenly knew that all eyes were on me.  People were watching me, listening to me… how?  The cell phone!  I was still holding it; I must have dialed someone!  Word got out and spread instantly; now everyone knows I’m insane and retarded!A roaring in the sky, a helicopter:  oh my god, they called the authorities.  They could not only hear me on the phone, but see me from the sky.  This story would make the news!  My life would never be the same!The male voice was insistent.  “I know you keep forgetting, and have to keep being reminded.  But this is IMPORTANT.  Every second you waste causes GREAT HARM.”“What do you want me to DO?” I screamed.  “You keep reminding me!  And I keep forgetting!”Tend... give... create, was kind of the group-mind answer.  I looked at my cats, who were staring at me with scared wide eyes.  I suddenly had the crazy idea that the police/news helicopter outside thought I was holding the cats hostage.  Feline hostage crisis!  If only I could talk to my husband; he could help me clear this up!  “Dan,” I moaned. “I’m sorry, Dan; Dan, I love you.”Then Dan’s voice sounded in my ears: “I didn’t expect you to do this, certainly not on such a grand scale.  But now that it’s done, try to take the higher path.  Every moment of your life is an opportunity to create and give.”  And I sensed that he knew; he had been to the other side, but he had to let me figure this out for myself.I went to the upstairs window and told the helicopter/cell phone/group-mind, “This is all a universal experiment in collective consciousness.  No one ever talks about it, but it’s time we talk about it!  The trips we have; the glimpses we get; the matrixes of reality!”And then I sensed how I was a player in the universe’s grand stage play, amnesiac as ever, unprepared but learning, maybe even a prophet now.  Sometimes you played one role, sometimes another, sometimes all in the same hour.  Sometimes you were a dark, grasping, gaping hole of pure need – which I associated with my dark downstairs – and sometimes you were a wise, giving fountain of light and love, which I associated with my sun-lit upstairs and its distant mountain views.  Anyone could play either role at any time, and psychedelics helped us empathize with the needy ones and taste the gratifying bliss of being one of the strong ones, as well.   Sometimes you’re down there and sometimes you’re up here.  The voices told me, “Oh well, it keeps life interesting.  It’s all part of the gaian mind.”So I started to feel more peaceful, but was still utterly confused.  I was thinking things like, “I was on live TV and the whole world now knows I’m an acid-head, but at least they no longer think I’m holding my cats hostage.”  And, “Will I get arrested for taking psychedelics and involving the police?”  Then, “No, psychedelics are legal!  How could they not be, when they’re what the reality game is about?  It makes no sense for them to be illegal.”So I started wondering, “Why did I think they were illegal?”  And I saw all of my life and experiences that had led up to me meeting Benjamin and acquiring the dregs of his acid-bottle as having been set up for me by the Collective, intentionally stage-set.  It was all planned!  All of the elements had been knowingly placed for me to create this moment of un-knowing.   But what did it mean?Every question I asked, the voices had an answer for.  “The telephone you keep hearing, that’s your life calling.  You can choose to reach out and connect to the universe, or you can let the ringing drive you mad.”  And the thing about time: “It’s not the only matrix.  Things across time are well connected, and simultaneous things are still worlds apart.”The peak of the trip lasted until about 5:00, at which point I very suddenly came down enough to realize how much of it had been a fantasia.  In reality I had made no phone calls after my initial call to Benjamin; there had been no police or TV news presence; this had all been a madly dramatic projection of my own psychology.  I sensed sanity returning and whimpered, “Oh, thank god thank god thank god.”I was so humbled by this trip that I still haven’t talked about it to Dan.  I’d like to someday, since I still feel bad for having eluded his trust in me.  I still hope Benjamin’s phone wasn’t tapped.  And now, every day, my own house’s interior sights still trigger visceral memories of that trip; I am condemned to remember.If I may conclude with a bit of dogmatism, the moral of this story is to know your dose.  And please be honest with your loved ones and yourself.Exp Year: 2009ExpID: 81564Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 32 Published: Nov 12, 2010Views: 22,745    LSD (2) : Entities / Beings (37), Overdose (29), Bad Trips (6), Alone (16) DOSE: T+ 0:003 hits LSD   T+ 3:001 hitsmokedSalvia divinorum(leaves)BODY WEIGHT:150 lbThis was the most intense and the best acid trip I've ever had, and I'd tell you all about it, but there are plenty of trip reports based on LSD alone, so I'll just write the pertinant information- the trip after I smoked Salvia divinorum.I took three hits of LSD (my friend had done the same earlier in the day) and had a wonderful experience while peaking. However, about 3 hours into the trip, the peak ended, and I was very disappointed. The intense visuals had entirely disappeared. My friend told me to smoke marijuana to get them back, but I had a drug test in 3 days so that wasn't an option. Instead, I went to my car and pulled out a bag of natural strength salvia divinorum (usually way too weak to smoke by itself) and brought it inside.We turned off the lights, the only illumination left was coming off the computer screen and a static tv. Some really terrible rap music was playing, I like hippie music, so this didn’t thrill me. My friend (who was more sober at this point) packed some salvia into a bowl of a sophisticated bong (diffuser stems, all kinds of crap) and lit up. I remember being fascinated by the strange, green smoke that was filling up the chamber. He took a HUGE hit and immediately began coughing terribly. He vomited into a garbage can and said, “That was the weirdest puke I’ve ever taken” (for this kid, that’s saying something) and added, “Smoke this shit if you want to, I’m sticking to pot.” He packed a bowl of salvia for me, and helped me work the bong, since he’s a much more experienced smoker. I took just one hit of this natural strength salvia, enough that it was a little uncomfortable, and held it for as long as I could…I was laughing, uncontrollably and for no reason. My friend was laughing too. I just stared into his face, and he stared back, with a strange glow around his face and pitch darkness everywhere else. Suddenly it wasn’t a face anymore- just a personality, a spirit- the only physical manifestation he had was a devious smile and yellow eyes, think Cheshire Cat. Things became extremely abstract- everything in the universe disappeared except for our roaring laughter, my mind, my friend’s personality, and a frightening droning in the background.Things flickered- some memories flashed by, though I can’t remember details at all, and it seemed only to last for milliseconds. Now I was really scared. I was stuck. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t stop laughing. My friend’s face was becoming more and more evil. I felt like my consciousness was being shot back and forth between my mind and the location of my friend’s personality at light speed. It seemed this loop had lasted for years… When would it end? I was sure I was stuck in this perpetual nightmare fore eternity… I used all my willpower and shook myself out of the trance. The room came back, and it was hard to tear my gaze from my friends face, which had normalized, somewhat. The terrible rap music was still playing. “Holy shit” I muttered. “I almost got stuck in a loop forever.”“How?” my friend asked. I tried to explain it, but it was just impossible. “Do you remember all of that?” I asked. “Remember what?” he replied.“All of what just happened… Holy shit, I can’t believe I came out of that. What happened?”“You just kind of stared at me, and kept laughing, and then you…”But I couldn’t hear him anymore. I was petrified. The music was terrible, it had to stop.“Stop it, man. Turn off the music. Turn it off! The trip’s getting bad, it’s getting real bad…” The music stopped, but it just made things worse. The entire universe was immersed in a petrifying silence. He went and turned on the lights. There were terrible, intense hallucinations in my peripheral vision. I was really scared, scared that I’d never return to reality. I started thinking about my uncle, who was schizophrenic, about all the psychedelics I’d done and how stupid I was for pushing it…The room flashed into hell. My friend had an expression of torment on his face, he was preying on my agony. Flames were licking his eyes. He started to say something to me, something terrible… I couldn’t control any part of the trip, and nothing seemed to resemble reality at all. I told myself I was hallucinating, I knew my best friend could not possibly be evil… I used all my energy and willpower to shake away the setting, to imagine my friend as he really was.The room came back, but it still had frightening aspects. “I’m scared,” I kept saying. “I’m questioning my sanity. Logan, Logan come here I need you!” And my friend ran to help me. My peripheral vision was the worst of everything- it seemed like I had a permanent frame around my eyes. I go scared I’d see that way forever. I couldn’t tell what was part of my body- It seemed like dressers, blankets, everything was part of me somehow. When I moved my arm it pixilated- little bits of matter just floated in space. I started thinking that the molecular structure of the universe was crumbling… It seemed like every bit of matter was somehow physically a part of me. I hated it. I kept questioning my sanity, wondering if I’d ever perceive things the same way again…More people came into the room, since I was making such a scene. “This is a bad trip, man. This is really bad… I gotta fix it.” All three trip sitters were really nice, but all three of them were on something, so I couldn’t tell what was part of reality and what wasn’t. I tried to calm myself down, I had become the feeling of panic. They told me the first step was to just chill, so I lay down. They put a blanket over me, and I just hated that sensation. I threw it off. I kept telling myself that the salvia trip was over, it only lasts a few minutes, I was fine… But I wasn’t fine. I was sure the drugs were no longer affecting me and I was in a psychosis, but I kept telling myself it wasn’t true. “What’s making the trip bad?” They asked me. It was hard for me to put it in words. “It needs to be happy… The trip’s not happy, its terrified… I keep getting stuck in loops man, so many loops…” and my mind was flooded with paradoxical things. The oroborous (a snake eating its own tail), the existence of God, molecular structure… I kept praying, praying over and over and asking God to forgive me for tampering with my mind. I then noticed that they were doing things to try and make me happier.“This is a really happy bag,” one kid said. “This is the happiest bag I’ve ever seen.” I looked into it and it was filled with candy, toys, colors, everything a 3 year old kid would be enthralled with. But I didn’t like it, there was something wrong with it. Then he held up a soft bear. “This is the softest thing I’ve ever felt. Look how amazing this guy is. Wouldn’t it be awesome if these things were real and our size? And they’d just walk around and smoke pot with us?” But I didn’t like that either. Their pet black cat came in and I started petting it, talking to it, trying anything to calm down.“Funyun?” one friend kept saying. Any time I looked at him, that’s all he would say. I was sure I was stuck in a loop of the past, like when a record gets stuck and repeats over and over… Another kid was drawing on the wall. He was stoned out of his mind, and any time I looked at him I was reminded of a mental institution. He kept saying the same things, looking at me with the same disturbing smile. All these loops… Everything was repeating itself, and I hated it.I looked to my best friend, Logan, and any time I looked at him floods of memories and emotions would rush passed my eyes, and I suddenly knew that I could never trip with him again, because we had existed together on so many levels, and that was part of what was triggering this psychotic reaction. Any time I asked Logan a question, he would just repeat it, in a different tone. All he seemed to do was echo me. Any time I wanted some sense of direction or a glimpse of reality he would just lead me in circles. “Are you hungry?” Logan asked, and I said yes, anything that might help me grip reality. He brought me a microwaved burrito. It was really strange eating it- it was half warm and half cold, and very spicy. My body just felt weirder after that. “I’m questioning my sanity.” I repeated. “Am I stuck this way?”“No,” Logan replied. “No, look at me. You’re not crazy. I’ve seen crazy people. You’re talking completely normal. This happens to everybody. You’ve been tripping only 4 hours and this stuff lasts about 12… You just weren’t expecting the salvia reaction.”But no matter how much he told me, deep down, I just couldn’t believe him. He recommended we go outside, but the darkness just made things worse. I still had frightening things going on in my peripheral vision, and I still couldn’t grasp the concept of matter and what was my actual physical property. I hated salvia- I hated it so much. I thought maybe if I destroyed it it would end the trip… I started talking about how evil it was, how it was of the devil. I told myself I’d never have to take acid again, even though I loved it, because I didn’t want to end up this way again, not even for an instant. I definitely would never smoke salvia again, it was something man was not supposed to play with.It seemed like hours since I had smoked the salvia. I was sure this bad trip would have ended by now. I told Logan, I told him we had to end the trip now. “Do you want some downers?” he asked. But I couldn’t, I had a drug test coming up. “We’ll just give you a sleeping pill. It won’t show up. It’s lunesta or something.” Suddenly I was very relieved. I would just go to sleep and wake up in the morning completely sane. Suddenly my entire existence was dependent on that one sleeping pill.I tried to be patient, but when my friends still hadn’t given me one I got really panicky. I almost started crying. He told me they belonged to his mom, and he couldn’t just tell her that his friend was freaking out and needed to be pacified. Tears were in my eyes. “Please,” I begged, “It’s really important.” He tried again, but in vain. I accepted that I wasn’t going to get one. I was still very unhappy and scared, and this was obvious.“Wanna play Mario?” Logan asked. “That’s happy.” I told him sure, anything. But it wouldn’t work, so he put in Mega Man instead. This was a SNES, and with my whole difficulty with matter at the time it was near impossible to differentiate myself from the controller from the game and everything just sort of blended into one environment. I kept dying, but was always relieved when I could just play the level again. I got a little less scared. But then the loops started again. I kept fighting the same robots. I kept playing the same sequence over and over. Was I psychotic? “Didn’t I just fight this guy?” I asked. “Didn’t I do this already?” But nobody answered, there was no help in sight. “I need to be grounded.” I said. “I just want to be grounded and to know what’s real.” I wished for dinner with my parents. I wished for times I played with my sister as a kid. I wished for watching the History Channel and for school and wished for anything that was routine and I knew was real.I handed off the controller to somebody else. Logan offered me a Mountain Dew. I said sure, and decided to use this as a placebo. “If you could just pass that over here,” I said, “and allow the good tripping to begin.” Logan laughed. Anything weird that happened I just dismissed, I just told myself it was the drugs and I’d come out of it eventually. After a while, the scary peripheral hallucinations stopped completely. I felt more and more normal. But any time I thought back and tried to review the events that had taken place, I’d get confused and toss myself into a bad trip again. With my willpower and with time I floated back to reality, and started making rational decisions again. I managed to fall asleep, and when I woke up I felt like I was glowing, but was indeed completely sane.This entire salvia experience lasted only about a half hour, my friends say. It seemed an eternity to me. Unless I feel like going into psychosis or astral exile, I won’t smoke salvia while acid tripping ever again. If I had done it while peaking, I think I’d be in a mental institution right now. I’m glad I did smoke the salvia, because it taught me a lot and certainly defined the trip, but I definitely wouldn’t do it again.Exp Year: 2007ExpID: 66148Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Dec 29, 2010Views: 21,649    LSD (2), Salvia divinorum (44) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Relationships (44), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:  repeatedsmokedCannabis(plant material) 3 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:150 lbSo a few months ago, I went to P-town (A city about 45 minutes from where I live) to visit an old friend (J). I went with my friend (C) who I never really felt completely comfortable with but am in complete denial of (mistake 1). I don't know why. Anyway we were staying with her dad.One of the nights, me, C, & J got way drunk. The next morning we all woke up completely hung over (mistake 2). We decided to go into town after moping around C's dad's house. We went to J's place because he had a few errands to run. That's where I met J's friend A. I have social anxiety so I wasn't feeling very comfortable with A, but I was trying my hardest to! Making small talk and whatnot.. But I was too hung-over to concentrate on anything. I don’t think C liked A very much.Once J was done, we went to a secluded area and smoked some pot. I don’t know how much, probably like 6-7 bowls. This was about normal for me. Then we each got a little blotter piece with 3 hits of good LSD on it. I tricked myself into thinking 'oh what the hay, I’ll be fine” So I made the call, and put the piece of paper under my tongue, and we left. (Biggest mistake.)When we left, I was still feeling pretty normal (well normal as I get..) But soon, A kept trying to talk to me and C but C wasn't talking at all and I felt a huge social indifference and couldn't really handle it so I just ended up not talking too. A didn't understand why me and C weren't talking to him. I think he took it offensively but I meant no harm, I'm just shy and scared of being social and what others are thinking. So him being frustrating by us made me feel even worse. I tried speaking a few times but just couldn’t do it. So I stared at the trees and focused on how pretty nature is, the whole time. While J listened to music on mini loud speakers.. I tried catching up with him to listen to music, but felt bad about leaving C back with A. So I really didn’t know what to do! So I just walked alone.Well we walked for a good 20-30 before we got to the bus to take us to our destination. The bus ride was about 10 minutes. We got to our destination which was a secluded park where all the stoners sit and toke up. When we got there, there were 2 other people already sitting under a tree, tripping on acid. So we all just sat in a circle. By that time, I was starting to feel it. But I was scared from feeling social contractions, and anxieties. I wanted to be alone. I got really cold, and decided to just look at the sky. The clouds starting to turn into animals and looked fuzzy. That made me happier, but being cold distracted me. The sun was going away.I remember sitting up and my phone ringing, it was my cousin (also my best friend). That made me smile, so I picked up. She was drunk, and walking back home. She said she was really scared because she was really intoxicated and had to face my uncle. I told her I was tripping and that everything was going to be okay but it really freaked me out. Once I hung up my mom called. I got really scared but calmed myself down quickly. I remember I didn’t feel very comfortable. Not comfortable at all, actually. And everyone could tell. Which made me feel worse. I remember C was like “Emily you look like you’re mom” which REALLY tripped me out. My mom has schizophrenia, and depression, and a bunch of other shit. I never want to be like her.  You’d know what I’m talking about if you knew me.So J & A were trying to calm me down, the other people had left and that made me feel better. I was shivering cold, and kept complaining about it. So we all huddled together in a little tiny circle, with all of our knee’s touching, around all of J’s stuff. I don’t remember if I wanted them to do that or something. They kept trying to get me to focus on things. But the only thing I could focus on was myself. Then the strong visuals came in and I went in and out of feeling really good to feeling horrible. I felt like the four of us created a house. A house with warmth. Then these two other people showed up and wanted to sit and smoke some bowls with us. So I had to move to let them in our house. That upsetted me. I was the door, and I was letting all the warmth out for these strangers. They had big ugly scary faces and for some reason I just did not like them. We started smoking bowls and all I remember was people kept telling me to pass the pipe, because I kept forgetting I had it. And C was doing the same thing which lead into this weird mind connection thing with her. After those people left, a bunch of new people showed up. I didn’t like that either! Everyone that formed my little “house” were all cartoons. And all those other people that showed up were all normal looking. I couldn’t focus on them at all.  Then I went through this trip inside my head. I couldn’t focus on anything going on outside of my head.  I went through my whole life inside my head, and felt as if I was “cursed” with something. My trip was my whole entire life and throughout my whole entire life I was not able to speak ever again. I was stuck in my head for eternity, and at the end of my life I was allowed to SCREAM finally. So, while I thought I wasn’t talking apparently I was repeating things like “hello? Hello? Hello?” A lot of desperate hellos. And “Is anybody there? Where are you? I am an elbow.” And then a lot of more hellos. Weird things like that.Then.. I don’t know how long it had been, I don’t know what I did throughout that whole time but suddenly I came into consciousness again, while we were walking down a path and I apparently just screamed. Then said “I’m done! It’s over I’m done!” Then stopped talking again. I was a ghost. That’s when I had an out of body experience. I remember watching myself and everyone walk down this path and I kept telling myself to go back because I had left my sanity at the park in a box! But I just kept walking, I was dead and could not do anything about it. I wanted to go back so badly, and go receive it. Then I came to acceptance that I had lost my sanity and will never have it back.Suddenly I awoke, not knowing where I was or anything that had happened besides what had happened in my head. We were at a playground, and I was sitting alone while everyone else was playing on stuff and having fun. I sat there for a long time contemplating if I was dead or not. Until somebody talked to me. I was hesitant to answer because I didn’t know if I was imagining them or not. Then we left to go get on the bus. While we were waiting for the bus, and everyone else already came out of their trip completely, everything still looked like a painting. A tried talking to me again, tried talking to me about a lot of things but I still was completely unresponsive. All I would say was “..yeah” and couldn’t concentrate on anything he was saying. It probably looked like I didn’t care. Me and C got on the bus and I remember looking at her and she still looked like a cartoon. That scared me. We got back to her dad’s house and I didn’t know what to do. I sat in bed and couldn’t sleep all night. Got up, and felt like I was on crack. I was scared and nothing felt normal. Everything felt weird in a bad way. Everything has felt weird in a bad way ever since, and I completely regret doing that. I’m severely depressed ever since. Everything has gotten so much worse. I isolate myself in my room. My whole personality reflects my trip. J & A don’t talk to me anymore, I don’t even know how they feel about me. I don’t talk very much anymore. I feel unable to communicate a lot. It’s hard for me to feel relaxed. I can’t smoke pot any more, I feel completely and utterly psychotic when I do. I can’t get comfortable and everything I do feels extremely weird and I can’t describe it. I get anxieties and shake and feel nauseous. I pretty much fucked myself up.Exp Year: 2007ExpID: 65728Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 1, 2011Views: 40,064    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Bad Trips (6), Post Trip Problems (8), Health Problems (27) DOSE:   LSD(blotter / tab)    MDMA     Mushrooms BODY WEIGHT:95 kgho avuto un bad trip nel 2001 nel campeggio di un concerto. ero con un sacco di amici, il trip andava per il verso giusto, anche se quella sera avevo esagerato parecchio con le droghe.

Crowd (24) DOSE:2 tabletsoralLSD(pill / tablet)BODY WEIGHT:180 lbI began using LSD in 1970, after a high-school acquaintance introduced me to someone who sold it right on campus. So I bought my first dose of LSD from a fellow student who had “Purple Microdot” stashed in his locker. My first experience with LSD was anticlimactic because I took a very small amount. Using a razor blade, I cut the one tablet I bought roughly in half, and then I halved it again, so that I only ingested about 1/4th of the tablet. I gave a friend a quarter of the tablet as well. He may have gotten more of the drug than I did because I really didn’t experience anything all that remarkable while he seemed to be somewhere in the stratosphere. He couldn’t even talk intelligibly to describe what was happening with him.The first LSD trip that brought on hallucinations occurred a couple of months later. I had bought a variety of the drug called “Orange Sunshine,” cut it in half and swallowed one of the halves. Within about 45 minutes to an hour, I began to see some incredible things, and I finally understood what people were talking about when they described seeing complex, pulsating geometric designs in bright day-glow colors and so forth. That evening, when I looked at the random designs painted on the ceiling of my bedroom, the textures in the paint began to form into very ornate geometric patterns that appeared to be 3-dimensional and swirling slowly into circles and vortexes. I saw very similar designs in my mind when I closed my eyes, except the colors were starker and more vibrant. The trip lasted about 6 hours, and I never left my bedroom. I just listened to music and watched the swirling, pulsating patterns and vibrant colors unfolding in my mind. And I saw some astounding things with my eyes closed before it was over. I enjoyed this experience immensely because I had never seen anything so beautiful and wondrous as the visions my imagination poured forth, so I began “experimenting” with LSD more frequently. I began to take a whole tablet at one time to ratchet up the intensity of the trip, and I began to love the LSD experience and look forward to repeating it whenever I was able to “score” the drug from someone selling it in my neighborhood. I thought the LSD experience was incredibly profound, even though I was a naive teenager who didn't know much about the world, and eventually I lost my sense of caution about the possible effects of an overdose. I began to think that if one tablet brought on a really beautiful trip, taking two tablets at a time would give me an even more fantastic trip. Big mistake!I bought several tablets of Orange Sunshine from a friend who had gotten it in California, and one sunny Saturday afternoon, I swallowed two tablets and waited for the light show in my head to begin. About 45 minutes later, I was feeling the first effects of the drug, so I put on an album by the Jefferson Airplane and lay down on my bed, closing my eyes to see what would appear in my mind. By this time I was beginning to see colors and starkly beautiful geometric shapes and patterns with my eyes closed, more intense and beautiful than ever before. My visions seemed to react to the sound of the music I was listening to. Each instrument being played on the album caused a pattern and color that corresponded to that specific sound. The bass created deeper, darker colors, and the sound of the guitar brought forth “warmer” colors like red and orange.After a while – I don’t know how long – the music began to sound warped and somehow a little ominous, so I got up and went into the living room. By this time, however, some extremely intense hallucinations were beginning to form all around me, and I realized, with more than a little anxiety, that the LSD was affecting me more than I had expected. I turned on the television set, and on one of the channels was a narrator or emcee, looking straight at the camera and talking to the viewing audience. All of a sudden I had the impression that he was looking straight at me and talking to me personally, as if he knew I was watching the program and was not just part of a random, anonymous viewing public. He was directing his remarks to me specifically. Then I realized that this was an irrational thought, and that scared me because I wasn’t just having incredible hallucinations but was beginning to think in a weird way – to be prone to believing things that were impossible if looked at logically. The loss of control over my mind was alarming. It evoked an emotional response that seemed to intensify the garish colors and designs, which by this time were totally animated and looping around the living room in an ominous, threatening way. That scared the hell out of me, so I went outside, hoping to escape the hallucinations in the bright sunlight. It didn’t help.What I saw outside was a completely chaotic scene, with animated designs and geometric shapes bouncing all around,floating on lawns, drooping from trees and hovering above the asphalt street while moving in spirals. Real objects such as the cars on the street looked distorted and warped. At that point I thought I was losing my mind, in which case I would have to be institutionalized for the rest of my life because I was never going to be sane and rational again. I felt a tremendous sense of grief over what I had inadvertently done to myself, and I began crying as I paced up and down the street, trying to calm down and keep it together. One of my neighbors was outside, and he saw I was in an agitated state. I managed to tell him what was happening, and he drove me to one of the drug treatment centers that existed in Phoenix at the time.The drive seemed to take forever, even though it probably only took about 20 minutes in reality because the center was not that far from my neighborhood. When we finally arrived there, several young men with long hair were sitting on a stoop outside. My neighbor turned to me and said something like, “Goddamned Hippies, they ought to open up a hunting season on them, just like quail.” I immediatly came to believe that this drug treatment center was really a front for distributing drugs, and I was more than a little paranoid about going inside. A couple of the young men sitting outside saw me as I got out of my neighbor's car, and they seemed to know what was the matter with me. In fact, I assumed they knew I was high on LSD by the way they looked at me.I was escorted into one of the rooms, a place with oriental rugs on the floor - kind of a dark space that was meant to be peaceful and relaxing to people who were as stressed out as I was at the time. Two of the volunteer counselors in this room tried to make small talk with me by asking me my name, what I did for a living, whether I was still in high school, etc. I couldn’t answer them because I was having a great deal of difficulty forming words and holding onto them long enough to keep a rational train of thought and engage in a normal conversation.Though this place was supposed to be a place where I could get some help, it appeared menacing to me, and I wondered what these people talking to me had up their sleeve. I didn’t trust them to help me. And I could hardly tell them what was going on inside my head, so I sat in silence and just observed people coming and going on the other side of the room, wondering if they were high on LSD lie I was. I must have sat there like that for a couple of hours. In the meantime, the frightening and garish hallucinations began to subside and grow fainter. I felt a tremendous sense of relief because I then realized that I wouldn’t be insane the rest of my life. I was going to be OK. I felt like crying for joy.After a few more hours I was calmed down and rational enough to realize my parents would be looking for me, so I decided to walk home. I must have taken my shoes off at one point, though I didn’t remember doing it, because I couldn’t find them and had to walk home barefooted, The counselors wanted me to stay a while, but I assured them I was down from the peak of the trip and that I could make it home safely.It was a truly terrifying experience, the most panic I had ever felt in my life, I was shaken and exhausted when it was all over, but incredibly relieved to be back on planet earth where I belonged. You would think that would be the end of my LSD use, but I eventually began using it again after my fear of repeating the bad trip had subsided. I rationalized it and thought the bad trip was an overdose that I could avoid repeating if I again used more caution.I never again tried taking a large dose all at once. I didn’t want to repeat the experience, so I took smaller amounts of LSD, and those trips were relatively uneventful though quite colorful and thought provoking. I finally quit taking LSD altogether because it lost its allure. Each trip was so similar to the ones I had experienced before that the novelty wore off. The last time I used LSD was about 27 years ago, but my memory of the bad trip remains clear. I will never forget that night.Exp Year: 1970ExpID: 66222Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Apr 4, 2012Views: 27,787    LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Nature / Outdoors (23), Music Discussion (22), Guides / Sitters (39), Hangover / Days After (46), Various (28) DOSE:10 hitsoralLSD(liquid)BODY WEIGHT:210 lbWell I didn’t think it was possible with the quality of most LSD I see these days, but it seems I finally achieved my lifelong goal of overdosing and completely flipping out. It was a Friday night and my trusty acid dealer arrived with the small squeeze-bottle vial. Usually she laughs hysterically at the number of hits I want to take, telling me I scare her. This time however, she just looked concerned and said “this is supposed to be really good stuff. Are you SURE you want to take 10?” At this I replied that I was so sure and she proceeded to squeeze the drops onto my tongue. 1,2,3,4,5,6- ok swish around, then 7,8,9,10. With the usual hug and ‘have a good trip!,’ she left me to my usual –coming up on large amounts of LSD- antics. My especially active roommate was gone for the weekend, and so I locked myself in my room and watched the end of this really strange Japanese zombie movie called ‘versus.’ The time was 1:50pmThe LSD came on stronger and faster than I had ever experienced. Usually I wait about two hours, wondering if I got ripped off. This time I ate very little in preparation, and by the 25 minute mark things were seriously near the overwhelming point. The white walls became trillions of colors with a repeating pattern that looked like the symbol for a cold front over and over again. I have only gotten sick on acid once before, but the intensity of the come up left me curled up on my bed with my face in the comforter, rolling around to try to stave off the nausea. I’m sure some out there know what I am talking about- its no normal nausea, it’s inconsistent and comes in rapid waves. What was initially an ecstatic mood at getting what seemed to be excellent acid turned into fear- this was coming on way too strong, way too fast. I remember lying on my bed looking at the different sized whirlpools swirling in the drywall and thinking “Just hold on, motherfucker!” For some reason I kept conceptualizing the amount of time I had been waiting for this trip, and it seemed to be a very tangible ‘amount’ of days bathed in this dreary sunset light and it made me feel unbearably depressed so I tried to banish it from my mind. By this point it was about an hour in and things were getting really intense. I looked at the underside of my hand and wrist and saw the veins scintillating and moving quickly like highways of ‘loading’ bars on the computer with the diagonal lines moving. The visuals were making me sick so I closed my eyes and saw this universe pattern with millions of different sized dots and stars made of different day-glo colors. It was all intensely beautiful but I felt too sick to appreciate it. I stood up to make my way to the bathroom to try to speed up the inevitable and found my balance was insanely off. I stumbled and almost fell over, then crawling over to my toilet and sitting cross-legged in front of it, cursing it for being so tall and not being usable with me in that sitting position because it was the only position I could think of at the moment. The visuals at this point were not as noticeable because I was looking around too fast to settle on something, and frankly was concerned with my survival more than the trip. I knew in the back of my head that no one has ever died from LSD itself, and so as long as I maintained some small measure of control and didn’t fling myself out a window or something I would be fine. It certainly didn’t feel that way though, I felt violently ill and my mind kept going back to how the current trip must compare to ergot poisoning. I kept trying to put on music to calm myself but it seemed loud and like it would alert my roommates that something was wrong with me so I kept turning it up then down, the mouse making ridiculously long trails on my computer screen. None of my usually fully memorized favorite songs and album titles made any sense, and I kept going in circles on iTunes trying to find something, all the while becoming more and more disoriented and frightened. I kept picturing paramedics bursting in my room and shoving tubes down my nose, and my parents crying and standing over my hospital bedside. A part of me said “no, I’m not going to let that happen.” Ironically my unstable window shades took this opportunity to come crashing off the wall and knock everything off my desk, making me trip over them in the process. Landing on my bed with low music playing, I laid there, trying to calm down and think what to do next to help myself. These strange sequences of action kept entering my head, like “ok turn down the music. Now lay on the ground. Ok now pull out phone. Now try to find headphones.” These very mundane actions helped me feel centered and not so totally freaked out. I fully expected either my roommates, the police, or EMTs to bust in my room any second. I kept thinking I was going to die, even knowing about the toxicity of LSD, and my mind kept flashing to what the last thing was I wanted to say to God to rationalize my short life. I stumbled to a notepad and started to write “mom-I love you” then crossed it out as it suddenly seemed completely random and trite. Was this really the last message I wanted to leave the world?  Instead I opted for printing in huge letters “HOLY SHIT” for some reason crossing the T at the bottom and making it look like an I. I was totally fucked up, the carpet was undulating and each object on my floor took on massive significance in what I thought to be the light of my last moments of life. Eventually I passed out on my bed for several hours when my crisis came to a pitch- I shut my eyes and tried to narrow my experience to the smallest amount of stimuli possible, focusing on my breathing. I guess this made me fall asleep because the next thing I remember was waking up around 6:00 pm, knowing the worst was over and thanking God and the spirits of the universe that I was alive and O.K. The trip was far from over, however, and the visuals were still going full force. My whitewashed walls were plastered with thousands of little amoeba shaped blobs each with numerous different bright colors contained within. I remember being stunned at the rainbows that seemed to form a halo around every object. By this time the sun had set, and turning on the lamps in my room sent cascades of crystalline light in all directions. With my totally ridiculous fear of dying past me, I was able to turn on my favorite music (A Japanese producer named Yasutaka Nakata) and enjoy the totally beautiful, ecstatic visuals that slowly died down, coming back briefly in waves until about 11 o’clock.In retrospect, I never thought I would have an acid trip I wouldn’t be able to handle. I pride myself on my experience with psychedelics and voraciously read books, websites, anything I can about them and the experience we humans have with these substances. I was unprepared for the completely rapid and alien change my world went through in less than half an hour. I am mad at myself for freaking out, I contemplated calling 911 during the worst parts, and just imagining what could have happened had I done this sends shivers down my spine. A hospital is NOT where you want to ride out an acid trip. Reading this back to myself, I think “Why couldn’t I have just calmed down and enjoyed it??” At the time, this was impossible. My trip was like a freight train that gathered and gathered speed until I did the only thing I could-became unconscious. I hope no one gets scared or chooses not to partake of LSD because of this trip report. I love lysergic acid diethylamide, it is an unbelievably wonderful sacrament that has been bestowed upon the human race, and I truly believe that a direct experience of reality, beyond labels or concepts, could push the human race off the destructive path it is currently on.

So being as adventures as I am and with just one day before the new years I decided to buy it, along with 3 hits of really good LSD. I’ve done K before this time but it was in a extreamly small dose and I felt the minor effects of it and I liked it.So I called up my friend  T and told him I had all this shit and he was down to get fucked up with me that night. So we get to T's dads house at first I honestly was not sure on how much to pour out so I poured out a little, let T snort his then I did mine, but then for some reason I just dumped the whole bag out and just said fuck it. BIG FUCKING MISTAKE. after me and T snorted the entire bag of K we both dropped one hit of LSD. A this point all I remember was me sitting on the couch next to T mumbling words and yelling WHERE THE FUCK AM I!!Now from what I remember I had the most tunnel vision I ever expirenced in my life I can relate it to moxy if u guys know what that is..( foxy moxy anyone??..heh) but anyways time felt like it last for hours and hours on end I was laying on the couch yelling random incoherent things at some of my friends, one of my best buddy's girlfriends was there baby sitting us and I was asking her to fuck like a million times, at this point my friend big T came down  to see what the fuck was going on. I was surrounded by faces, they looked stretched out out, and extreamly bubbly, everything in my world was bubbly, I had absolutely no control of my body and apparently T's father came down and I started swinging my fists at him and I was calling one of my best friends rude names, like fuck you your a dick go die in hell...shit like that. I was such a fucking wreck I had to have my friends pull my pants up because they came down some how...it was the most embarrassing thing I ever experienced I was fucked up to the maximum, my original plan was to do all of this K on new years but that would've been bad..so good thing I got it over with...how did I get home??T, the one I did this K with was driving my car while M, my friends girl was driving behind us to make sure were safe...when sitting in the car.  [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  I felt like I was in a fucking space ship..EVERYTHING was strecthed out swirling in circles.. I could see every fucking detail of the entire world  my hands looked like mickey mouse and I thought I was going to die by the end of this night because it would never end.We got to my apartment complex, my friend M helped me walk up to my door and opened it for me and I got to my house..no one was home so I went straight to bed.. I was so fucked up I just could not believe it.This was the most intense ketamine trip I’ve ever expirenced...I almost lost all of my friends, punched my friends dad in the face while his 8 year old brother was there and all in all I just lost sense of everything I ever knew...I dont think I’m going to do Ketamine for a very long time after that day....today is new years eve. 2012 is coming very shortly and I’m gonna go get drunk..

And I haven't tried it since. In the past I have been a regular pot smoker, LOVED mushrooms, done coke 3 times, crack once (and never again), and a number of different painkillers etc. I tend to be experimental but not a habitual drug user. (Other than alcohol and every now and then pot)It all starts with me getting off work at about 3 am. I headed from work over to a friends house to hang out.. We ended up drinking. Well I got pretty smashed, and drove home around 9 AM after my boyfriend called me wondering where the hell I was. (he didn't know that I was at a friends house and had expected me to be home when he woke up) When I got home I was acting pretty stupid, being drunk and all.. And they told me to just go to bed. Well I was a bit too revved up to go to sleep so I hung around the living room. Next thing I know my boyfriend told me he was going to take the acid we had bought a couple days ago...  So I said 'Me too!'He thought this was a little strange because I'm usually very hesitant and nervous about taking new drugs especially because I have really bad anxiety and tend to freak out even if I get a little too high... BUT I was intoxicated and had a 'What the heck why not' attitude. I strangely had no reservations about this... So he hesitantly said ok.. And put the tiny square on my tongue... He took one, and we also gave some to my room mate. After leaving it on there for a while I took it off and threw it away, or I may have swallowed it I cant remember. I think at this point I decided it would be a good idea to get out my art supplies and start painting. I don't really have a good perception of how long it took to kick in because it was a very slow process... I slowly became more euphoric and I was still a little drunk and now feeling a little high. I ran into my other room mates room and told him to wake up because things were so crazy and awesome cause we're tripping on acid and he's like wtf? I think around this point (after sitting around and talking and waiting) I decided that the acid just wasnt working good enough for me so I took another hit.. This time, I put it on my tongue and immediately (accidentially) swallowed it.. I realized that I wasnt really aware of my tongue. So I went back into the living room and started pouring paint all over this huge canvas. Every color I could think of... The sun was shining into the balcony window onto the painting and the colors were extraordinarily bright.. I shoved my hands into the paint and began swishing the colors around.. I felt like a child I was giggling and dancing around covered in paint.. I got my boyfriend to help me... I felt like my eyes were HUGE as I kept staring at the colors... Finally I washed my hands and my room mate who also did the acid suggested that we go buy some food. Food? Why would you have a desire to eat NOW? I was confused, but decided it might be fun to leave the house. So we went... About the time that we pulled up to the store I started tripping a little harder... The trees outside the window felt like they were trying to get me, like they were reaching into the window and grabbing at me. I told everyone that the trees were trying to kill me and they thought it was funny... So did I.... So my room mate who did acid and my room mate who I had woken up (who was driving and NOT on acid) went into the store while I sat in the car with my boyfriend. My boyfriend asked me if I was ok.. And I just remember I kept saying.'Yeah......' Really quiet and slow. I decided that I had to get out of the car now.... So my boyfriend came around and helped me get out of the car.. Standing was strange.. So was walking.. It was like I was floating and sinking into the ground at the same time. We started walking around the building.. I can't tell you how many times we walked in circles around this building... I was very quiet.. I was somewhere else.. I couldn't speak. It had also begun to rain. (it had turned into a very cold and dreary day and then begun to rain) about the 3rd time we circled to building (and the people in the movie store started looking at us weird) We came around to the back side where there were two dumpsters. I stopped dead in my tracks ..I felt like I was standing there horrified and gawking at the ground.. There was a river of red water coming out from underneath these dumpsters... OMG... Something is dead in there... I couldnt stop thinking.. I imagined there was a dead person.. Or maybe animals dead inside this dumpster and the rain was washing the blood out of it and into the drain below... My boyfriend interruped the thoughts after I stood there for a minute and he was like ... 'you OK?' I said  'yeah.... 'I told him what I was thinking and he told me it was just the rust from the metal washing off in the water.. (does that actually happen?) So by the time we are back to the car I've decided im full blown tripping.. I cant speak anymore, I'm so very far away and everything is very strange... Life is so strange... I'm distant and confused. We're driving along and as I'm looking into the sky I see these intense visuals.. These kaliedascopes of colors swirling and dancing and pusling.. I shout 'OMG, They're real! Its true!' My roomate asks me what is real, I tell him about the designs im seeing and he said yeah, where else did you think they came from? I thought that people were just making those psychadelic pictures up... That it was just their was of interpreting their feelings... But anyway... We get home and when I get out of the car I feel like I sink into the ground.. I can't wait for a minute.. Suddenly I feel so very small.. I feel small and as I continue walking I get bigger and bigger (I may have actually been walking crouched over and slowly standing up, I couldn't tell if it was the acid or me) Finally im back to normal size.. We head up to the apartment and I go inside.. I don't eat the sandwich they got me I just lay on my bed.. So does my boyfriend... We aren't talking.. He keeps asking me if I'm ok... Which freaks me out because I think 'do I look like im not ok?' and he said he was just worried about me.. At some point I looked into the mirror and became extremely interested in my eyes.. One pupil so much larger than the other... I asked everyone if they really were two different sizes or if I was just seeing things.. They were tripping too so I couldnt get a straight answer.. While looking in the mirror I discover a sore on the inside of my lip. I ask my boyfriend what it is.. He said its probably just some kind of ulcer... I ask him what causes that and he tells me bacteria... Then, when he says the word 'Bacteria' I get this halarious visual.. Of a little man (and some buddues) in a green sweater and cap sliding down my tongue and in a high pitched voice shouting 'Bacteria!' So I get really creeped out and start brushing my teeth to get rid of the 'Bacteria' As im brushing my teeth im imagining the little green men being squished under neath my tooth brush.. It bothers me a little bit but I keep brushing because the idea of little fat men in sweaters inside my mouth creeps me out even more... The rest of the night is a blur... But this is were a lot of the worst stuff happens. It goes from being slightly strange but interesting... To downright unbearable. After taking a beautiful walk outside in the rain and picking up some amazingly colored fall leaves on the path I come back inside and lay down. I spent the next 6-8 hours laying in my bed.. Periodically, me and my boyfriend got into the shower in order to feel more comfortable.. I couldn't sleep... My entire body felt like it was dying (possibly some sort of hangover effects being made worse by coming down off acid) My room began to feel like a prision.. I started having this seriously overwhelming fear of being an inanimate object. I tried to stop myself from thinking it... I didn't want to go that far away... Images flashed in my head but they didn't make any sense... My entire brain was jumped up. I laid in bed, unable to sleep, feeling as if my brain was a circuit board and someone was systematically unplugging input cords and shoving them carelessly into the wrong holes.. Every time something was put back the wrong way I'd feel like that hole would then become fried and unusable.. I was horrified...My brain was being rewired and wired again.. Over and over and over and over and over... Time was lasting forever, I thought I would never be the same again. As I was laying there staring at the ceiling (but not looking at the ceiling) I felt as if my body parts were being taken off and then put back on the wrong way, like my legs and arms were laying at odd angles, twitching and working incorrectly. Every time these thoughts became unbearable and I thought I might freak out I went into the shower and sat there for a while.. We must have taken like 6 showers that night. About 12 hours into the trip I was done with it, I wanted it to be over so bad... But it was like a strange and horrifying show that I was being forced to watch over and over again that made less and less sense every time. I had this terrible fear that the acid was destroying my brain, that it was re-wiring my brain the wrong way and that I may never be normal again.. Nothing felt right anymore. I felt alone, god didn't exsist... I was a cold and useless robot or computer progam that had just been struck with lightening and fried, or had just contracted some kind of trojan virus... I felt a lot of remorse. I started taking sleeping pills.. I just wanted to go to sleep. 16 hours after my first hit (and 26 hours since I had last slept) I finally fell asleep... Leaving being the cold icy stare of my bedroom and the items within it... I woke up the next day and my anxiety was pretty terrible.. I still felt like I wasn't the same.. Like something still wasn't right... It took me about 3 days to feel slightly normal again... But until this day I know that something changed in my brain that night... And I don't know what it is.. But it was something that was perfectly fine before.. And now its slightly wrong... I wish I could explain it... Every now and then for no reason.. (I know there is a trigger but im not sure what it is) I will just stop and zone out for a second and that feeling returns... Almost like my brain skipping a beat or a glitch... And I just don't feel right... But I can usually come back from it... I just feel like something is missing... *sigh*I don't know if I'll ever do acid again.. I have strong feelings about doing man made drugs.. I prefer all natural drugs, un-tampered with. I feel like acid was made to rewire or even destroy the human mind. (and not rewire for the better) Perhaps its in the eye of the beholder but I lost something about myself that night... Im not sure what it is, but I'd give up the trip experience to have it back. One good thing that happened after the trip... I wasnt able to have a single cigarette during my trip AND after my trip.. It took my almost a week to get over the repulsion I had when thinking about cigarettes.. On my trip I thought they were super disgusting and that if I smoked one, I'd puke... So prehaps the drug has the ability to help with quitting smoking?  But my only suggestion is that people be careful about their surroundings while tripping.. Whatever you see/hear/experience on acid is more likely to get stamped on your mind. I listened to a music video by Cradle of Filth (I dont usually listen to that kind of music) while at my peak of tripping and I swear to god the song kept playing in my head over and over again for the remainder of the trip.. And that must have been well over 5 hours of 'nymphetamine' playing in my head... It became torture.. Even though I kind of like the song...Exp Year: 2008ExpID: 83138Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 22 Published: Nov 9, 2012Views: 24,619    LSD (2) : General (1), First Times (2), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Nature / Outdoors (23), Music Discussion (22), Guides / Sitters (39), Hangover / Days After (46), Post Trip Problems (8), Various (28) DOSE: T+ 0:003 hitssmokedLSD(powder / crystals)  T+ 3:003 hitssmokedDMT(powder / crystals)BODY WEIGHT:125 lbI've never experienced anything remotely close to the intensity of this combination.  I rarely detail experiences I've had because words simply don't do them justice, but this is an exception because I feel it is something I need to share.  Of course, the more incredibly intense it gets, the harder it gets to explain.  Nevertheless, I'll at least make an attempt.Lately I've been having weekly tripping sessions with a group of 4 friends.  I introduced all of them to LSD, and we've been having some incredible experiences together.  I absolutely love this drug.  I've introduced DMT to three of them, and I've had mixed responses.  They all had trouble smoking the stuff (as I use an oil burner pipe), but one of them didn't feel it very much at all, another had a pleasant mild trip, and the third had an extremely unpleasant experience (though she only took one hit, so it wasn't too difficult to handle).  I decided to try my hand at smoking DMT on LSD the other weekend, and took two hits of it and had an incredible time.  It wasn't a breakthrough by any means, but it was a pleasant intensifying of the LSD visuals that blew me out of the water at the time.  It was good stuff, and I wanted to emulate that experience this weekend.So this time I went for three hits of LSD, as we've all been gradually stepping up our dosage.  It was an incredible day, and we dosed about 9:30am.  We spent the first few hours of the experience indoors handling the peak, listening to music, watching Milkdrop, etc.  Then we went outside, and explored the creek near one of their houses that we were staying at.  It got cold, and we decided to head back inside, and I wanted to smoke DMT again.  My friend said he was down, and the other two decided not to.  We sit down and put on the Grateful Dead.  So he takes two medium sized hits, and lays back and starts to have a good time.  I was relieved because of the bad experience our other friend had, so I felt confident in doing it this time.  We had started a stopwatch on one of our phones to keep track of how long we held the hits.  I had switched it on when my friend started taking his hits, and so I started taking mine probably 3-5 minutes after it had started.So I took a small hit, held for thirty seconds as always, and let it out.  Then I lit up another, slightly bigger hit, and repeated.  When the third hit came around, and I started inhaling, the bulb of the pipe completely fogged up with the vapor.  I don't think I had ever taken a hit that big before.  But I took it, held it in, and that's when things got real.  I have no recollection of letting that hit out.  In fact, as any of you who have experienced a breakthrough dose of DMT should know,  much of the experience was blacked out.The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground on my stomach.  I didn't know where I was, what was happening, why it was happening, what time it was, or who I was.  I struggled to get a hold of reality.  I opened my eyes wide and couldn't see a single thing at some points.  The world was replaced with a horrid nightmarish world.  When I could get glimpses of what was around me, the room was a huge swirl, like a blender.  Stuff was EVERYWHERE.  All of the things we had on the floor were scattered everywhere, and there were dozens of each object.  I saw so many copies of my cell phone and the oil burner pipe, and jars and clothes and all sorts of things.  Nothing made any sense.  I pulled my hand out from under me, and the pipe was clenched in it.  As I was looking at it, it completely vanished and reappeared on the ground next to me.  I was dizzy and completely delusional.  I kept thinking 'what time is it?' and 'what's happening to me?', but most importantly, 'am I hurt?  am I okay?  am I dying?'.  I looked up to see my friend kneeling by me trying to talk to me in a calming voice, but I couldn't understand him.  Not a word he was saying.  It was complete gibberish.  All the while these thoughts were swarming my head, and I struggled to ask him if I was hurt, but I couldn't articulate the thought into words.  I kept thinking 'I have to ask him if I'm okay.  Ask him!', but I couldn't speak.  I just looked back up at him when he was speaking nonsense, and shook my head and curled back up into a ball.  I had to just lay down and recede into myself.  I had no choice.I faded in and out of consciousness several times.  My life was flashing right before my eyes.  It was like a blurred tunnel of visions that came to me from my past.  It felt like I zoomed through my entire life in a flash, going over everything that happened to me.  It got to that day, and the day's events flashed through my mind.  I made a tremendous effort to figure out at what point my memory stopped.  I remember being at the creek, jumping on rocks (which I'm hugely fond of doing on LSD), and climbing on the rickety maintenance bridge we found.  Had I fallen off?  That was the only possibility I could think of.  I must have fallen and hit my head, and had been rushed to the ER.I pulled my head up and looked around the room.  It wasn't the room I started in.  It was somewhere else.  It looked huge and tiny at the same time, pulsating.  It looked nothing like the room we were in.  I looked around and saw that all three of my friends weren't in there with me.  The police!  The police must have come and found out what happened.  We were busted.  It was all over.  My life was ruined.  I figured my friends were in the other room talking to an officer and explaining that I was on DMT, and they were waiting for me to become sane again.  The dread of that combined with the feelings of sheer terror I had felt already, and I was losing it.  I saw everything important to me before me demolished and destroyed.  If I wasn't dying already (and the thought had occurred to me several times; there were times when I thought this was the only explanation), my life may as well have been over.  Everything and everyone I cared about vanished before my eyes, destroyed.  I had become insane.  Lost my mind.  Even if I survived this hellish nightmare, I would never be sane again.  I would never be happy again.  I managed to look up, and saw that my friend was back in the room and sitting on the couch.  The window was behind him, and the light shining in obscured his face.  He looked divine, but it was no comfort to me.  I rolled back over and fell into it again.I came back to and pulled myself up and flopped onto the couch.  I faded in and out of reality as all these thoughts of dread and loss flooded my mind and broke me.  I've had a few bad trips on mushrooms, but they don't compare to this.  Not even close.  I was convinced I would never feel happiness, which has happened to me on a horrible mushroom trip before.  Then the thought hit me as I started to realize what was happening.  The concept of a bad trip came back to me, and I remembered I had smoked DMT, and things began to make a little more sense.  I was completely delusional, though.  Intellectually, I knew that this would all be over soon, and I knew I had to remind myself of this, but the negative feelings overcame all rationality, and I became extremely depressed.  The door opened and my friend came back in and sat on the chair next to me.  He asked me if I wanted some water, and I weakly nodded and he handed me the bottle I had brought and I carefully cracked open the cap and took a sip.  I just then realized how much my throat and mouth burned.  The water helped, even though it gave me a bit of a coughing fit.  I started burping quite a bit, and my friend said 'you're not gonna throw up on me, are you?'.  I sort of chuckled and said no.  My head nodded back over and I closed my eyes.  Things were still horrifying, but reality was slowly starting to fade back in.I remembered that the only way out of this nightmare was to let go.  It took more effort than I'd care to admit to just lay back still and ride it out.  All the while I was muttering things like 'holy shit...fuck... that was bad... really bad... really bad idea... why did I do that?  Oh my God...'.  But at least now I could understand English again, and could begin to communicate.  I had pieced everything back together and began to understand what had happened to me, but the feelings still remained and I was weak, broken, and destroyed.  Our other two friends came back in, and one asked if I was okay, and I told her yes, yes, I'll be fine, just give me another minute.  Then I remembered the time.  What time was it?  I had to know.  I had to know how long I was out for.  I asked my friend, and he didn't know.  I remember in the haze and confusion I looked at my phone and saw that it was 4:03.  Now, I looked at it, and it was 4:23.  I didn't put that together, and it was meaningless.  Just numbers.  Nonsense.  I slipped back into the couch with my eyes clothes, whimpering and grunting a little bit.At some point, I got up and went to the bathroom.  The concept of time didn't mean anything to me, and the memory of it is jumbled and segmented.  I finished the bottle of water when I came back, and laid back to relax and let the rest of it dissipate.  The other two had gone back into the other room and it was just me and my friend who had stuck with me.  He sat next to me and I was on the verge of sobbing.  I started to talk to him in a soft, weak voice, and I kept repeating that that was a bad idea.  That was a horrible idea.  How could I have been so careless?  I started to explain to him a little bit of what had happened, though it was still a mess in my mind.  He told me when I was on the floor and he was trying to talk to me, I stared at him with eyes wide open and a blank face, and that my pupils were completely dilated.  I'm the only one of the four of us that doesn't have dark brown eyes, and he said that there was absolutely no color in them.  I was apparently shaking rolling about a bit.  He said he brought the other two out of the room so that things would calm down a bit.  Everything was fine.  Nothing was broken, the police hadn't come, and I was beginning to grasp reality again.  I was going to be okay.He also said that there was one song that came on right as I started to fall into the bad trip.  I had put on 'The Best of Skeletons From the Closet', a best-of album by the Grateful Dead, and the song that came on was called Rosemary.  That song scares the shit out of me sober for some reason, and it made sense that that song triggered that negativity.  It very well could have been the cause of all this.  Our other friends came back in the room, and one of them found the phone with the timer.  It was still running.  This was at the point when I was just starting to come out of it, and it read 50 minutes.  Fifty minutes!  I was out for probably about forty-five minutes.  In the heat of the experience, I thought it would all be over in 10.  In all honesty, I would have guessed I was gone for days.  Literally, days.  It felt like years.  Anybody who's experienced a breakthrough knows that feeling.Without a doubt, this experience was the most terrifying and traumatizing experience of my entire life.  I feel like this sort of experience is the worst thing a human being can go through and come out okay from.  It was truly humbling, and has inspired a higher respect for these drugs.  That's not to say I didn't have a respect for them already, but I'm surely going to tread with more caution in the future.  It'll be a while before I combine these two drugs again, but I don't think I'll ever break through on DMT while on LSD again.  I can't imagine a worse thing.One post on the internet caught my eye upon rereading it:'This combo will caused me to completely lose all control and any sense of self I still had left after taking LSD. The boundaries that separate my body from my surroundings dissolved and I mesh with the ever morphing energy surrounding me.The DMT flash that followed was shocking and impossible. Since I was high on LSD I didn't comedown like I do when smoking DMT sober but remained in the dream for a significant amount of time. A lot happened but it wasn't human. After a while I wasn't functioning as a human anymore. When I finally regained control the DMT afterglow and the LSD combined to give the feeling of surviving an extremely death defying experience. I was in a state of shock for a good while. I personally love this combo but I have seen it break people before so think deeply about whether you want to subject your mind to something so shattering and foreign.'I should have heeded this warning.  This describes how I felt exactly.Thanks for reading if you made it all the way through.  I'll definitely never forget this experience and the lesson I learned from it.  I think we all start to feel invincible at some point in our psychedelic careers.  I'm just glad I pushed the limits in a safe environment rather than somewhere where I could have hurt myself or others.Exp Year: 2012ExpID: 94874Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 12, 2012Views: 31,548    LSD (2), DMT (18) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:  oralCacti - columnar(tea) 2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab) 1.5 goralMushrooms - P. cubensis(dried)BODY WEIGHT:78 kgThis was written a couple of days after the experience. It is now over a year since this experience and I still think about it every single day. I will never forget it and it remains one of the most incredible things that I have ever experienced. Before I really start writing I will say that it is currently 2 days after my trip and I still do not feel 100% normal. I have never had a 'bad trip' before and in my opinion I still do not believe that my trip ended out 100% bad. Sure, it was the most I've ever freaked out and panicked but deep down I could see it happening I'm pretty sure. It needed to happen, and in time ill be glad it happened.Well the biggest weekend of my life started early Friday morning with little sleep the night before. I was planning to go to a festival with a friend, obviously bringing drugs with us. (Never again.) As the whole day drags on while we get stuff ready, we are finally ready to leave at about 5:30pm. The festival is a fair drive away, maybe 2 hoursish. Off we go...I have heard a lot about these festivals and how they are very underground, in the middle of nowhere & rarely have any police around. As we were almost getting to the site of the festival we were stopped by a whole bunch of police doing breathalyzer & drug tests. Once we got past them we were pretty relieved; we thought that this was going to be it. Fuck we thought wrong. After about another 1km or so down the road, we see another big road block of police. My friends mum immediately gave consent to search the car. Fuck. Well, all our drugs got taken. We got arrested, taken to the station, interviewed and let go. I have a bullshit psilocybin mushroom charge to fight and a cannabis caution. Once we were back in the car, I am told that we are heading back home to Melbourne. At this stage I am so tired, stressed, delirious...feeling generally horrible. With no drugs. And plans for the weekend absolutely fucking destroyed. In fairness to the cops, they didn't take a few of my things which they couldn't prove weren't legal smoking blends so they forgot about them.Well we try to forget about things and when we get home we smoke lots of ganja. I'm talking about 1.5grams that night. That's a lot of weed for me. We keep smoking bong after bong the whole night, and I get to sleep at about 5am I think. I can't even remember. Anyway, I slept till about 11:30am, got up, smoked some cones and then decided I feel like shit still and went back to bed for a few hours.After getting up later on in the arvo, I had a little bit of food to eat, smoked some more cones and before I knew it it was pretty much night time. I decided that I'm not going to let anything ruin my weekend. Nothing at all. So I went and picked up 2 tabs of acid and a little bit of weed & headed back home. Smoked some more and I thought I was feeling not too bad, so I invited another friend over who is very very experienced with psychedelics and I thought that with him around I would be fine no matter what & in the end this turned out to be true.Once he gets around we all decide to get together some San Pedro tea, mushrooms & a bit of acid for the night. We start chugging San Pedro tea at my place for a little bit and then start heading down to the park. Once we are down there we find little firewood and struggle to get a fire going. I'm starting to feel the San Pedro by now, and I've been on an empty stomach all day. My first time tripper friend wasn't feeling too high from it but he was feeling a bit sick and had thrown up a few times.It's now a good hour or so after drinking the San Pedro and I felt it building quite nicely so I decided to eat 2 tabs of decent acid. Still feeling not too bad I decided to eat a small amount - probably 1-1.5g - of dried cubensis. Once these are washed down me and my experienced friend decide to go on a journey to the servo to get wood.We leave my inexperienced friend who at this stage was a little sick but not very high at the park by himself for 15 minutes while we go and get some wood. I notice that I am coming up very very hard but nothing that I didn't think I could handle at this stage. Once we grab the wood and start carrying it back to the park. We get back to our spot with things all over the place, a pile of vomit, and a half empty bottle of San Pedro tea sitting there, but my friend was not there.Whilst still coming up fear and panic started to build. We walked around looking for my friend whose phone was off and unable to be contacted. We walk around shouting out his name, unable to find him at all. We decide to sit at the fire, try and start it and just all round try and chill out for a little bit. With me still coming up hard, worrying the fact we had no fire, getting increasingly scared and cold...it was bad. I call up my brother to let me know if my friend turns up at my place. This was getting worse and worse...Now I have never had a 'bad trip' on anything, let alone LSD/mescaline/mushrooms all together before. I had no idea what it would feel like...absolutely no idea. Well after a bit of time I finally got a phone call from my brother, telling me that my friend was now back at my place and safe. I should've felt better now knowing this but I think the damage was already done. My fate was made. I bent down to try and get the fire going but I was unable to do a lot. I was shaking like crazy. I stopped what I was doing, and sat there, breathing very fast, and shivering profusely. I tried to take my mind off things. I tried to stand up and screw around with the fire again.After failing dismally, I sat down again, still breathing hard and shivering. My friend now asked me if I was OK, and I said 'I don't think so man.' He asked me if I wanted to go home but I said I was OK for now. I kept talking to my friend and he kept reassuring me I was OK and everything was fine. As my condition was increasingly getting worse, my friend was starting to get concerned so he put on some music first and then started talking to me about his bad trip and how he felt at the time. According to him, I was in a very similar state at the time. He asked me how it felt and I said I wasn't sure. He then asked me if it was powerful and I said 'YES! It's more powerful than anything else! Powerful!' At this time I was crying and spluttering and whimpering and laughing and screaming, all at the same time. It was incredible.I was in too much of a state to really be away from home, so I said/cried/screamed/whimpered 'I THINK I WANNA GO HOME MAN! I WANNA GO HOMMEEEEE!' I felt really horrible and guilty and I was saying how sorry I was to my friend for ruining his trip and he kept saying it was OK and he has had to do similar things before and I should just try and keep my mind off things and keep talking and walking. I quickly gathered my things and began the long walk home. It was dark, cold, and I was started to get very wet. While I was walking through a densely forested area, I got very very scared and I was constantly stopping and whimpering...constantly. I then realized about now that this was the most intense spiritual and emotional moment of my life. This wasn't just some scary horrible thing anymore, it was POWERFUL. INTENSE. MAGICAL. CRAAZY. INSANE. ENLIGHTENING. EVERYTHING. The fight-or-flight response of panic and fear is almost exhilarating. I have never felt anything like that in my life.My friend while still talking, and making sure I was OK, asked me how I was & exactly how I felt. I said 'I'm...not...sureee!' He then asked me to look at him and say the words 'I-AM-O-K!' I kept doing so and it made me feel better. He then told me about how when he was having his bad trip and that how you will never feel this exact feeling ever again and to think about how many people ever get to feel this feeling. And I clearly remember him saying 'LSD is the most incredible thing in the universe.' it hit me so hard. The realization of what I was feeling. At the given time. All at once. I broke down just crying saying 'OH MY GOD! OH MY FUCKING GOD! YOU ARE SO RIGHT! FREEDOM OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND NOBODY CAN EXTRACT EXPERIENCE FROM MY BRAIN AND NOBODY CAN TAKE THIS FEELING AWAY FROM ME!' It was a powerful moment. Very personal and spiritual.Wow. What I was feeling was so incredible. I felt like this was a step forward in my life. This was now and the beginning of tomorrow not before today. But now & after now. I couldn't fathom it! This was impossible! I was feeling things that are not possible to feel! Once we got out of the park and around houses, I was still crying and whimpering. Because I was around houses I had to muffle the noises I was making. Constantly crying and whimpering. When would this leave me? I couldn't handle much more of it. I was so glad when we got back to my place. I opened the door, went upstairs, collapsed on the bathroom floor, and started rolling around, in a state of complete egolessness. Totally unaware of what I was feeling. My mood was constantly changing. From despair to happiness, from catatonia to bliss, from anxiety to sadness, from complete terror to warmth and peace. This would change as constantly as every 15 seconds, sometimes taking about 15 minutes to change.I went downstairs, and just sat on the floor in front of the TV. The noise was horrible! I demanded it be turned off. I couldn't take it. Sitting on the floor, rocking back and forth in the fetal position was truly horrible. Constantly with a changed mood. People talking to me meant nothing. I was getting paranoid. I thought they were using me. I had no idea what sort of shit they had me doing for them at the time. They would deliberately tell jokes and I wasn't sure whether to believe it for a second. Then a few seconds later I'd burst into a fit of laughter after realizing they were joking.Then BANG! It would happen again... FEAR! TERROR! INSANITY! CATATONIA! FEAR! HAPPINESS! EUPHORIA! INTENSE WONDER! ANXIETY! PARANOIA! The constantly changing moods were fucking so horrible but they were gradually wearing off. Every single day we take our sanity for granted. Trust me. Being crazily insane and stuck in a crazy constantly changing loop for 5-6 hours was not fun.In time, the loops were calming down and they kept becoming less and less intense. But sitting down on the floor saying to my friend 'oh shit... It's gonna happen again now isn't it?' then he'd say 'aaaaaany minute now.' then I'd get up and start walking around, talking to myself and going crazy and screaming, laughing, crying. Then I'd go and sit down again and feel OK. Then I'd ask if it was going to happen again soon. Then it would go on, and on, and on, and on, and on. I think I would've had at least 20-30 intense loops, with about another 100+ or so that happened in my head which weren't evident to those around me.I went outside and decided to smoke a few cones, and that made me feel alright. I was still peaking hard. The loops didn't seem to get any worse so I sat outside for a bit and just chilled out and kept smoking. After a bit I went inside and I was able to concentrate on the TV a little bit better now and the loops weren't as bad. As it got later and later I realized the sun was going to be coming up soon. So I thought a walk was in order.I walked back down to the park across the big oval I walked across the night before. There was a very thick fog over the oval, and the grass was COVERED in dew. Soon enough, over the horizon, the sun rose. It was directly in front of me, a massive burning ball of light, heat & energy. I could feel its warmth immediately. And I could feel this 'roaring' and 'glowing' feeling inside me. I then bent down and touched the dew in the grass, and almost before I'd even touched it it just disintegrated into nothing and the little patch of dew I touched had disappeared. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever experienced in my whole life. Everything that I had ever perceived flashed past my eyes and the most intense feeling I felt at the time was love! Love is the most powerful feeling there is, and I am sure of this now. I just broke down crying again. I was there, at that exact time, experiencing something so fucking amazing and unique and beautiful. This was the most beautiful moment of the whole trip, and the most beautiful feeling I've ever felt in my whole life. At the time I started to feel a real conclusive feeling like the trip was talking to me. It kinda said 'it's over now, so you make the most of it. I'm leaving now. May the light I've produced for you and the things I've showed you be understood and used to push yourself as far as you want to during your time on this planet.'As I got up and kept walking towards the sun in complete euphoria and happiness and spirituality, I felt like I was healed. All the tears I expelled from my body were like purging. All the poison was gone and expelled from my body and I was running on the power & spirit of love. I felt healed. After a little while I eventually walked back home, drank some water, ate some fruit, let my friends go home and then I finally went to sleep at about 1 p..m, about 17 hours after ingestion. I was still feeling too high to sleep but my body just switched itself off. After I got up later that day at about 6 pm I still felt not normal. At 10 pm the next time I smoked some weed and noticed mild LSD/mescaline-like visuals, more than 24hours after ingestion. Wow.All in all, I think that the initial freak out was the mushrooms that pushed me over the edge, it was the acid that caused the insane delusions and thought & it was the powerfully energetic visuals from the mescaline which made the edginess of the acid even worse. I think I felt a strong happy peaceful healed sort of feeling while walking along the grass which I attribute to mescaline. What an intense nightmare. But intense nightmares get you a lot further than any other plain old happy giggly walk in the park.I think I will be taking some time off psychedelics and generally trying to get myself back together. In time I will dose again, because I feel like I owe so fucking much to these extremely wonderful unique chemicals and what they are capable of doing.If it ever happens to me again, I'll think about how amazing and unique and exhilarating it feels. Go with it! And let it do what it wants to do. Whatever doesn't kill me, will only make me stronger. If it's scary and bad it's like that for a reason! Psychedelics make me think & feel the way I should be thinking and feeling at the time. They are all keys that are capable of opening doors that will push life in the right direction. I needed to realize that not everything in life is meant to be fun or enjoyable. Some beneficial things aren't necessarily going to be fun.Peace, love, happiness & contemptness to all! I love each and every one of you! We are 6 billion different personalities all thriving off cosmic energy that we all individually create! Whenever you love someone or do something good, beautiful or amazing to yourself or someone else, you will add to that energy and make it available for someone else to feel. Pass on the love and light to everyone you see and everyone you ever meet!Exp Year: 2010ExpID: 92907Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 20 Published: Nov 16, 2012Views: 14,367    Mushrooms - P. cubensis (66), LSD (2), Cacti - columnar (10) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3), General (1) DOSE:3 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:58 kgBefore this trip, I had had a lot of previous experience with other psychedelics, especially acid, and had taken it on approximately 20 other occasions, the most I have ever taken at once being 7 (After over a month of not taking it, so my tolerance level would have been zero), and on none of these occasions had I ever had a bad trip; I had never reached a state where I was oblivious to the outside world, i.e. where all I could see were my hallucinations, I had not had one single bad experience. And at the time of the trip I'm going to describe, I had not regretted a single acid trip I had taken. So I decided to take 3 hits, approximately µg 260 on each tab, [Erowid Note: Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be done casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements were derived, it is reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.]   ignoring the very VERY important fact that I was coming off Escitalopram (SSRI), 20 mg daily, which I had been on for about a year, and had stopped taking them instantly without progressively lowering the dose, so I had been experiencing EXTREMELY severe paresthesia to the point of paralysis and black outs, constant light-headedness, headache, dizziness, insomnia, cold sweats- I was about a week into coming off it. Yes. I was an idiot to take acid at this point of SSRI withdrawal.  This is everything that I can remember: T+ 0.00 I took all three tabs at once, my friend (let’s call him T) taking two, and T’s girlfriend S taking one. I was at one of my closest friend’s house, a place where I feel completely safe and calm, with some of my best friends, 5 people in total including T and S, but my friend’s parents were in… And most importantly, my girlfriend and love of my life, wasn’t with me that night. I chew the tabs to death, then swallow, and lie down on my friend’s bed to smoke a big joint and wait for the drugs to take hold.T+ 0.45 I’m laughing hysterically and am extremely excitable and jittery. Very confused but in a good way, enjoying every second of it. Smoking high grade, really enjoying my Beatles/ Pink Floyd/ Bowie playlist…T+ 1.00- Here we go, I’m seeing shit. Walls breathing, objects melting, creeping, shifting. Just lying there and enjoying the hallucinations and making loads of jokes, not really able to string a sentence together. Time passes. Don’t ask me how much. I’m gonna say two hours but who knows.T+3.00- My friend T is tripping pretty damn hard and says he wants to get out of my friends hotboxed basement flat and get some fresh air and “go buy a can of coke” at around midnight. So, being on acid, I’m extremely suggestible, and I agree to go with him. Of course, no shops are open, but we go for a walk around the block anyway. Back on my friend’s road, there’s some drunk guy getting beaten up by these two guys… looks like they’re robbing him. I make T aware of what’s happening, and, for a second there’s a look of panic on his face. That look of panic triggers something in me and I sprint to my friend’s door, and ring his bell over and over again. He lets me and T back in. But the buzzer disturbed his parents. They see us. They know we’re on acid. I go back into my friend’s room and am blithering and panicking away, shouting at him “No-one can understand me except for T, and I can’t understand anyone except for T”, and I genuinely couldn’t understand a word anyone said. I just heard their voices… So I decided to sit down and smoke some more weed for about half an hour…T+4.00-	There are sirens that get closer and closer and eventually stop right outside. I realise now that must have been an ambulance for that drunk dude earlier… but at the time I was convinced we were gonna get busted and so I gathered all the drugs in the room (of which there were many) and forced S (on her first trip) to stash them all in her bra. I then took all my possessions (Phone, iPod, wallet, house keys etc…) and put them down on the bed stating “I don’t want to have anything on me anyone can rob me for.” I’m panicking, I’ve started talking too loudly, shouting and screaming basically. The hallucinations are very intense; everything is moving, crawling, breathing… auditory too… music sounds like its coming out of strange places… strange noises everywhere. But we’re making too much noise and have been here far too long, so we decide to take to the streets, T, S and I. This is when I think I went into my bad trip, because before leaving my friend’s flat, I started having very bad “electric zaps” (paresthesia) that paralyzed my body and speech, and from now on I slip in and out of moments of lucidity, but mostly am stuck behind my hallucinations, seeing nothing but the horrifying imaginings of my mind. T+4.10- The friend whose flat I was at turned to me and grabbed my face and said “Listen to me, the world’s about to end. But it has to happen several times. Do you understand?” I said “What? Ok. Ok.  What do I have to do?” “Just ride it out. It has to happen. It’s going to be hard, but it needs to happen sooner or later, and it happens to be now.” I then start screaming to my friends “It’s all me! It’s all me!” over and over again and laughing hysterically. They say “Yeah man. It’s in your head. It’s all you.” I then run out of the flat, and have another episode of brain spasms and palpitations. Then I pull myself off the floor and the sky above me is on fire. I don’t see a moon. I don’t see any stars. Just fire, everywhere, that spreads down the houses and onto the streets and I can see in the distance a wall of flames getting closer and closer. Then for some reason I start screaming and shouting, a nonsensical jumble of random swear words and cries. I turn back and run to my friend’s door, ringing the bell over and over. He answers, and I run inside to his bedroom. Then his girlfriend grabs me and says “OK, just stay calm. You’re doing well. Just keep going.” I then leave the flat again and S and T follow behind. I then see myself, S, and T walking down the street from an external viewpoint. When we reach the corner at the end of the road, a man throws me to the floor and shoots me in the head. Then I realise I’m walking down the street about to come to the corner.  I turn to my friends and shout “Listen to me. I’m about to die. There’s nothing we can do but, I’m about to die ok?” They responded with “Shut up man, no-one’s gonna die” and things like that. I then ran back to the flat again and was ringing the bell a hundred times and my friend’s mother answered the door and I grabbed her face shouting “I’m going to die. I have to go. Help me, I’m going to die.” She then grabbed my face and said “You have to do it again. Go back outside.” T+ 4.30- When I left my friend’s house again I saw rows and rows of cars stretching out as far as I could see, and hundreds of people standing by the side of their cars, facing upwards with their hands up to the sky, waiting to be killed by the huge ball of flames that was engulfing the road, London, and the rest of the world. I then had some kind of a flashback and I was on a rooftop in Brooklyn where I had been tripping about a year before, and I was talking with T about death. I then realised that this trip was occurring at the same point in time as the trip on that rooftop nearly a year earlier, and that all events in my life have occurred simultaneously, and it is only my brain that created the illusion of time to help me process things (Read Slaughterhouse five by Kurt Vonnegut for more on this). Still on the rooftop from a year before, I realised that my friend T had actually jumped off the roof while tripping and fallen the 30 stories below to his death.  His girlfriend S had later killed herself too, and I realised that the last 8-12 months of my life had all been a hallucination. I then realised that I was also dead, whether or not I had actually died at that point in time, and started laughing at the fact that I had ever been trying to avoid something that had already happened.T+5.30-	I’m back on the streets of London with T and S, and I see from afar, all the people who are standing by their cars whispering to each other, one by one, from all the way at the bottom of the road, creating multiple chains of whispers getting closer to S, T and me. Whenever someone was whispered to, they would become completely enlightened and smiles would return to their faces and they would sit down and stop worrying about their deaths and just wait for it to happen. There are fireworks shooting into the sky everywhere and the flames are still there. I see the chains of whispers getting closer and closer from various different roads and then I realise that they are all going to meet simultaneously at one spot in the crossroads- where I am standing. So I will be the last one to be whispered to. I then see all of my friends who were still back at my friend’s flat, and they’re all standing talking to me, saying “It really is all you, man. It really is all you.” I then realised that I was the only person who could prevent the apocalypse, and I had to give every ounce of strength and love within me into fighting against the world ending.  S whispers to T, and then T grabs me with a massive grin on his face and is about to shout something but then suddenly there’s a guy in the road who runs up to me and shoots me in the head. I fall to the floor, watching my brains and blood pour out onto the pavement next to me. I’m lying there, and I realise I’m about to die, and then T turns to me and says “You know what death is man? Imagine the best orgasm you’ve ever had, times it by a million, and you’re still nowhere near.” I then experienced basically exactly what he described. I felt an immense rush of euphoria/ nostalgia/ understanding/ enlightenment… fuck knows what. It was incredible. At this point I “come to”, in other words become lucid, as in back in the real world, for just a few minutes. I open my eyes and see a tree on the side of the street above me and the leaves are crawling and seeping everywhere.  I’m sprawled out on the floor of the street and there’s a cigarette between my fingers, just lit. I smoke it and turn to T and say “That’s all life is man. It’s just a fucking cigarette. You fire it up, smoke it down to the butt, then stub it out and flick it down the drain.” I then started laughing hysterically and went back into my trip, I was gone again.T+7.00-	T turned to me and shouted “Only joking! Death is actually the best acid trip you’ve ever had, multiplied by a million.” However then I realised I was at the point of death, the world was coming to an end, and everything was over. My vision was gradually getting darker from the edges of my eyes inwards, and I was slowly losing sight and slipping away, I was about to die. I started crying and whimpering and I realised the only hope I had was love. So I started screaming my girlfriend’s name over and over again, and shouting out things like “I believe in the power of good”, as well as “Love! Love!” again and again, and at first, my vision came back the louder I shouted, and although it was virtually impossible to muster the strength to shout out loud after having been shot in the face, whenever I did, I felt myself regaining a little bit of life. But it was no use and after a few minutes everything went black.T+8.00- 	It’s the eve of the millennium and I’m in the back of the car with my dad driving, and the time on the clock reads 23:59. My dad is looking at me in the dashboard mirror with a slight smile on his face, wearing a very calm and sober expression.I say “Is (my girlfriend) ok?”Yes. She’s at home, asleep.And her mother and father?Yes. They’re fine.And mummy? Is mummy ok?Yes. She’s asleep. She’s fine.The car’s clock still reads 23:59. There are fireworks going off everywhere and we’re on a bridge, all the cars have stopped and everyone is standing by the side of their cars, but me and my dad are still inside ours. I look at my dad in the dashboard mirror and he smiles. The clock hits midnight.I love you.I love you too.Then everything stops.The next morning-	I wake up in my bed to the sound of birdsong. I pick up my phone and call my girlfriend. Hi.Oh my God my beautiful. Are you ok.Yes, I’m fine.Are you sure? Where are you? I love you. I love you so much.I’m at home. Everything’s fine. I love you. What happened?You took acid.My dad told me later that day that the night before, I had taken acid, had had a bad trip, and was running through the streets of London shouting and screaming at people, running in the middle of the road, and at T+8.00, he had to come and pick me up and drive me home.  I later asked T and S if there had been any fireworks that night, they said no. I also asked my dad if we went over a big bridge at any point. He said no.I think about that night every day. I run through everything I can remember in my head, and try to work it out, but I don’t really get anywhere. There are about 4-5 hours in total of my trip that I have no recollection of at all. There was a lot of other stuff I saw that night that I can’t remember now. I think that’s probably a good thing.Exp Year: 2010ExpID: 90041Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 17 Published: Nov 28, 2012Views: 24,310    LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Nature / Outdoors (23), Music Discussion (22), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab) 100 mg MDMA  3 oralAlcohol - Beer/Wine    smokedCannabis BODY WEIGHT:155 lbThis entire event transpired on the Saturday night before Halloween. I was visiting my cousin, James (not his real name) and his girlfriend, Sherry (not her real name) at their house about three hours away from where I live. I was planning to visit them for the weekend and together attend a very festive Halloween house party that had a phenomenal psychedelic-jam band playing there all night. I was excited; I knew it was going to be a great night with some great friends.After suiting up in our costumes and arriving at the party/concert, we all decided to drop some acid before the music started. This was 30-something-th time for me so I was pretty comfortable with the drug and familiar with what to expect. However, having taken this specific batch of acid multiple times before, I decided I was comfortable enough with it to up the dosage to 2 hits – which was something I’ve never done before. I’ve taken a hit then taken another several hours after peaking, but never have stacked two together simultaneously. “I’ve got this shit,” I thought as I dropped the blotter paper in my mouth. “This is business as usual.”While waiting for the L to kick in, I decided to just take a little dip of molly – not too much; 100mg seemed about right. I figured this would ease the tension I always get when waiting for the acid to hit. About an hour later, I was feeling GOLDEN! I had an amazing body high. I was jamming to the music and was completely perplexed by the setup of on-stage lighting effects. I was very familiar with what I was feeling. It was just more intense, but nothing uncomfortable or foreign. With these two hits of L paired with a smidge of molly, great music, a few beers and great friends and family all around me, I was on cloud nine. I was experiencing different dimensions of reality and different ways of experiencing music. I felt like nothing could have brought me down.Shortly afterwards, a friend of mine who was there, Charles (not his real name), lit a blunt and passed it to me. He and I both shared it as we danced to the music. This is where I made a poor decision. I have an uneasy history with marijuana. I’m not an avid smoker, but the occasional times I DO decide to toke up, I will sometimes find myself dizzy, confused, stupid, and completely unaware of my surroundings. I didn’t know it then, but adding a hefty dose of cannabis to what was already in my system was a recipe for complete and utter chaos, ESPECIALLY with my history of becoming paranoid and irritable while under its influence. I should have known better.About 5 minutes later, all I remembered was that I was completely overwhelmed with sensory input and was suddenly very ill-equipped to process reality now that I was high. I had become disoriented, confused, and very uneasy with my surroundings. “I’ve gotta get outta here,” I thought. “I need to get out in the open.” So I left the dance floor and escaped to the exterior of the house. I decided to retreat from the party and head back to the tent I had pitched in the close-by field. James and Sherry’s tent was right next to mine. I thought it would be best to just sit down in the grass, relax and just take it all in. It only got worse. I starting to forget where I was, who I was, how I got to where I was, what time it was, and even who I was with. This complete stupor was most likely a result of the cannabis, because in the past with taking just acid alone, I’ve stayed sharp. I may have been tripping, but at least I was still sharp and in tune with my surroundings. This time was different. I wasn’t just tripping. I was beginning to lose my entire grip on reality. The full moon was surrounded by swirling kaleidoscopic patterns of color. The trees around me were composed of fractal, geometric structures. Everything was FUCKED!At this point, I panicked and managed to pull out my phone and dial James up for help. “James, you’ve gotta get out here! I’m having a bad trip and am starting to lose it!”“Alright, I’ll be right there,” he reassured me.James had always been there for me when I needed him. He was a mentor to me; someone I had looked up to for a long time. He is a very kind and open-minded individual, which is something I had always admired about him. He was also very experienced with LSD and knew how to navigate through its waters with ease. Shortly after I hung up the phone, he came out to check on me. I told him I was starting to lose it – that I was having trouble recalling where I was and who I was. At this point, he thought I was kidding around with him and playing a game.“You KNOW who you are,” he replied. “You cannot be serious. C’mon, act like an adult, here.”I began rattling off facts about myself. I told him my name, where I was born and who my parents were. At that moment, I began thinking about my family -- specifically my mother, my father, and my sister. While trying to remember my family and the memories I had with them, I think James was trying to explain the universe to me (I honestly cannot vividly remember). He was talking to me about atoms and energy and waves and LSD and thoughts and emotions. All the while, I was trying to hold on to the memories of my family that were slipping away from my mind. On one hand, I’m trying not to lose the memories of my family that are near and dear to me. On the other hand, my cousin was severely fucking with my head (which I don’t believe he was doing on purpose) trying to calm me down and explain things to me.Nevertheless, I began FREAKING OUT! I somehow got it in my head that this man in front of me was evil and was attempting to steal my childhood memories of my family from me. In hindsight, what scared me the most was the fact that, at that point, I lost all connection with reality and no longer recognized James as my cousin. All I knew was that I was losing the memories of my family forever and the person talking to me was responsible for this. This was NOT okay with me! All I wanted was to feel my mother and father’s love one last time before I was sure I’d never see or remember them again. My fight or flight instinct kicked in. I remember swinging at him and wrestling around with him for a while. I tried booking it and taking off running, desperately attempting to get away from James so I can catch my memories before they were completely gone. He caught up to me and tackled me. I didn’t know it then, but he did this out of love and concern. He didn’t want me running off into the street or getting lost while completely blitzkrieged out of my gourd. When he tackled me, I thought I was getting attacked and was about to be beat to death. “Oh my god, this is it. I’m about to get killed. I’m going to die!” I thought.I began screaming, “Help! Get off me! I don’t know you!” Almost as soon as those words left my mouth, I heard him trying to calm me down. “Shhhh. It’s okay. It’s okay. You’re just having a bad trip.” Right then a stranger ran up to me. He smiled, told me his name, and that everything was going to be alright. This kid was very calm and very welcoming. Just his presence alone made me feel calm again. I began talking with him and immediately started calmeding down. I explained to him that I was losing the memories of my family – that all I wanted was to feel their love one last time before they were gone forever (which I still believed by the way, I believed James was taking my family away from me). He told me to try and remember my parents; I couldn’t. I had very little memory of who I was and where I came from.This is what is called ego-death: losing your sense of you. I had heard about it before, but had never experienced it for myself until that night. It was the most terrifying thing I had ever experienced. I was gone. I had no memories and no recollection of who I was. Everything and everyone was completely foreign to me. I began panicking even more. “Fuck!! I’m forgetting my family and my friends!!” I thought. “I must be dying!” I realized that if I was dying and losing my memories, then my parents were going to be gone forever. To this day, my parents are deeply religious. Up until I was 18 or so, I practiced Christianity with my parents. Although I was no longer religious or believed in the Christian doctrine, I had become convinced that I was losing my family because they were leaving me behind in this life because I wasn’t following in their religious footsteps. Don’t ask me how. Don’t ask me why, but that idea somehow was very plausible to me at the time...probably from the years and years the childhood, religious indoctrination I had lodged in my subconscious mind.I was convinced that my family and all my memories of them were leaving me, and it was all because I went astray from the religious upbringing I was brought up under. I somehow thought I was going to be without them for the rest of my existence unless I could make them want to come back for me. I climbed the house’s pool fence in order to get as high up to the sky as I could. I reached out to the full moon and began desperately screaming, “NOOO! NOOOOOO!! DON’T LEAVE ME!!! MOM!! DAD!!! I’M SORRY! DON’T LEAVE ME!! JESUS!!!! JESUS!!! JESUS!!!! MOM!! DAD!!! I’M SO SORRY!!! DON’T LEAVE ME!!!”I had never been more terrified in my life. Here I was in the middle of this party screaming out at the top of my lungs for Jesus, not because I suddenly believed in the trinity or wanted to become a Christian, but because I thought it was the only way my family and would accept me and return to me; to me, it was the only feasible way to get my memories of them back.At this point, everyone at this party was either freaking out or just staring at me, either laughing hysterically or too shocked to know what to do. Now feeling like I had lost my family, I felt as if I somehow transitioned into a world devoid of all love, compassion, warmth, and kindness. I just collapsed on the ground too fucked up to even remember I had taken 2 hits of acid and had smoked a blunt. I was convinced I was now dead and stuck in an eternal world without love or joy. At this point Charles came up to me to make sure I was alright. I was so fucked up, I didn’t even recognize him. All I saw were people in their Halloween costumes and believed everyone was out to get me...to kill or rape me. I completely freaked out and swung and Charles, hitting him right in the face. I took off running again.I ran into James and explained to him that I just wanted to feel love again. I just wanted to feel the kind of compassion that my mother and father gave to me all throughout my life. I just wanted to be able to love others and be loved. He took me over to Sherry and had her comfort me. She hugged me and told me everything was going to be alright. I looked at her and recognized her as someone I knew, but not as my cousin’s girlfriend. All I knew was that I was being reassured by someone I vaguely recognized who really did genuinely care for me and love me as family. I felt like she helped pull me out of the dark space I was in. I started feeling relief. I didn’t know what to do other than to try to kiss her out of sheer gratitude. Almost as soon as I attempted this, I immediately was hit with the realization that I just tried to kiss someone that I shouldn’t have been trying to kiss. Looking back, I am sure I would have tried to kiss anyone, male or female, (probably even James or Charles) if he or she was the one who pulled me out of that dark state of mind. Sherry just happened to be the person that did just that and ended up getting caught in the crossfire of my nasty trip.I think at this point, the kind stranger (who later introduced himself as Jared) stepped in and said, “Let’s go for a walk.” The next thing I knew, I was walking down an empty street with him trying to recollect what had just happened. I was trying to gather any memory of who I was and how I arrived at the place I was in. Just walking down this silent, empty street surrounded by green traffic lights was both peaceful and haunting. I was completely convinced that because my memory had completely been erased, I had died and was transitioning into my next stage of existence. I felt as if he and I were the only beings left in the lonely world we were walking together through. He told me he was my guide and that I would find my parents again soon. I kept telling him I was no longer myself but had died and was waiting to be born again into a new body. I was telling him of all the things I wished I could have done and all the things I wish I could have said to my friends and family before I died. I told him how selfish I was to my parents all through my childhood – how I never gave them back the love they so dearly deserved in return from me. I began weeping after suddenly realizing I could have given so much more back to the world before I died if I wasn’t so selfish. I didn’t care that I was being watched. At that point, I had nothing to prove to anyone; emotions just flowed freely through them and I wore them on my sleeve.Jared then hit me with stunning news:“You’re not dead,” he said. “You had just mixed LSD and marijuana to the point where you forgot everything you had even known. You are very alive, but your ego – your sense of self – is completely dead.”Ironically enough, I had then looked up and gazed across the street to see a church with a giant cross lit up on the side of it.“My parents are in there!!” I exclaimed. I didn’t realize or remember this then, but since a very young age, I had always associated the symbol of a cross with my mother. So seeing this giant, lighted cross somehow immediately convinced my subconscious mind that both my extremely religious mother and father, whom I thought I had lost forever, were in this church. Jared and I walked around the church for a bit. I don’t think he knew this, but I was looking for a way in. I told him that my parents were trapped in there and that I needed to get in the church to be reunited with them. He suggested instead that I sit down and evaluate my life – what I didn’t like about myself, what I wanted to change about myself, what I want out of life, and what I should do to mend my broken relationship with my parents.We sat in front of this church for a while just facing the street. I sat thinking to myself with Jared by my side for what felt like hours. After a while, the LSD and marijuana began to subside. My memories began coming back to me. I was so relieved to know I hadn’t died and would be able to see my family again. Almost as soon as I became overjoyed with the awareness that I was alive and actually didn’t lose my memories, I began to remember everything had transpired that night.“Oh fuck…I crashed a party, didn’t I?”“yeah...” Jared said.“Oh my god...oh my god...I attacked James!”“He’s fine,” Jared reassured me. “You should just feel grateful you didn’t end up in jail, or worse, dead in the middle of the street.”I took a while to gather my thoughts and attempt to meaningfully recollect everything that happened that night. I remembered struggling and wrestling with James not knowing he was James. I remembered attempting to kiss Sherry not knowing she was Sherry. I remembered screaming at the moon in terror and agony thinking it would keep the memories of my parents and my sister return to me.“God, I’m pathetic,” I thought. “I made a complete basket case of myself in front of friends, family, and strangers. The only way I’m going to recover from this, is if I take a few lessons from this and learn from them.” That is exactly what I did and am still striving to do now. As I was coming back to Earth and regaining my footing with reality, I began asking myself, “Now what? Where do I go from here?”It didn’t take long to realize the biggest lesson I was taught from that night was that my parents and I have a lot of unfinished business; I am not ready to lose either one of them yet. They both needed to know how much I truly love and care for them. The following morning, on the drive back to my house, I called both of them and told them I was thinking about both of them and that I loved them very much. Just doing that seemed to fill a big hole in my life. I can’t remember the last time I had said that to them.I also learned (relearned actually) that the universe will fuck you sideways if you’re not willing to accept what it’s presenting to you and deal head on with personal issues that LSD forces you to see in yourself.I learned that mixing marijuana with LSD is a bad idea...at least for me. It was a very unsettling feeling for me to be so sideways, I didn’t know who I was and what was real anymore. Never again, do I want to get to the point where I fail to recognize friends and family or become senselessly violent. This scared me because I am not a violent person in the least; I am usually very friendly to others.Lastly, I learned that I am not invincible. This may sound silly, but until that night, I have always walked through life believing that nothing terribly bad could ever happen to me and that traumatic events always happened to “the other guy.” I couldn’t have been more wrong. I don’t care what anybody says. I died that night. I may not have died physically, but I got as close to death as I could ever imagine...to the point where I felt I had once been that way before I was born: without any sense of self or memory. I’m sure it would have been beautiful had I been expecting it and had been in that space under different circumstances. After all was said and done, everyone I had negatively affected that night had forgiven me, even James, Sherry, and Chuck. I feel there were more people who felt sorry for me than there were people who were angry or scared of me. In fact, the following day, I came to find out that many of the party-goers thought it was one of the funniest, most epic meltdowns they had ever seen. Apparently, according to James, some people, at first, thought I was putting on a hilarious act when I was climbing the fence screaming with every fiber of my being. Although, it was very real for me, I am glad there was entertainment value for others that came out of it. For me, it was a valuable lesson the universe taught me.Exp Year: 2012ExpID: 98101Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 25 Published: Dec 12, 2012Views: 39,417    Alcohol - Beer/Wine (199), Cannabis (1), MDMA (3), LSD (2) : Large Group (10+) (19), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), Combinations (3) DOSE:5 hitsoralLSDBODY WEIGHT:150 lbIt all started on January 10, 2008. This is a list of the events (minus some of the more embarrassing ones) that occurred on that day. I cannot be sure of the order in which they all occurred since my memories of it are all jumbled around, but Iĺll try my best to write it down it the right order. I consider myself somewhat experienced with acid, however nothing could have ever prepared me for the events that occurred on this nightmarish day. It had been one month to the day since I had taken acid. I had a new acid guy that I had been buying from for awhile. Iĺll just call him SK. They were sugar cubes and they were fifteen a hit, sixty for five, and ten each for any order of ten and up. I know. Itĺs horrible, but he did always have some pretty good fucking acid. It would vary though. It would always be good, but sometimes itĺd be much weaker or much stronger than normal. Now he hadnĺt had any for a month. Two days before my trip, Iĺd called him. Iĺd left a message telling him that I wanted 20. He called me back the next day and informed me that he could get up to thirty tomorrow. So I said I wanted twenty. He said, ôO.K.ö. The next day, I tried to call him over and over. He wouldnĺt pick up. Finally he called me back and said that he had it. I said I only wanted ten. In a pissed off voice, he said that he had just gotten twenty because Iĺd told him that I wanted it. I told him Iĺd call my friend and see if he wanted any. I called my friend and he said that he was saving up to buy an ounce of coke. So I tried to call my guy up. He didnĺt answer. A little while later, I got my phone out to call him again, only to find that Iĺd missed a call from him a few minutes before. I called him up and told him I could do fifteen. He told me to hold on because it was all in one big thing and he had to go home and chop it up. Yeah right. Who makes their own sugar cubes anyways?  He called me about fifteen minutes later and told me that he had it ready. I told him that it wouldnĺt be a good idea to try to rip me off. I told him that I wanted them all to be real and equally powerful. He said that he was trying to get me a good deal and asked me how many times Iĺd bought acid from him. He told me that nobody was trying to me rip me off. He asked me where I wanted to meet and I told him I could meet him in the graveyard since thereĺd be no cops. He told me he didnĺt want to meet there, but to meet him in the Kroger parking lot right by there.I walked there and saw him by a parked car that was full of people. A Decatur cop car rolled by and I told him that it had. He said, ôI knowö. The guy in the driverĺs seat said something about Decatur. My guy pulled a string of sugar cubes wrapped in tinfoil out of his jacket pocket. Then he told me to put the money in the backseat of the car. I did. I just wanted to get this over with as quick as possible because I was afraid that the cops would roll up. I asked if he had change for a hundred because I had put one forty five or one forty three in the car. He asked the people in the car if anyone had change. They all said they didnĺt. He said, ôLet me take a look at this.ö  He looked at it and asked if I just wanted to get ten because he was trying to give me a good deal and it was a pain in the ass to have to take one out. I said, ôO.K.ö, and he pulled a big zip lock bag with two sets of five cubes wrapped up in tinfoil. I told him to give me my other shit back. He handed me my other leftover money. I asked the driver if I could get a ride since I was nervous walking on the street with acid. He told me that any other time he would have, but the car was packed, which it was. I told him O.K. and walked back home.I called a friend and asked him if he wanted to hang out. He told me that he would in awhile. I asked to talk to my other friend who lived in his basement. It was the same one Iĺd talked to earlier. I told him that I was coming over later and would give him a hit. He said that was cool. I told him peace and hung up. Now Iĺd never heard of anyone ever taking more than two of these, so I decided to take five. Now what I think happened, is SK got twenty hits and was mad that I didnĺt buy them all, so he dosed at least five of them very heavily. I think he did this during the time when he thought I was getting only ten. When he found out that I would get fifteen, he decided to just give me fifteen regular hits, but when I was seven dollars short of 150, he decided to give me the bag of two sets of ten instead of the foil of fifteen, which was the bag with the five (or at least five, I never tried the other five) super dosed hits. I let them dissolve in my mouth and then I swallowed them. I think that I stashed the other five in my dresser drawer and then decided to put them in my coat pocket, which was lying on my closet shelf.I had smoked a little bit of weed with some of my friends a few hours before, but Iĺd come down quite awhile before this and had less than a buzz. Now I know that this is going to sound unbelievable, but if I were going to tell a lie, Iĺd at least tell a believable one. Iĺve never heard of anyone feeling acid in this amount of time, but literally two minutes after swallowing them, I felt an intense warmth in my stomach. In seconds, the warmth had spread throughout my entire body. It was probably about ten seconds or so after the warmth in my stomach began, that I got a vision change. My vision wasnĺt blurry, but it was a little bit like I was looking through someone elseĺs glasses. It was different than that, but thatĺs the only way I know how to describe it. I got extremely excited. Then I walked around my room and I think I went into my bathroom and looked in the mirror. Then I started feeling sedated and lied down on my bed. About five minutes after taking the acid, I decided to go downstairs and see what time it was. As I walked down the stairs, I looked out at the lawn through the living room windows. Now it was still green, but it was as if my mind saw it as silver. I thought of the fact that it was the exact same shade of silver as the silver Christmas tree our family had. I didnĺt realize that the tree was right by the window until a few days later. As I turned my head towards the bookcase, the thought/picture of a tiger with silver and black stripes entered my head. I realized that I was going to have a real trip. I went down into the kitchen and then I went back upstairs. I realized about three minutes or so later that Iĺd forgotten to check the time. I went back downstairs. The stairs were bent off to the left and as I walked down, I felt as if I were walking at an angle. I walked into the kitchen. I think that I might have walked out of the kitchen and into the living room to go back upstairs when I realized Iĺd forgotten again. I went back into the kitchen and saw the time. I donĺt remember what time it was, but I estimated that itĺd probably been about ten minutes, making the time of ingestion around five fifteen.I did something for a few minutes. I donĺt specifically remember what. I think I was in my room. Then I realized that I was getting way too fucked up, way too quick. I went into the kitchen and saw the time. A wave of fear swept through me. It was five fifteen. How could I be feeling like this in only fifteen minutes? The colors had gotten duller in a way. In another way though, they were a little shinier. I only noticed that my vision had changed, though. I didnĺt analyze how. Everything looked kind of like a very realistic painting. I didnĺt notice this at the time, though. I walked into my living room and out onto my front porch. A second after closing the door, I realized what a horrible mistake Iĺd made.The handle on the front of my door was gone. It was in fact gone in real life. I knew that all the other doors were locked. Iĺd locked myself out. I walked around and tried the side door, knowing that it was locked. Then I went around back and walked around the trampoline to delay trying to open the back sliding that I knew had a board in the place that would allow it to slide to open. As I walked towards the trampoline, which was towards the back of the yard, I looked into the yard beside me. I tried to call a friend who lived up in Illinois where my boarding school was. I started having the conversation before I even called him. The phone rang and rang. Finally I hung up. I thought I heard my old friend say, ôHelloö just as I hung up. I didnĺt want to sound desperate, so I didnĺt call him back. There was a golden tint to everything. I thought, 'This is what a tripĺs like.'When I was beside the trampoline, I looked down. Both of my feet were bent off to the right and I could see where the bone was sticking out at the same place on both sides. I didnĺt see the bones themselves, but I saw them poking out underneath my pants. I knew that this wasnĺt real, but it made it clear of exactly how fucked up I was going to get. I thought, ĹIĺm feeling like this and seeing things like this now. I might have no idea whatĺs going on when I peak in two or two and a half hours from now.ĺ I know that acid can take longer than that to peak, but those were my thoughts. I realized that I could seriously hurt or even kill myself. I looked down again and saw my broken legs. The third time I looked down, I had completed my lap around the trampoline and was walking towards the house. In addition to having broken legs, my feet were now a melted puddle. I remembered that part a few weeks later. I started walking around in circles by my driveway saying, ôNo. No. No. No.öThen I started walking towards my house. My yard seemed much longer and stretched out than normal. I knew that it seemed more stretched out, but I didnĺt realize just how much longer it seemed until I looked at the yard again while sober. It seemed that Iĺd been walking towards my house for quite a bit longer than I really had been. It was as if I was on a conveyor belt and was walking in place, getting no closer to my house. I reassured myself that it was just a drug effect and that Iĺd get there soon. I mentally told myself to be calm. I tried to open the sliding door, but it had the board there, just as I knew it would.I went around to a side window by the air conditioning, which was my way into the house when it was locked. My mom didnĺt like me to get in that way, so she used to put boards and curtain rods in the windows to keep me from opening them. I used to use the shovel to pry it open. I had come in through the window when Iĺd gotten back. Iĺd also put the curtain rod back in place so my mom wouldnĺt know Iĺd come in that way. However, if you push the window up really hard, it would knock the curtain rod down. I stood on the blue bench that Iĺd put there awhile back specifically for the purpose of standing on to crawl inside. I started pushing the window up as hard as I could to knock down the curtain rod. It would just ram the rod up against the top of the pain. I started to think about breaking the window, but then I thought about how mad my mom was when Iĺd busted the lock. I also thought about how Iĺd have to pay for it. A bead of sweat dripped down my face, feeling like sea foam spraying on me. I felt like I was hunting for whales in the seventeenth or eighteenth century, and the bench I was standing on was my boat. I started thinking, ôIs a trip supposed to make me think thoughts like this?ö I didnĺt know if this was normal, or just part of the trip. I started to panic. Then I pushed the window up really hard and it broke the side of the pain and got stuck. It was open just a crack. I tried to pull it down so I could push it up again, but couldnĺt. The thought of breaking the window started to get more and more appealing.I started screaming and smearing my hands across the window. I automatically and unintentionally pictured bloody handprints smeared across it. I looked at my neighborĺs house to see if anyone was watching me. I told myself that I had to quit screaming because someone would call the police, which would make this whole ordeal even worse. I went to the back sliding door and tried to slide the door against the board that blocked it from opening, the same thing I had been trying to do to the window. I started forcefully sliding the door back, in a vain attempt to knock the board out of the slot. Of course this did no good. I went back to the window and finally managed to push it back down. Then I pushed the window up so hard that the curtain rod bent into a ĹVĺ and fell down. I climbed through the window and went upstairs.As I passed the railing, at the height of the top of the stairs, I thought, ôI could end up falling down there today.ö I walked into my bathroom. I looked at myself in the mirror, and then looked down at my arms. They were bright red. So was my face. Iĺve had this effect from acid before. I wasnĺt sure if this discoloration was caused by me freaking out, causing blood to rush to my face, or if it was just a hallucination. As I walked into my room, I thought of the possibility that I could end up accidentally jumping out of my window, killing myself. My room was slanted at an angle that made it look like the side furthest from me was lower than the side by me and my door. My bed seemed really low to the ground.I lied down on my bed. The room and bed were all too familiar to me. They were where I spent so much of my meaningless life. As I lied on my bed, I started worrying that when my trip peaked, I wouldnĺt know up from down, possibly causing me to feel as if I was falling. I stared at the wall. Warped thoughts wandered through my mind. I realized that I was just an animal. I was a primate, doomed to die like the rest of my kind. I woke up in this bed everyday, just to do nothing but live my pointless and temporary life. ĹWhat do I do?ĺ It felt like I was supposed to be doing something. I started thinking things like, ôI have nothing to do because there is nothing to do. Life is so simple and pointless. Itĺs the same shit everyday. Iĺm going to die. My mom is going to die. Iĺm going to be there the day she dies, and nothing can prevent that.ö I started to think about how this drug showed you the ultimate truth. I wanted answers. Now Iĺve got answers. This drug was reality slapped right in my face. It was as if I had just found out for the first time, that I was going to die, and so was everyone that I cared about. We were just human beings. We werenĺt allowed to live forever.I was absolutely consumed in fear. This was a new type of fear that I had never experienced before. It was the horrible realization of what I had already known. I continued to lie on my bed, and started to scream, ôThis is realityö, over and over again. I felt incredibly detached from my surroundings. I didnĺt feel like I was in my room. I was inside of myself. I was zoning out from reality. Then I thought, ôThis is insanityö, over and over again. I could feel the insanity taking me over. I thought, ôNo wonder why they give you seven years a hit (which I know is a myth now). The government made this illegal because it shows you the truth. The government is only an evil empire that has one goal: to control you. They care nothing about us as people. They just want to keep us all in this little fantasy world that everyone lives in. They want to keep us blind to the truth, and thatĺs why this shitĺs so illegal. Theyĺre just mortals controlling mortals.ö Now I saw the truth. Human beings had an expiration date. I was worthless, and my life had no meaning to it. No matter how successful you were in life, you were still nothing in the end. People went to college and did things with their lives, but in the end, they all died. Nothing mattered. This drug showed you exactly how insignificant you really were. It shows you that you really are going to die, and it shows you how nothing will matter in the end. I couldnĺt believe that mankind had created this horrible drug.I couldnĺt believe that those people had even sold me this shit, knowing what it was and what it could do. I felt betrayed, betrayed but not hurt. I knew that it was an illegal drug, but I felt almost as if I had bought it from a pharmacy or something, and had been told it was safe. I thought, ôHow many psych ward trips has this drug causedö, not really as a question, but as a truth. I looked at the wall by my window, and saw a large, blue, solemn looking face. It was probably blue, because the wall it was on was blue. I think that it was over the area where a poster hung. The faceĺs expression seemed to say, ôThis is the truth, John. Now you know. Sorry you had to find out like this.öThen I thought of acid as a monster that looked kind of like that lizard thing from Monsters Inc. I didnĺt see/imagine itĺs face, but I did see/imagine itĺs arms. They were striped. Half of the stripes were dark purple, and every other stripe was a lighter purple in color. I started getting extremely hot, and sweated profusely. So I went into the hallway and tried to turn down the thermostat. I held down the blue button, but couldnĺt tell if the temperatureĺs Ĺdegrees numberĺ was going down. Somehow I remembered that some of the time, I had to do something else before I could turn down the heat, however I wasnĺt sure if this thought was true or just a delusion. Although I didnĺt realize it at the time, I would normally have had to switch a button to cool, if it wasnĺt already on cool. There were constantly changing, unidentifiable, alien-like numbers all over the screen. In real life, there are two numbers and a few letters on the screen at one time, one of which changes back and forth from temperature to a clock.I went back into my room, lied down on the bed, and then pulled off my clothes. I felt wet, kind of like an amphibian. This was probably due to the fact that I was sweating. I felt as if I were trapped inside a sauna. I also felt incredibly fragile, like my skin could easily be punctured. I lied there for a minute or two, thinking about all types of fucked up shit. Then I thought, ôItĺs probably not a good idea to be naked right now. If I do end up losing all control and walking down the street, I should at least be dressed. Thoughts of me walking around naked filled my mind. Then a thought/picture went threw my mind. The view I imagined it in was as if from a camera that was behind my ankle. I could only see my feet, ankles, and a little bit of my legs, or it may only have been one ankle, one leg, and a foot. I was walking naked in front of my across-the-street-neighborĺs house. I thought of/saw myself take one last step before standing still.A noise in my head went along with the thought. I donĺt think that I actually heard it, but I did imagine it. The noise seemed to say, ôThis is serious. Heĺs dangerously fucked up. Heĺs a threat to himself and everyone around him. Heĺs almost like a dangerous animal running loose in society. Look what itĺs come to, John.ö I thought of the police. They didnĺt seem real. They seemed like they didnĺt even exist, and even if they did, they were no threat to me. I had bigger problems at hand. It wouldnĺt have embarrassed me to walk out of the house naked, but I put my clothes back on, which was a wise decision. I lied there for awhile.Then I realized that I had to flush my system out. I had taken the acid on an empty stomach, like always. I felt that I should drink a lot of water and eat anything, even bread. As I was walking out my bedroom door to go to the sink, I thought, ôIĺm going to be like this forever.ö I went to the sink and drank as much as I could, which wasnĺt a lot. There was something horrible about drinking. I think that drinking might have reminded me of drowning. I looked in the mirror. My face was a little bluish in color. It felt weird to look at myself. I thought, ôThatĺs me. Thatĺs who Iĺve been my whole life.ö Iĺd had this thought the first time I looked in the mirror, since getting back inside, however, it was more intense this time. I was almost like a cartoon character or something. It seemed strange that I was a real person.I didnĺt want to go downstairs to eat, so I went back into my room and lied down on my bed. The horrible thought that this was only the beginning, played through my mind over and over again. I thought, ôI have to go to sleep, but will I even be able to sleep on acid?ö Something told me that I normally knew that acid was one of those drugs that you couldnĺt sleep on, which I did in fact know. I just wasnĺt sure at the time. Then I thought, ôIs sleep even real?ö Iĺm pretty sure that upon thinking this, I saw the sentence ôIs sleep even realö, written across my field of vision, the letters possibly made from objects in the room that became highlighted at my thought. I couldnĺt recall having ever slept before. I thought that it might be real, but I wasnĺt quite sure. I thought that the concept of sleep might be some sort of delusion. I didnĺt even know if Ĺsleepĺ, was a real word. It seemed as if this state of unconsciousness that you indulged in for a few hours, which left you refreshed and sober upon awaking, was pretty far fetched, but possibly real. I thought that Iĺd try it. I closed my eyes and tried to go to sleep.I had very intense closed eye visuals. I think that most of them were visuals of both my face and my momĺs, floating around with strange backgrounds, however Iĺm not sure. The one I do remember for sure is my arms and legs separating from my body and floating around my head in a world of nothing but orange or red space. This hellish background was infinite. I remembered the friend I was supposed to see that day, the one whom I had called first. Remembering myself talking to him was like looking back a lifetime. He was just a character in my life. I knew nothing about him. He was part of the past now. Iĺd never see him again. The sense of detachment from the life Iĺd once known was unbelievably intense. The thought that my mom was going to die became overwhelming. I thought of her and I mightĺve thought of how much she loved me. Eventually I started to wonder, ôIs my mom even real or is she just a delusion?ö I think that the sentence, ĹIs mom even realĺ, mightĺve spelled itself out in my visual imagination. Iĺm mot sure, though. It might have just done that for sleep. The thought of a mom seemed so fake. What was this so called Ĺmomĺ, of mine?  I started to think about the word Ĺmomĺ. Then I realized that even the word seemed unreal. ĹMomĺ was no longer what I thought of when I normally thought of mom. It wasnĺt a name (even though it isnĺt technically a name). It was a title. It wasnĺt my mom. It was the mom. Everything started losing itĺs familiarity and becoming titles, or concepts, if you will. I opened my eyes, and lied there for awhile. The feeling of detachment had considerably increased. I realized that I probably wasnĺt going to be getting any sleep, even if there was such a thing. So even though I knew that I probably couldnĺt, I decided that I was going to try and turn this thing around. So I went into my bathroom to get my boom box. I remembered that I had listened to it in the shower that morning. I went in there and couldnĺt find it. I went back into my room and looked around for it. It wasnĺt in there, so I went back into the bathroom and found it. It was on the shelf. It was shape shifting in my hand as I brought it back into my room. I plugged it in, which wasnĺt difficult but seemed to take a lot of effort. Then I grabbed my stack of CDs. Iĺm not sure if I had grabbed them while in the bathroom, or if Iĺd picked them up off of my table. I wanted to find my burned CD that had Dramamine by Modest Mouse on it. I looked through a few CDs to find it, but I just couldnĺt stand there and look through them all. I just couldnĺt bear to. At the time I figured it was a good thing since I really should have been trying to sleep.I lied down for a while. I felt as if I was deep in a trance and that sleep was near. However, the thought that I was going to sleep, and the thought that I had to go to sleep, snapped me out of the trance every time. I donĺt remember myself having ever quit my attempt towards sleep, so I probably just forgot about it. I was laying there with my eyes open, thinking about my mom, thinking about how I might jump out the window. I was thinking about that and a lot of other crazy shit when I realized that I was still in my bedroom. I had completely forgotten where I was. The room was still there, but the feeling of detachment had grown so extreme that I had forgotten where I was. It seemed like a long time since I had been there in my room. It felt like the background around me was unreal, kind of like a painting (or blanket as I thought at the time) over the blackness that truly existed. I started thinking, ôWhatĺs going to happen when my mom gets home?  What if I end up killing her, not even knowing what Iĺm doing?öAs I thought this, I called her on my cell phone. I didnĺt even know that I had called her, or even that I had my cell phone in my hand, until I heard her say, ôHello.ö  It felt so unreal hearing her voice and talking to her. I wanted to hang up, but realized that this could be my last time talking to her. I thought that if I were mean and hung up, something really bad might happen to me, kind of like a karma effect. I said, ôMom.ö ôYeah?ö ôIĺm sorry!ö ôWhat are you talking about?ö ôNothing...Iĺm sorry!ö ôWhat the fuck! Donĺt fuck with me, John! What did you get into?öI donĺt remember the rest of the conversation, but I think she asked me where I was or if I was at the house, or something like that. It felt like talking to someone I hadnĺt seen or heard from in a long time. It felt like she was someone thatĺd played an important and long-lasting role in my life, but was no longer a part of it. My mom told me that when she got to the house and came into my room, I was lying down on the bed flicking a lighter in front of my face screaming, ôThis is realityö, over and over. I can vaguely remember flicking the lighter in front of my face. I was doing it absentmindedly. I remember when I first noticed my mom. She was in my doorway. She asked me if I wanted her to get someone there that could help me. I screamed, ôYesö, not even realizing what I was saying or what it meant. I wasnĺt even surprised to notice her, even though I hadnĺt realized when sheĺd arrived. I know that I hadnĺt realized when sheĺd arrived because she was talking as if we were in the middle of a conversation.I remember hearing her talking on the phone and saying, ôHey, now Iĺm not sure what you would in this situation.ö Then, I snapped out of my trance for a second and realized what was going on, so I jumped up, ran towards her, and screamed, ôNo!ö She said, ôJohn, itĺs O.K.ö That was the second from last visual memory for hours. The last was a simple picture in my head of a cop opening my dresser drawer. I remembered this weeks later. Itĺs a good thing that I put the acid in my coat pocket. I got other visual memories back, as the months went by. I have auditory memories of people talking. According to my mom, I was telling the paramedics and cops that I loved them over and over. Apparently I also told them, ôDonĺt do drugs. Donĺt do themö, and they said, ôDonĺt worry, John. We wonĺt.ö  I donĺt remember telling the cops or paramedics that I loved them, but I doubt that I was really sincere. I do love my mom, but when I was telling her that I loved her, I was saying it out of fear and out of the thought that she could bring me out of what I didnĺt even know was a trip. As crazy as it may sound, the events above, up until the part with the lighter, were probably only a description of the first thirty to forty minutes or so after ingestion. Maybe died every time, or may have only died at the end.(upside down triangle)THE TRIPApparently the paramedics took me to the hospital in an ambulance, although I donĺt remember it. At some point, what must have been some nurses or paramedics, came and started doing something to me. I remember all those gloved hands reaching down and grabbing me. I can remember them grabbing my arms. They didnĺt seem human. I remember my mom standing in the background staring at me. There was the sound of voices. I donĺt even know if I knew that they were voices at the time. I couldnĺt and didnĺt even try to understand them. They were all mingled together and didnĺt sound like noises people would make. It sounded distant, like the last words in a dream when the person on TV wakes up. It sounded like alien cafeteria chatter.I remember seeing my face many times throughout the trip. People, including me would be very discombobulated, usually with very big heads on small, often deformed bodies. I would often observe myself from a third person point of view. These hallucinatory scenarios would take me extremely far from reality. I had lost all memory of my previous life, along with all memories of my friends and family. I might remember seeing words written on my visuals. I might remember being in, and/or seeing people in some future school where the students wear all white and stand out on multileveled platforms (possibly with the platforms getting shorter and shorter on the way down).There were many things in my trip that had this shape. By this shape, I mean sets of rectangular shapes that go from top to bottom, starting off big and getting smaller, eventually ending in one tiny rectangle. I think that this is a metaphor for life beginning, passing by, and eventually fading away. I would go out to smoke weed all the time. My mom would ask me where I was going. I would reply the way I usually do in real life. ôNowhere.ö  She would say, ôO.K.ö She would give me a sad look. I knew that she knew what I was going out to do. I remember saying, ôFuck youö to her once for a reason I canĺt remember. I remember seeing a look of hurt in her eyes. I never actually remember smoking weed or being high, but I knew that that was what I was going out to do.I remember my mom saying something along the lines of, ôJohn, just relax. Itĺll all be over soon.ö Of course, I thought that it was my life that was going to be over. I wondered what was after life. I thought it a terrifying thought to just give in to death. I fought it by doing all I could, jerking my body from left to right, up and down, and all around with an energy brought on by fear, desperation, and the delusional knowledge that I would definitely die if I lay back and let the force take me away. I knew that I would probably die any second either way.Eventually I finally let go of life. I donĺt exactly know what would happen next. I get a picture of my momĺs hand in mine. It changes with the stages of the trip in my mind. Her hand would drastically change in mine and I would get some strange and surreal, yet sad and final-feeling emotions I donĺt think Iĺve ever felt before. She kept on telling me that it was O.K. and to just relax or something. I interpreted this as possibly helpful advice not to struggle anymore because it was inevitable. I eventually quit struggling. I either let go or experienced the last sights and feelings of worldly customs and experiences. Those things were all in the past now. Hard times would come for me and my mom. I could feel my motherĺs death approaching. It was definitely a much realer aspect in this life than in my real-life life, although I knew nothing of my real-life life. I was worried about it.I remember my life going through incredible changes throughout the whole trip. There were so many stages where pretty much everything changed over and over. My senses of touch (which was mostly comprised of out-of-body sensations), sight, and hearing were all out of whack and getting more and more distorted as time went by. Me, my mother, and my life all went through incredible changes where my perceptions, mind states, personalities, realities, emotions, my feelings towards everything changed drastically. My momĺs role in my life constantly changed. Crazy shit happened all the time.Iĺm not sure about this part, but I might have seen something that represented death in the shapes of humans. I think I might have noticed how people get skinnier at the legs, eventually disappearing into the floor. This was a metaphor for death. Death felt especially real. It was absolutely horrible. These scenarios would torture my mind in many different ways. I would have different lives and I would die over and over. I think I had nine hundred and something lives at one point I checked. I think I probably started with nine hundred and ninety nine or a thousands lives. I remember them as little green circles, possibly spheres. I think they may have been in a basket or on platforms designed like a shelf with no walls and multiple platforms, lying in rows. I think I might have been welcomed by my mom into either each life, or some of them, possibly with other people. It was common knowledge that everyone had all those lives. I knew I would live thousands and thousands of years.I donĺt remember the thought of specific increments of time, but it would have been many years. However, I knew that death was eventually going to catch up with me. I remember asking my mom if I was going to die someday. She told me that I was going to and she might have said not to worry about it. I get a picture of a shelf-like structure without boundaries, with weird looking humanoid beings (possibly my mom) in rows on each platform. I get the impression that each level represents a kind of chapter in the trip. I also remember seeing two weird, dark humanoid beings with deformed heads sitting on a couch. I donĺt remember knowing I was tripping, but I can vaguely remember thinking about hallucinations and wondering if I could make myself hallucinate, if I was hallucinating, or if I was tripping hard enough to hallucinate. It was one of or some of those possibilities.There were times when I was just watching myself from a third person point of view, unaware that the person I was seeing was me. At those times, I had no identity. I neither questioned, nor knew what I was. I was just watching some person do things. There was this shape that pretty much summed up everything that was. I donĺt remember what parts in the trip I saw it, or what caused me to see it. It could have been between lives, or maybe it wasnĺt. However, I do remember it as being after death, therefore I think it was between lives. This shape was the shape of reality. Reality did have a shape. This shape was almost 4 dimensional. It was the shape of the cycle of life and death. Reality would literally unfold right before my eyes. A series of pictures and concepts would roll by. I would view reality from several different perspectives, one after the other. These perspectives and pictures would roll out to make one big picture. I would see my life, beginning to end, as a picture that would roll out into existence. This shape made of pictures would pretty much sum up my life. The final picture I would see was something that looked a little like a fat tongue with hairs spaced out on its surface, that would roll out and flop down onto nothingness. This final picture represented either death or the end of the cycle that explained what reality is. I think that it also may have represented the sense of taste, one of the five doors to perception. I think that all five senses may have been covered in this shape. Iĺm not sure, though. This truly was the shape of reality.I would then see that the state of being that I had known my whole life was the definition of reality. Reality was in me. I would realize that this was what I was to perceive for all of eternity. This was the new state of being. This was what was left after death. It was simply the state of pointless existence in itself. It was the ability to perceive the repetitive unfolding of reality. All that I was left with was the ability to see this pathetic shape that summed up the nothingness Iĺd made of my life, in one big picture. I perceived this shape with a number of my senses, which fused together into one. As reality unfolded, my inner dialogue would talk to me. It would say things like, ôThis is what reality is. Reality is what reality is.ö It would repeat these sentences over and over again. So this was the big shebang. This was the answer. Reality is what reality is. That was the secret behind reality. It was as if I was mankind itself, everybody that existed, all at once, yet still only me. I was absolutely EVERYTHING. I saw the difference between something being in existence and absolutely nothing existing at all. I was just the eyes to reality, not a person at all. When the reality picture came up, it was the absolute conclusion to everything. It was everything. It was the big mystery behind existence answered. It was like the cover to the book of my life.I think I remember my mom being part of a similar picture/cover at a different time in the trip. She was the main character in my life and was on the cover. When I saw reality itself, my consciousness was bent into a state of perception that is indescribable. This seemed to be the climax of it all, but there was no real beginning or end. It was just the constant repetition of the beginning and the end. This was all there was. There should have been something better than this. A similar phenomenon that occurred is me having a vision of a tree. This tree symbolized reality. There were no leaves on it. It was alive, but dormant. It probably represented the nothingness Iĺd made of my life. As I saw this tree, I began to see how acid was everything. Everything fell into the category of acid one way or another.  Thinking back on it, I think that the reason for this thought is that acid takes control of your brain. Therefore, it takes control of everything youĺve ever thought of and everything youĺve ever experienced. Therefore, it is everything for however long you trip.I think I might have even seen the word Ĺeverythingĺ or Ĺrealityĺ spelled out under the tree. I remember that many of my visions were of weird things and/or beings on those shelf-like structures or in rows. The trip had different chapters in a way. I might remember my vision bouncing forward, pulled by some force. Some scenarios wouldnĺt start that bad, but would surprise me with something horrible. I might possibly remember aging and maybe getting old in the trip. Lots of things would repeat themselves over and over again, driving me insane. There was a craziness about it that I canĺt explain.I wish I could help people understand this without experiencing it, but thereĺs no way you possibly could without going through it yourself. So much happened that I will never remember. Many of my memories of that night felt distant, but I would have these flashes of weird emotions that I experienced on the trip. These memories were the big concepts that I had forgotten. I could feel things missing where things were missing from my memory. I would occasionally be able to pull those memories up for a split second, but they would be gone before I could start to analyze them. Through months of obsessively thinking about those things, I was able to piece together what I have here. INSANITYNow I donĺt remember ever first learning of the thing called insanity, but such a thing did exist. Now insanity wasnĺt what typically comes to peopleĺs minds when they think of the word. It was something of unknown origins. It was kind of like the boogey man. It was something that would come and get you. Iĺm not sure if you had to be bad for it to get you, but I think you might have had to been. Now I wasnĺt sure what it was. I didnĺt know if it was a person, a place, a creature, a spirit, or merely just a state existence, however it was probably real and it was very mysterious. No one knew what it was because when it got you, you couldnĺt come back to tell the story. Once it got you, it had you for good. You were finished. All that I knew about it was that it was by the far the worst thing that could happen to you. It was any manĺs worst nightmare times a thousand. Early on in my life, I was pretty sure that it was real and I didnĺt want it to get me. As life continued and I got older, my belief in this so called Ĺinsanityĺ grew less and less. Eventually I completely disregarded it as a childrenĺs story and pretty much forgot about it altogether.Throughout my lives, I was faced with a lot of decisions to make. I would usually make the bad ones. I would do whichever one was the most pleasurable for me to do. I remember my relationship with my mom begin to change as my lives went by. She was happier with me and would talk to me more in the earlier lives. She seemed more bent on helping me than the other kids. The beginning lives had a sense of childhood to them. As my lives grew fewer and fewer, I aged in a way. Life seemed to drag out and get slower as the later lives came. It was the same pointless shit everyday. All of the fun and adventures were over. Eventually I got myself in a stump in my life. I had nothing to do and had done nothing with myself. My mom seemed to lose hope with me. She seemed emotionally faded. She always looked solemn. She seemed tired of me not caring and seemed to push me away. She wasnĺt angry, though. She seemed to be like, ĹDo whatever you want. You will anyways.ĺ The memories of my life were dark, both visually and emotionally. I donĺt think I remember going to bed, but I remember waking up in my bed plenty of times. I thought, ĹHow many times have I woken up in this bed?ĺLife was boring, dark, worrying, and pointless. I never made anything out of myself. Throughout the later lives, I constantly worried about my momĺs death. I worried about her getting old and dying. I kept thinking that it might happen soon. I even remember her aging. I have a visual memory of seeing her on the stairs with gray hair. I remember this whole memory as happening at the end, but it may have been in the beginning. I could have seen my mom on the bottom of the stairs when the police and paramedics were there. My mom told me that I asked her if she was really sick and was going to die. I donĺt remember asking her this, but it probably happened around this time.Every now and then my mom would casually ask me, ôDo you believe in God?ö Now I didnĺt fully believe in Him, but I knew that life was too complex to be a simple coincidence. I didnĺt believe in him 100%, but I did think that He might have been real. However, I didnĺt want to follow His ways. I wanted to do what I wanted to do. I also didnĺt want to admit that I believed in Him because I was embarrassed of it. I had this tough guy persona I had to keep. Admitting that I kind of believed in Him would be a sign of weakness. I would say, ôNo.ö  I less believed than I believed. One time, my mom said, ôSoö, or, ôSo John, do you believe in God?ö ôNo.ö ôWhy not?ö ôBecause heĺs not real.ö Every time I said, ôNoö, it would result in the same thing. However I wouldnĺt make the connection.I think that there would be a short delay some of the time, and some of the time there would be no delay before the insanity came. Right before the insanity came, my life would turn into a spiral of pictures with a gray, cloudy background. This spiral would coil up into itself. When the spiral appeared, the pictures it was comprised of would start flashing by really fast and curl around like a snake, forming a smaller spiral with the same gray background as soon as it hit the last picture, which was in the middle. I think that the pictures might have represented the beginning of my life through either the present, or through my death.I donĺt know whether or not my appearance aged in the pictures. It would spin, twisting around and unearthing new pictures. As I said earlier, when the last and center picture in the spiral was highlighted, a new and smaller spiral would be formed from where the last one left off. After several spirals went by, each one smaller than the one before it, the last and smallest spiral would roll out into one long picture that read from left to right. There was a feeling of incompleteness when this happened. My life was incomplete.Then my mom would look at me with a solemn expression on her face. It was as if sheĺd foreseen this. Then her head would start rolling around on her shoulders. When I think back on it, I think I remember her floating around the hospital room (which I didnĺt realize was a hospital room at the time) with her head rolling around. Her head rolling was accompanied by an incredibly disturbing noise. Iĺm pretty sure that she had a very discombobulated body. I remember her with a small body, long orangutan arms, big hands, and a huge boggle head. I think that the gray, spirally background was present when this happened. Iĺm not sure if my memory is a hundred percent correct on that part, though.In my insanity, I was filled with despair and hopelessness. Iĺve concluded that this emotion was another mix of very intense negative emotions. It was another emotion that Iĺd never felt before. I would realize that Iĺd been taken by the insanity. This was the dreaded insanity that I had quit believing in so long ago. I hadnĺt even thought about it in a long time. I would start screaming and begging my mom to rescue me from this nightmare. I would scream, ôI love you, mom!ö  I would scream for her to help over and over. Eventually it would stop. Iĺm pretty sure I woke up in bed to find out that it was a dream every time, excluding the last episode. Iĺm not sure of this, but I think I woke up in bed to find out that it was a dream.The episodes of insanity wouldnĺt feel real when I came back to reality, or what I thought was reality. I pretty much forgot about them and moved on. These episodes would repeat themselves every so often. They would gradually start to occur more and more often as time went by. Eventually these episodes of insanity started occurring within a very close time interval of each other. There would be a matter of seconds between them. The pictures of my life were always the same. This was insanity. Insanity was seeing and feeling my existence collapse into itself. It was experiencing a deathlike phenomenon over and over again. It was repetition. All my lives were the same from beginning to end. I did the same things and got the same ending.Looking back at it, I realize that it was true insanity that I experienced in my bad trip. The textbook definition of insanity is repeating the same actions over and over again, expecting different results. That is exactly what I was doing. I always thought that the insanity was over and wasnĺt real when it ôstoppedö for a little while. Then I forgot all about it and went on doing bad things and leading a life full of wrong doing and misdeeds. I continued to think that the episodes of insanity were just nightmares every single time they happened. Even when these episodes went from happening once in a blue moon, to once every few seconds (which took quite a while), I continued to disregard them as just bad dreams. The same sequence of pictures repeated themselves over and over again, getting a little bit shorter each time. Every time I would reach the end of a life, I got a sense of there being two different endings. One ending was a good one and the other was a bad ending. Now obviously I wanted to achieve the good ending, but I never got it. I would get right to the end, expecting to get the good ending every time, however I would get the bad one instead. I got the insanity instead of the happiness. Then I would have to relive my life. I would get right to the end just to see the good ending slip away from me. It was absolute insanity. I kept on repeating the exact same actions over and over again, expecting different results.My life was pretty much a fairy tale. It was actually a series of illustrations that read from left to right. These pictures were on rows. There were rows stacked on top of each other, like lines on notebook paper. This ôbookö was my perception. My personal identity was very different than it is in reality. I was looking at myself from a cross between a second person and third personĺs point of view. I was still me, however I viewed myself through what would seem to be a different personĺs point of view.Throughout my lives, I would feel a form of consciousness watching me. However, I didnĺt think of it as a form of consciousness. I didnĺt even notice it. Looking back, I can see that this form of consciousness was all powerful. It loved me and wanted to help me. Like I said, I didnĺt notice it as a real being, but I remember it being more and more obvious that it was there towards the end of my lives. No matter how obvious it was that this being was real, I simply wouldnĺt see it. I just ignored the obvious and continued on with ôlifeö. The picture I painted was the same every time. I did the exact same things in every life. All of my lives were copies of each other, the length being the only variable.Now as I said, I would try and enjoy each life to the fullest, even though I didnĺt enjoy them at all. I would just do whatever I wanted. However, towards the end of each life, I could almost feel the insanity coming. Even while I attempted to enjoy the earthly pleasures of reality, in the end, the insanity would start to show itĺs signs of coming. Even so, I wouldnĺt catch on to it and I never believed in it until it was too late. It was kind of like the song Karma Police by Radiohead. Itĺs like the very end of the song where it sounds like angels are singing. However, even as theyĺre singing, the sound of cold, hard reality sinks in and eventually takes over, wiping out all that is good.In one episode of insanity, my momĺs head rolling eventually stopped and she asked me, ôWhat did you do?ö Iĺd start begging or say that I didnĺt know. The it would all start over again. Sheĺd keep asking me what I did. Eventually I answered, ôAcid.ö She said, ôMm, thatĺs a bad one. How much did you take?ö  ôFive.ö ôYou took five?ö ôYeah.ö ôWhy would you take five?ö We talked a little and then she said, ôWhere did you get it?ö ôSK.ö ôWhere did you take it at?ö  ôThe Kroger parking lot.ö Thatĺs where I bought it, but itĺs not where I took it. ôHow many did SK take?ö ôFour.ö He really didnĺt take any, but somehow I thought that he had. Then she might have asked me where he was and told me that I should tell her where he was to help him. ôDonĺt you want to help SK?ö ôYeah, help SKö, I said in a trance like voice, although I didnĺt think he was in danger and wouldnĺt have cared if he was. SK was the least of my concerns now. My mom told me that I probably totally messed up my brain and that I was probably going to get like this again easily. I said, ôOh noö, in a distressed voice, but really couldnĺt have cared less. I remember feeling the sticky stuff from the pads on wires, which were attached to my chest. I think I might have ripped some, or possibly all of them off. I thought it was blood and that I mightĺve jumped out my window. I thought I might be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life, a consequence for not listening to warnings about drugs. At least I was alive, though. She told me that I hadnĺt and that Iĺd just had a really bad trip. I was shocked. I asked her, ôSo this was all a trip?ö She told me that it was. I was shocked and almost disbelieving. I couldnĺt believe that a simple drug had been the culprit of this madness. There was no fucking way. Something had happened. That something defied reality. The only problem was that I didnĺt remember a damn thing that had happened to me.HELLI donĺt remember exactly when, but the episodes of insanity might have eventually started up again, probably because I was still being bad. Either that, or some of what I wrote above might have happened at a different point in the trip, rather than before the Hell part. At some point, a special episode of insanity came. What was so special about this episode is that it was the last. I begged my mom to help me out of my mess, just as I had done every time before. She stared long and hard at me. Then she made her decision. She didnĺt want to, but she turned away and gave me the cold shoulder.I never thought she would do it, but finally she refused to bail me out. I had used up all my second chances. Iĺd had so many chances. Towards the end, Iĺd had to beg more and more for them, but my mom had always come through. She was done now. She finally just turned her back on me for good. Everything went dark. It was like someone was closing the curtains to my life, blocking out all the light and everything else that was good. The coffin was closed. She had the power to leave me. Sheĺd had the power to do it the whole time. She hadnĺt done it, though. She hadnĺt done it because she loved me. Iĺd used that love she had for me to my own advantage. Now she was finally GONE!!! Now it was all over. Sheĺd done all she could and she had failed. No, I had failed. Why would she bail me out? Why should she? I wouldnĺt have ever changed. I was doomed. The door was closed. All the light was gone. I was in the dark. I was all alone. I was away from love. I was away from the light. This truly was death.I finally had the revelation. Insanity was hell! Iĺd been too blind to see it until now. There was a Ĺgame overĺ feeling. Iĺd lost the game of life. It was a feeling that was all too familiar. It was the feeling of dying in a video game. It was the feeling of seeing someone else being dealt an unhappy ending on a movie or TV show. But something was different about this. This was happening to me, and worst of all, it was real! This was impossible! This was the end of my life! And it was a horrible ending! Never in a million years had I dreamt this possible. Something wasnĺt right about this. It was like a fairy tale with a bad ending. This wasnĺt supposed to happen. I was dead!As the insanity took me over, I felt my existence end in a number of different ways and dimensions, all at once. I felt my life as an ongoing series of pictures, placed so close together that they ran in one smooth, cylinder that ran on continually until it stopped abruptly in my death. I would see the same sequence of pictures over and over again. These were the pictures that summed up my reality. I found myself in many different crazy places, my body transforming into horrifying, crazy, random things. I think I might get some memories of a few of the crazy things I morphed into, but I might just be fooling myself.I think I might remember my arms becoming tiny little things that lost all use, their only use being to be waddled around like flippers. I am pretty sure that I remember shrinking into nothing. The physical sensations felt unbelievably real. I actually felt the feeling of my body morphing. These experiences were horrifying and extremely out of body. I remember seeing and/or being a shape that I can only describe as a ôsome-number-agonö. I would roll forward, eventually unwrapping myself into a flat picture that I donĺt remember seeing. I also get a memory of feeling an abrupt, invisible force piercing through my body (it wasnĺt painful, but it was terrifying), changing the picture in front of me with each stab. This could have been a branch off of the thought I had in the beginning of my trip, the thought of having soft, easily penetrable skin. Iĺm referring to when I was laying on my bed and my skin felt wet, fragile, and amphibian-like.I can just barely remember a whole shocking array of crazy scenarios and hallucinations. Iĺm not sure of when in the trip this occurred, but picture after picture of me having sex with different girls flashed before me. I observed these scenes as pictures. They were still frames and the scenes changed in a flipbook-like fashion. However, it was different than a flipbook in that the new pictures that replaced the old ones seemed to come from the corner of my vision, flying in to fill their place in the center of my field of vision. The pictures also appeared to me much, much slower than they would with a flip book. My mom was seeing all of the sexual things I had done in my life. She was absolutely disgusted and was saying things like, ôOh my God! Is that you?ö She called me names and was disgusted by the things I had done.I thought of a certain someone I had been incredibly mean to in the past. I thought that this person was going to come and tear me apart over and over again for all eternity. I think that I imagined a hellish picture of this personĺs face. This picture may have had a background that looked fiery, but lacked flames. At some point, my momĺs face changed and I think her nose curved upwards, creating a face of pure evil. In this memory, I could feel a sense of happiness come from this creature. Looking back, it kind of reminds me of Loki, the Greek god of mischief, although I have absolutely no idea what Loki was supposed to look like.Then my momĺs eyes would penetrate my mind and I think her mouth mightĺve curled up into an evil smile. Iĺm not 100% on that part, though. Her head would start rolling around on her shoulders. Her head rolling was accompanied by that bone chilling noise. I felt an ĹI got youĺ type of feeling coming from this creature. I didnĺt notice it at the time, but it was as if someone else was staring at me through her eyes. It was as if that someone was finally coming out of the shadows and revealing itself to me, although I didnĺt realize it at the time. It was the face of true evil. Even though I didnĺt notice this person at the time, the revelation of the existence of this other person that was staring through my motherĺs eyes reminds me of the ending of the movie, ôSawö, when the ôdeadö guy on the bathroom floor turns out to be the guy who set the whole thing up. This entity was torturing me. It tortured me with the energy and savagery of a dog with a kitten in itĺs mouth, chomping down and shaking it like a rag doll. However, it took no energy for this being to do this. It was standing there, savoring every last moment of this. I thought it was my mom, though.My mom didnĺt seem to be enjoying it. She didnĺt want this to happen, but sheĺd seen it coming for a long time. She couldnĺt help me if she wanted to. At some point, there was something that kind of looked like the board from a board game in my field of vision. I donĺt remember much about the bottom of it, but the top was a big oval on itĺs side. This oval had a smaller sideways oval inside of it. There was a pink, slimy, and scaleless, snake-like creature that was wrapped around the smaller oval, yet contained by the bigger oval. This creature took up all of the space in the big oval. This creature had no head, but actually crawled back into itself. It had neither a beginning, nor an end. It was constantly squirming around in itĺs guided path. As it was squirming around, it either felt like it was squirming around in my head, or possibly it may have felt like my head was the worm thing. First it started off as a game that my mom and I were playing. She controlled the creature. She would make the creature squeeze my brain. I mightĺve laughed when it squeezed, but Iĺm not sure. It wasnĺt a steadily tightening squeeze. It would squeeze in increments, one little bit at a time, itĺs grip on my brain growing tighter and tighter with each squeeze. After a short period of time, it was squeezing too tight. It wasnĺt a game anymore. It was torture!I would scream things to my mom. Iĺd yell things like, ôNo, mom! No, please! No, stop! No! Help!ö, my voice getting louder and louder with each sentence. I might not have been saying, ôNoö for all of my first words, or for any of them for that matter, but I think I was. The second words in the incomplete two word sentences would be louder than the ôNoĺsö or whatever the first words were, but both the first and second words got louder as the two word sequences progressed. I would jerk my body to the left or right as I said each word. Hereĺs an example. ôNo.ö I jerk my body to the left. ôPlease.ö I jerk my body to the right. With each word, Iĺd jerk my body to the left or right, depending on which directionĺs turn it was. The first words in the two word sequences were always a bit quieter than the first, however, the tighter the worm squeezed, the louder the words got. The first and second words rose in volume at a proportionate rate. After these sequences of screaming and jerking, I would scream that what I was experiencing was too crazy or intense. After awhile my momĺs head rolling would stop and Hell would be paused. My mom would ask me a riddle. Somehow I knew that if I got it right, I would get out of Hell. My memory is of her asking me a different riddle every time, but it couldĺve been the same one being asked over and over. I never knew the answer, so I would start screaming and begging. I remember miserably yelling out, ôI donĺt knowö at one point. Every time I failed to answer a riddle, my momĺs head would start rolling and the insanity would start back up all over again. My mom told me that I was repeating myself in a sort of echo fashion. ôIĺm dead. Iĺm dead. Iĺm dead. Iĺm dead. Iĺm in hell. Iĺm in hell. Iĺm in hell. Iĺm in hell. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.öShe also told me that I was rhyming, using nonsensical words. I donĺt remember the exact words I said, but an example would be, ôHelp. Felp. Relp. Shmelp.ö  I remembered these episodes of babbling after she told me. She would look into my eyes and her gaze would pierce right into my soul. This stare would pretty much say, ôYouĺve been a bad, bad boyö, in the same way a mother would say it to her child when she caught him or her with their hand in the cookie jar. This might have occurred in Hell or it could have occurred in a previous episode of insanity.Iĺm not sure, but I think that some of the riddles, or at least one of them, maybe the last one would be, ôWho loves you?ö Eventually after what seemed an eternity, I said, ôGod.ö I remember saying it absentmindedly. I donĺt even think that I knew what I was saying. Iĺm pretty sure that I said, ôOh my Godö, or something like that. After saying this, my momĺs head rolling and the horrible visions abruptly stopped. There was a pause. Then she said, ôWhat about God?ö I said, ôHeĺs realö, as a statement and question at the same time. Iĺm not sure if it was my mom or a male nurse that said, ôHe is real.ö I think my mom said, ôAnd he loves you.ö Then the darkness that seemed to consume the hospital room was replaced by a golden light. There was a spiritual light too. The spirit of God seemed to enter the room. I felt a feeling of overwhelming love come from this spirit. This feeling was the polar opposite of the feeling that the creature in my momĺs eyes had given me. Everyone seemed to be happy after that.I think that I might have had the hallucination that everyone was clapping, but Iĺm not sure. Everyone had been in on it. Everyone had known. My mom was either a servant of, or a part of God. Thatĺs why sheĺd encouraged me to do right my whole life. Sheĺd been trying to save me from Hell. It felt like the ultimate reality TV show, a show that everyone had been on, except for me. God had been behind the scenes, directing everything as it happened. It felt like the end of Titanic when Rose was back in the ship with the rest of the crew. I couldnĺt believe what was happening. It was so surreal. In all of my lives, my mom had been trying to teach me lessons on goodness. I had failed over and over, but I had finally realized the truth. All of my lives had come together as one.This strange and unexplained mystery that had been my reality, had finally been unraveled. I get a possible memory of seeing my life as the screens on TV screen-looking cubes, with a scene from one of my previous lives on each one. They were in tall stacks and long rows. Iĺm not sure if that part really happened, though. It all made sense now. There was a right and a wrong, a good and an evil, and a Heaven and a Hell. Being good didnĺt have to be so bad. I said in shock, ôSo this is what this whole thing has been about?ö ôYesö, she said. I remember saying, ôI donĺt believe itö, probably over and over again. Then I said something along the lines of, ôGod is realö, or, ôI canĺt believe God is realö, as an expression of amazement, not a statement that I couldnĺt believe in him. Then some guy (I think it was the male nurse I mentioned before) in the room said, ôSay it again.ö I said, ôGod is real!ö Everyone seemed really happy. I think I said some things that I wanted to do.Then, for some reason I still donĺt understand, I either said, ôAnd we can kill peopleö, or (I think that this is what I said) ôAnd we can have sex with women.ö  I quickly realized that I had said something bad, so I said, ôNo, not thatö, or something like that. The guy said, ôNoö, in the same voice youĺd use to tell a dog, ôNo.ö My momĺs head rolling started up for just a split second, and then it faded away. It didnĺt worry me, though. I knew it wouldnĺt start up again. Everyone in the room seemed to be like, ĹNow he gets it.ĺ The guy asked me what I learned today. It mightĺve been my mom, but Iĺm pretty sure the male nurse. I said either, ôDonĺt take acidö, or ôDonĺt take drugs.ö He said, ôThatĺs right. Donĺt take them.ö After awhile, my mom told me that Iĺd said some embarrassing things.This part seems to be right about at the part where my mom asked me all the questions about SK, although I donĺt remember having had the revelations about God at the time. However, this must have been around that time. Iĺd probably forgotten about the revelation of Godĺs realness. Anyways, fast forward a bit and I was lying on the hospital bed (even though I donĺt think I knew that it was a hospital bed), expecting to meet God any second. I really didnĺt feel like paying attention, but I knew that I should. The moment of revelation was about to come. I was about to get all the answers to life.I was about to find out the purpose of my existence, the reason for reality, and what every life experience Iĺd ever gone through had meant. Then I thought, ĹWhat if Iĺm not ready to be judged? What if thereĺs something else that I have to realize before I go before God? What if I go before him and I havenĺt realized whatever I might have to realize first and Iĺm sent to Hell?ĺ I just felt like lying back and relaxing, but I thought that if I did that, I might end up regretting it for the rest of eternity. The thought of going to Hell wasnĺt scary at the time, but I knew that Iĺd better care now than rather than suffer later. So I started screaming and jerking my arms and legs back and forth, rattling the bed. I wasnĺt scared, but I thought that this might just possibly delay me from meeting God for awhile while I tried to figure whatever it was that I needed to figure out, this being if there was even something to figure out. I remember some nurses around me. They were doing something.Then I said some embarrassing things at that point because I thought that I was about to leave Earth for good. I thought that it was my last second there and that I was about to go flying through a tunnel of light to meet God (which is actually like a dream that Iĺd had a long time ago, except there was no God). Then I realized that my last words were bad, so I said something along the lines of, ôsorryö or ôI shouldnĺt have said that.ö I know that my mom told me that Iĺd said some embarrassing things well after this part, which is contradictory to me having written that this part happened earlier in the Ĺinsanityĺ section. I also donĺt remember any scary parts after the revelation of God being real.Anyways, I donĺt really know what happened first: the revelation that all Iĺd had to do was admit that Iĺd taken acid, or the revelation of God being real. I guess that it doesnĺt really matter, though. Anyways, I donĺt remember talking to my mom about this next part, but I think she mightĺve said that I was going to make a choice. fShe might not have, though. Either way, the way that I perceived this conversation was that I was going to have to make a choice between two things when the time came. I thought that it was probably going to be a decision between me or her dying. At the time, I wasnĺt even looking at her as my mom, so I donĺt think I wouldĺve felt bad about sacrificing her life to save mine, but I thought  I might regret whatever decision I made later. So I made a checkpoint in time that I could go back to if I wanted to change my decision when the time came. I donĺt remember much for awhile after this. EXTRAHere is a jumbled up sequence of events that I am unable to place in any specific part of the trip. These could be parts of Hell, parts of insanity, or merely just other parts of the trip. At one point, I realized that all people ever did was talk. That was all there was to do. It was so boring and so pointless. People just talked their pointless, mortal lives away. This was a revelation. What was there to do? Holy shit! Just talk! Thatĺs it! How could I have never realized this until now? This probably happened somewhere close to the beginning.I also get a memory of feeling an abrupt feeling of some invisible force piercing through my body (it wasnĺt painful, but it was terrifying), changing the pictures in front of my eyes with each piercing. This could have been a branch off of the thought I had in the beginning of the trip, the thought of having soft, easily penetrable skin. Iĺm referring to when I was laying on my bed and my skin felt fragile, wet and amphibian-like. With the memories of the changing pictures I mentioned, I get a physical/visual memory of my life being a large cube that would move forward, stay still for a second, then move forward, right, or left, repeating this action with every pierce/stab. Every time it moved, it left a layer of itself behind. All of the layers would remain where they were shed, however they would still be attached to the cube. The cube would continue to move until it had shed all of itĺs layers, leaving nothing but a flat sheet of paper-like material behind. There might have been a picture on this ôpaperö, but Iĺm not sure. Looking back on it, this cube was kind of similar to the giant cubes in the pyramid level on Mario 64. It didnĺt look like them, but it moved like them. I feel like the cube I perceived was a metaphor for my life. I had blown all my opportunities in life and was now dead, or maybe life was time, and as it went by, my box got smaller and smaller until it was no more. Each time the picture would change and the cube would roll out, I would experience reality in a different point of view. It would start off with my whole life summed up in one picture. With each stab/picture change/unfolding of the square, I would see my pointless state of existence in another way. It would work itĺs way down from terrible and pathetic to nothing more than the state of existence itself. I would become nothing more than the simple ability to perceive the concept of suffering. The concept of this cube may have come from the fact that Iĺd eaten sugar cubes. I was no longer human, but the most pathetic and useless form of post-life. I was better off dead. This whole process would happen in about a second or so.At certain points, I experienced complete and total nothingness. I was observing this nothingness from a point of view that couldnĺt be understood by anyone who hadnĺt experienced it themselves. I only had one sense, and that sense was perception. I was no longer human, nor did I even know what humanity was. This was simply the existence of nothing. This was absolutely nothing at all. It was the entire universe. It was everything that currently existed, everything that had ever existed, and everything that would ever exist. It was absolutely nothing, yet it was something. It was simply reality. After all, how could something exist? That wouldnĺt make any sense, now would it? I as a person, had no existence, however, my state of consciousness, which I didnĺt even realized existed, was proof that nothing existed. I saw many different degrees of nothingness, some more non-existential than others, but it was all nothing. This nothingness was represented by visuals of something that could only be described as antimatter. It was proof that nothing existed. These visuals would form ôshapesö, if you will. I donĺt remember what they all looked like, but I think that either all, or at least some of them, started off bigger and fatter, and got smaller and skinnier until they turned into nothing, like the tail of a lizard. These ôshapesö would unravel and kind of fall apart into nothing. I think that they might have originated from the shape of reality I described earlier. I think that smaller pieces of the shape of reality might have broken off and spiraled off into these pieces of nothingness. Iĺm not sure on that part, but I think that thatĺs what happened. I think that these ôshapesö would either have words written on them, or they would form words. I think I can remember seeing the words Ĺsomethingĺ, Ĺnothingĺ, and Ĺrealityĺ written on many of the visuals I saw in my trip. I might have been shown the difference between something and nothing.Now this following concept could have happened on another trip, but Iĺll write it down anyways. I saw how short life was. Even though it seems long, it is short in comparison to eternity. Another reason that it seemed shorter is probably because I could see the whole thing at once.This next part is something I experienced on a salvia trip well over a year and a half later, but it reminded me of when I first experienced it on my bad trip. There was a ôtempleö of life. It was an amazing structure. I think it was shaped like a triangle. It was everything alive (human-wise at least). It was truly divine. It wasnĺt made of wood or stone. Iĺm not sure, but I donĺt think that itĺs walls were visible. I think I just ôfeltö them with my mind and/or knew they were there. I might have seen them, though. This temple was home. It was reality, the place where people stood in life. This temple was the spiritual home to all human beings. The good people were at the top and the bad people were at the bottom. I think that I was somewhere close to the bottom. I might have started at the very bottom, although I remember ôfallingö to the bottom, probably over and over again. Everyoneĺs place in existence was visible. Iĺm not entirely sure about this part, but I think everyoneĺs lives were symbolized by two halves of triangles, which were right next to each other, almost touching. If the lives of the people werenĺt symbolized by two half triangles, then it was something similar to that. I think that the lives of the people at the bottom were symbolized by cone-like shapes. That may have been the case, or maybe my life was either symbolized as a cone, or turned into one when I hit the bottom. At the bottom of the temple was suffering.This following part happened sometime after I learned that God was real. Sometime in my trip (probably in either Hell or maybe Insanity) I remember being buried in a sense. This is a hard concept to describe, but it was as if the layers of reality were burying me. It was kind of like being buried in the ground, except it was more like reality itself, rather than dirt, that was burying me. It was kind of like what happened to the dinosaurs. It was as if time was throwing layer after layer of dirt over me, which caused me to be further and further underground. However, instead of dirt, it was my own existence (an endless string of pictures from my life) that was burying me, and instead of ground, it was the existence of everything in general. This phenomenon occurred in super fast motion. The layers of time that buried me were almost like cards. What I mean by this is that it happened so fast that it was as if someone was shuffling a deck of cards, allowing the cards (or increments of time) to fall on me, burying me beneath them. I was gone. I was lost to time. I was completely forgotten. It was as if I had never even existed. I didnĺt even know Iĺd ever existed. I didnĺt have any sense of self at all. Ages passed by, but I remained the same throughout all eternity, a relic that was no more than an endless channel of information.At another point in the trip, I started relearning the most basic things about what was good and bad for me. This part that had to do with drugs could have happened at another part in the trip, but I think it happened right here in the Ĺbasic lesson learningĺ part. Drugs were obviously bad. I kept finding the answer to my problem. The answer was, ôAnd this is why...pause, YOU DONĺT DO DRUGS!ö The Ĺthis is whyĺ part was almost like a question. It was as if the voice (or my internal dialogue) that asked it was trying to help me figure out the point for myself, the point being, ôDONĺT DO DRUGS!ö That was the answer to everything. Thatĺs why everything was so fucked up. It made perfect sense. My mom might have been saying that to me, or it may have just been my internal dialog. Iĺm not sure. This whole concept could have also been a branch off of the male nurse asking me what I learned, which is not to take drugs. Anyways, somehow I got it in my head that I had taken a lot of drugs and was permanently messed up from them. For some reason, I would never admit to my parents that I did drugs. This is in real life.I remember admitting to my mom for the first time that Iĺd done acid. It was a huge event. The trip seemed to revolve around nothing before that. It seemed like that was all it was about. All Iĺd had to do from the git-go was admit that Iĺd taken acid. After I told her, I thought about how that wasnĺt so hard. Whenever a big point was made, it would enter my mind in a Ĺmatter of factĺ kind of way. I think that my mom started the sentences, even though she probably didnĺt say anything remotely close to what I heard. If not, it was either a disembodied voice, or my own brain starting the sentences. Itĺs as if either my mom, or a bunch of other people, would say the end of the sentence while I thought it. I think it was probably just my internal dialog, though. Hereĺs an example. Beginning of sentence: ôWe donĺt do that because...ö, pause, end of sentence: ôIT HURTS PEOPLEĺS FEELINGS!ö Now I made that particular example up, but hopefully you can catch my drift. Everything I learned was so basic. It was everything I had learned when I was a kid. Life had been full of these tests, but Iĺd only just now realized it. It had started out basic, kind of like playing a video game. My childhood had been the tutorial level, but now I was older and life was more serious. God had been my guide the whole way through. Iĺd failed to notice Him, but heĺd been focused on me and He wasnĺt going to give up. Thatĺs the reason this whole thing had happened. I saw everything. These were the basic instructions to life. Somewhere towards the end, I vaguely remember my dad coming in for a brief moment. I didnĺt know who he was, but he looked familiar. It was like seeing someone I hadnĺt seen in years. I think he said something about me feeling better and that he wanted me home. Iĺm not sure, though. This concludes the parts of the trip that I canĺt place into the timeline. COMING TOAt some point, I came to. I was strapped down to a bed in a strange room. There was no one in there but me. There was a rippling curtain (rippling from the effects of the drugs) near the doorway, which served as a door for the room. I think that it was open, but I donĺt remember seeing out, so it might have been closed. There were sticky pads that had wires attached to them stuck to my chest. I was in a hospital gown, although I donĺt think I realized it at the time. I didnĺt know where I was or how Iĺd gotten there. I didnĺt remember that Iĺd taken acid and I didnĺt remember anything thatĺd happened earlier. Somehow I got it in my head that Iĺd died and was in a waiting room, waiting for my soul be judged and sent to either Heaven or Hell. I guess that I mostly sobered up after awhile. At some point, this bitch of a nurse told me that I was going to have to piss for her into this bottle thing. I said that I couldnĺt and she said that she was going to have to Ĺgo up in me with a catheterĺ if I didnĺt. Normally I would have threatened to kill her and everyone in the hospital, but I didnĺt get mad. My mom got mad at the nurses and started telling them some of the violent things Iĺd done in my past. My mom put the thing on the bed and I think she went out of the room. It fell out of my reach, so she had to come back in and put it back in reach. After a few tries I finally was able to go. I remember sobering up and my mom reminding me of some of the things I said. I remembered these specific things I had said. Iĺd said these things in the very end of the trip, right before I thought I was about to fly down the tunnel of light. I said, ôSo.ö I eventually realized that I could get out of the restraints by pulling my hands through. A nurse told someone that they were going to need some people to come in and try to hold me down and put me back in the restraints. Nothing happened, though. Behind the bed, there was a syringe hooked up to some tube machine. I took it so that I could stab someone with it if anyone tried anything. I didnĺt know what anyone would try, but because of the catheter comment, I was going to be prepared. I started pacing around the room. I had a blanket wrapped around me. I imagined that it was a white cloak.I heard a security guard say, ôHeĺs still on that shit.ö  I tried to leave the room and the security guard told me that I couldnĺt, since I wasnĺt discharged yet. I started getting an attitude with him. NEXT DAYThroughout the next two years almost, I continued to occasionally remember more and more of my experience, eventually resulting in what I have written here. There are more things that happened, things that I simply cannot put into words. All in all, an intense trip is like a really weird movie or novel where youĺre the main character and all the events rotate around you and your life. There are emotions that you canĺt even begin to comprehend unless you have been there yourself. The day after, I felt a wave of blackness, like a pitch black storm cloud in my memory from the night before. I could hardly remember a thing. I did however remember that Iĺd thought I was in Hell. I didnĺt remember what it was like, though. There was a gloomy, hopeless feeling about everything. I felt like life was meaningless and was of no value.I went to a friendĺs house and smoked some weed. After leaving, I wandered the streets for all of the day and part of the night, all by myself. I felt like my mind had been stretched way to thin. There were quite a few after effects. I had extreme trails that took a matter of seconds to disappear after the motion stopped. They had gone down considerably the next day, but have never fully disappeared, even to this day. They are at their most extreme in the mornings when I wake up.Now when I trip, even with low doses, I break through into the state where I lose touch with reality. Concepts from my bad trip often occur, often without warning. When sober, I notice lots of things in reality that I never noticed. My associative thinking has been strengthened to an unimaginable degree.Believe it or not, I also experience several forms of synesthesia now. Numbers have powers. I associate numbers with people and objects. The numbers go from one to ten (although Iĺve never seen anything past an eight), ten being the highest. The stronger and fancier the person or object looks, the higher the number. Five was my favorite at first. Then it was seven and five. Now itĺs eight. This is known as number form synesthesia. I didnĺt even know that what I was experiencing was synesthesia until I looked up Ĺsynesthesiaĺ on Wikipedia.Also, I have experienced the shape of reality while sober (several times), however these occurrences happened without warning, therefore they were probably just flashbacks. There are plenty of other phenomenon that I experience on a regular basis, however Iĺm tired of writing, so Iĺm done describing them. Even though I rarely use psychedelics anymore (except for DXM, even though itĺs technically a dissociative drug), I have gone on many trips since my bad one, however one trip sticks out more than any of the others. It was on June the 5th of that year. During this trip, I experienced realityĺs shape again. Although I freaked out in the beginning, I didnĺt have to play the game over again. The cycle of the shape just repeated itself over and over again.The highlighted point was that God is real. He always has been and always will be. Reality is what reality is. Reality is a creation of God. Beginning of story, end of story. Sunrise, sunset. And that is what reality is. All is well. I saw the chain of authority. God was at the top. Then there were the government and the police. Then there were my parents, particularly my mom. Then there were teachers and principals at school, which was of course a thing off the past at the time. Everything was a metaphor for God. I had hated and fought authority all my life. Therefore, I had fought God. My parents, school, the law, and all authority I had known, was trying to help me. I know that the law isnĺt trying to help me and I still donĺt respect them at all, but it still exists. Breaking the law results in jail, prison, and other legal problems. When I was a kid, fighting with my parents resulted in punishment, family problems, and other difficulties. Acting up at school resulted in Ĺin school suspensionĺ, getting kicked out of school, and many other problems, which in turn resulted in more problems at home. Getting kicked out of school resulted in no job, family problems, and a shitty future if I didnĺt shape up.The seven deadly sins all bring you down. Lust resulted in STDs, cheating, and broken hearts. Gluttony resulted in obesity, diabetes, heart disease, hiccups, and overall feeling like shit. Greed results in strained and broken relationships, people not liking you, and other people not getting what they need from you. Therefore when youĺre in need, people will be less likely to help you out. Sloth, or laziness, results in you going nowhere in life, which also puts a strain on romantic relationships. Wrath hurts people and can also get you killed. Suicide is also wrath towards yourself. Envy causes you to be miserable and can also lead to wrath by means of jealousy. Pride shows people how stuck up you are, which makes people dislike you. Indulging in one of these sins often leads to you indulging in another, then another, then another, and eventually all of them.All these things have a web effect. Problems in one area resulted in problems in others. Try and think of something you can do that would hurt your life, something thatĺs not on of the seven deadly sins. You canĺt. We are pens and reality is a blank notepad. We could write a good or bad story. It was our choice. We had free will. By ignoring what was obvious and repeating the same actions that constantly got me nowhere, I was getting nowhere. I constantly continued to do these things, though. I was repeating the same actions over and over, expecting a different result. This was insanity. Therefore, I literally made my own Hell. The reason I couldnĺt feel God when I talked to him before, is that I sinned all the time. Sin pulled me away from God. The better I was at obeying him, the more I would feel him. At first it starts off subtle. If a kid behaves badly, he or she is being naughty. As they get older and became a teenager, they became bad. Eventually, they become evil.The whole world was full of signs that pointed to the truth. Movies, television, everyday conversations, and reality in general. Reality was full of subliminal messages. All I ever had to do was listen. God talks through people, through your conscience, through karma, and through cause and effect. The bad guy never wins in the movies (well, almost never). Obviously life canĺt be a coincidence. There are too many things that life couldnĺt exist without. The sun, the Earth and itĺs angle towards the sun, most of the organs in your body, cells, the ability and desire to reproduce etc, etc. Also, if you think about it, could it be a coincidence that you just happen to be the smartest animal on the planet, the only one that knows right from wrong? There are thought to be approximately a million species of animals in the world. Think about even one species. Think about how many flies there are compared to humans. Do you think that you just happen to be the smartest animal, when all around you there are countless other forms of consciousness?Just try to listen and see if you can feel God. It may be hard since your sin separates you from Him, but He gets closer and very easy to hear if you sin less. Itĺs much easier to connect with Him when you trip, although itĺs not necessary. Just analyze reality the next time you trip. See if the whole Ĺcause and effectĺ and Ĺchain of commandĺ thing makes sense. If you go into a trip open-mindedly, youĺll get much better results. Look to find out. Donĺt look to disprove. Now Iĺm no religious fanatic. Iĺm young and Iĺm certainly no square by any means, however I feel a responsibility to put this story out there just in case it saves one person. Now I know that this story sounds a little unrealistic, especially with the description of the incredibly short onset, but I have written down my experience just as it happened. I have not made up, changed, or exaggerated (that would be impossible, anyways) anything written here. Well anyways, I guess this is it, folks. Peace out.Exp Year: 2008ExpID: 82774Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 18 Published: Dec 29, 2012Views: 31,423    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Hospital (36) DOSE:1 hit LSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:145 lbMy LSD experience was the craziest time of my life. Literally.Prior to my first and only LSD experience I had been using marijuana for less than a year and I had tried coke twice, nothing else. I didn't even drink much before this year, I don't even like using pain killers and I don't take any prescription drugs.I probably started doing drugs because I lost interest in following the rules, the established order, that had gotten me nowhere. After college I had no where to go. I was the perfect child and student, nothing exceptional, but nothing bad either.After college I applied for the CIA (this becomes important). After being rejected I decided illegal substance use wasn't a big deal anymore.I then got a job teaching English abroad where I met a lot of other English teachers, people who thought like me, people who were the most interesting, intelligent, amazing people I had ever met. And they were all drug users. It was because of them, and their stories, and their accomplishments, that I decided taking drugs would not screw up my life.I was very close friends with Matt, Al, and Rich by the time I decided to try LSD with them. They had all taken acid, shrooms and other psychedelics before. I trusted them, especially Matt. He was older and more experienced and I was a little in love with him.We jointly bought a sheet with ten tabs on it through Matt's local friend, we'll call him John. Of the ten tabs, I went in on one, John took three, Matt and Al each paid for two and Rich had the last two. John took his three almost immediately, the rest of us were waiting for the right time and place to take them together. It never came, we decided to do what we could and took them the night of Al's birthday, before some of us left the country. It was Monday night, around 11pm.Although I originally planned on only taking half a tab, we all ended up taking extra dosages because the effects took so long to kick in, it was about an hour and a half before we felt anything. Bad idea.I took one tab, Matt and Rich took one and a half, John took one, bought off of Matt and Rich, and Al took two.I was completely unprepared for what would come. I did no research before hand, I hadn't understood what happened to other people when I heard their stories. All I knew about hallucinogens was that you saw things.I saw some great things. Dragons in the clouds, fairies in the bushes, dinosaurs in the cobblestones. It was all beautiful and animated and great. Then I realized that everything I looked at was far and close at the same time, everything was big and small. I felt like I was in one of those model train set worlds.I told everyone this and they just laughed at me. I told everyone I felt I hadn't been properly prepared for this. Rich said that no one ever is. I told them that I felt like I was sensing everything at once, or maybe I was in multiple dimensions at the same time. Rich looked at me seriously for a second and said “yeah, but you can't think like that” and then started laughing ridiculously. Everyone else started laughing too. “That was the perfect man,” Matt said. I didn't understand but I got lost in the visions again pretty quickly.Until I got more and more upset that I couldn't understand anything! When I focused enough to talk again all I could say is “I have never been this out of my mind!” They just kept laughing and ignoring me. And they were playing frisbee! How could they play frisbee when it kept twisting in the air? I couldn't believe that they were tripping too. They were acting normal, just laughing a lot, and not catching the frisbee. At this point I was standing in the middle of the frisbee game, my hands half raised, staring at the dinosaurs moving around, crawling on each other. “I feel like someone's missing.” Rich said. I looked around, realized where I was. Shit. “You're talking about me!” I exclaimed, because I wasn't playing frisbee, and I was the only one tripping (or so I thought). There's no way I can play frisbee in this state of mind, they shouldn't be able to either.I started to cry, because my mind was so fucked and I was pissed that these guys, who were supposed to be my friends, had gotten me into this without proper warning or taking any precautions. What if something bad happened! None of us would be able to handle it, none of us are sober! This was really stupid, I can't understand anything.  That's all I was thinking as I cried in despair. For about half a minute. Then I talked myself out of it. “Okay, this is stupid and useless, I can't act like this around these guys, especially Matt, I might as well enjoy these images while I'm stuck in this state.” “I still feel like someone's missing.” Rich said again. OH, I get it, I need to play frisbee, that's what he's trying to tell me. Playing frisbee was the best idea ever. It was something to concentrate on and it looked amazing. Even if I could never catch the damn thing. It kept twisting, getting smaller and bigger, and entering different dimensions.I couldn't figure out why they would ever stop playing and they kept moving. I couldn't figure out how we got from one place to another. But it didn't matter anymore, it was just fun. We all stopped playing and gathered up. Not sure why. But while we were all huddled together in a group, one of the locals came up to us. He didn't speak much English, he only talked to John. I tried really hard to make sense of the situation. The stranger was trying to sell us a book, he said it was old, really old, he said he was a traveling scholar, just trying to make some extra money by selling it.This is when my mind started to take off. I stopped seeing pretty, fun things. I started getting wrapped up in stories in my head. Paranoia and delusions started here.“Why is he here, now, at this time of night?” was the best I could say to try to help the group realize that this was a scam. I thought they all understood: after all, no one was buying the book. Except John, he kept talking to the guy. And he almost sounded like he was trying to convince us that this book was worth buying.“He's in on it! He got us the acid, he was using his cell phone all night, even though the rest of us chose to turn ours off to avoid freak outs, and he was trying to hide its use. That's why he was so adamant about buying a hit off of us. To make us believe that he is tripping too. He told this jerk where to find us while we are tripping balls! That asshole. Matt sees it, he knows we've been betrayed! He looks ready to kick his ass!” But Matt didn't.Other things happened. I saw people in the shadows, they were cops. Now John was an undercover cop. And then Matt was too. Al, Rich and I were going to jail. Then everyone was undercover but me, I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. That's why Rich kept saying “I feel like someone's missing.” They were all working to bring down a huge drug ring, but they liked me enough that they were trying to find a way out for me.I ended up running away from them, in order to save myself. Now I was alone and afraid. I even threw away my phone after Al texted “call us when ur safe.” I sat down and cried, and thought. I thought about everyone who was involved. They were all in on it. Everyone I had met in this crazy country. But wait, that doesn't make sense. Something else is going on here. Something bigger, stranger. Then it struck me! I was never actually rejected from the CIA. My entire time abroad was a recruitment/training process. I had passed, this was the final test. I was in the CIA!I became really happy, laughed at everyone and everything, everything I remembered about the past I made it fit into the puzzle. Every book I read, every person I met, everything that anyone said to me. It was all a part of some big master plan. I ran around the city looking for clues, playing games, talking to people, entering open doors and climbing on things. All because I believed I was in the CIA, the city I was in had become a movie set, and everyone in it was actors. The city became my playground as I enjoyed justifying everything that had happened in my life. Now all I needed to do was find the way out of this movie set in order to finish this final test. At one point I thought I was poisoned, I thought I might die, but I found an antidote. At other times I thought I needed to strip naked and run into the woods because of something a friend had said. At other times I thought I needed to walk home.Eventually I decided I needed to climb up a brick smoke stack in order to see the boundaries of the movie set and to conquer my fear of heights. One of the guys I hung out with in this city (thus he was in on it too) said that everyone has a fear of heights and being alone. “Not everyone,” I thought, “just me. I need to get over those fears.” It was about 9am now. I climbed up the smoke stack. I got to the top, it was beautiful, I was happy.But there was a commotion below me. The actors on this movie set had brought out a fire truck, presumably to get me down, but I knew it was fake. I climbed back down. There were police there now. I got to the bottom and I knew I couldn't let the police catch me. I ran away. But I wasn't quick enough, they caught me and I couldn't get away. “All right,” I thought, “they wouldn't capture me if I really wasn't supposed to be caught. I need to find another way out of this.” They took me into a nearby building. Believe it or not, the nearby building, the place where the smoke stack was located, the place I chose to climb up to the highest height I could find, was on the grounds of a mental hospital.I didn't think this was strange, I thought the room they took me into was just another set, full of more actors. They asked me if I have ever talked to a psychiatrist. No, I haven't. Oh, I get it, in order to get into the CIA I need to go through psychiatric therapy. They told me I have problems, that I'm depressed, that I have a death wish, that I've had lots of doctors (this, I thought, was referring all of the friends I had met here), that I'm not normal, that I need help. I thought all of this was about the problems I needed to get over, and how I'm special and that's why I'm in the CIA.A lot more happened to me in the hospital. I was there until around 11am the next morning. I was in a mental hospital, I talked to mental patients, I acted completely insane, I was completely insane and I talked to the woman lying in the bed next to me about everything I thought I could consider a mental problem about myself. Except being crazy. The whole time I thought it was a game and/or a test. The test/game was to find a way out after I explored my psych. I was discovering things about myself, but a lot of it was bullshit I thought the CIA would want to hear. Like not wanting to do any more drugs.They had to strap me down and give me drugs (I don't know what) to get me to sleep. In the morning things didn't make as much sense, but the fact that I was there, in this fake hospital, convinced me that everything I had been thinking was true.Eventually I found a way out like a good spy should. I calmly talked to the staff about how I did not belong there, that if I had problems they should be taken care of in my country, that I had no insurance so they should get rid of my free loading. They had me sign a no consent form and let me go.I walked back to my flat, started packing. The only clue left that was left, that I thought was right, was that I needed to go home by getting deported.I hadn't eaten or slept much, at all. I ate, then slept, before actually packing. When I woke up it was because Matt, Rich and Al were outside, making noise, looking for me. They told me they had filed a missing person's report, they asked what happened to me, I lied. I asked what happened to them, I thought they were lying.  None of it made sense. I thought I would never see them again. What were they doing here? I was confused and wanted to be alone, but I knew I needed to talk to them. I did. Only a few times did they say things that I could fit into my story. Nothing was making as much sense as it did before.It was about 48 hours after I had first ingested the LSD. I stayed with my friends, I started to think that maybe, just maybe, I could be crazy. But the hospital. That was real. How could that be?I finally asked to talk to Matt alone. I didn't know how to start, I still thought I should be playing the game, not telling the truth, I'm a spy... I think...“What's up?” he said.“You know how you said that if you're really crazy you won't know it?”“Yeah...”“Well, either I'm crazy, or you're in the CIA.”I looked at him, waiting for someone to finally really confirm everything for me. His reaction was not what I was hoping for.“What? There's no way that's possible.”“Then am I crazy?”“Is that what you're asking me!?”“Okay, let me tell you why I think that. I'm going to tell you what actually happened to me...”I told him. I was convinced. But he just kept shaking his head, and occasionally saying “fuuck” and “LSD is a powerful drug.” I was still trying to convince him. But as I went through my story I occasionally saw myself as other people must've during that time. I got to the end of my story. “None of that was real.” he told me. He had to tell me again and again. We had to go through specific things. “None of it.” He told me.I broke down. It took another day before I was fully out of it. Before I could think straight again.  It's been about a month now. I think it took that long for me to feel completely grounded in reality.I never imagined that I could ever go that far out of my mind. Now I really believe in the value of LSD for psychiatric purposes. I was in a very good state of mind when I took it, the only pressing issue for me has been what to do with my life and I feel like I received some valuable insight about that, at the very least.In the end, I think it was an amazing experience. Amazing. I faced all of my fears, I realized what was important to me, I realized I do not want to be in the CIA, and considering no real damage occurred, I had a great time. I had the time of my life.I feel like I should never do LSD again, my brain and LSD do not seem to get along. But I want to. I want to play frisbee and see dinosaurs and dragons dancing around in the clouds and bushes. Unfortunately, the fear of going psychotic again is still strong and will probably stop me for a long time.Exp Year: 2008ExpID: 73806Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 2, 2013Views: 43,679    LSD (2) : First Times (2), Bad Trips (6), Unknown Context (20) DOSE:7 goralMushrooms(ground / crushed) 4 hitsoralLSD BODY WEIGHT:185 lbAge: 19Date: October 10th, 2011Dose: 7g mushrooms + 4 hits LSDI had done LSD twice prior to this experience, and mushrooms three times. I had tripped quite a lot on 2C-E as well as salvia. I considered myself moderately experienced with psychedelics. I had never tripped very deep, even with up to 75mg of 2C-E. I was very eager to get a really deep meaningful experience. I'd heard that tripping alone would allow your mind to really let go, to not have someone there with you to ground you in reality. Well, from my experience that's completely true.It was the day before thanksgiving. I had just bought 7g of mushrooms and 4 hits of LSD from a friend. I don't really know why I decided to trip that night. It was one of the worst times I could've done it (the day before thanksgiving, lots of stuff to do the next day with family). I initially was going to do it at 9PM but kept putting it off telling myself 'it's not a good time just wait till next week' well by 11PM I decided 'fuck it!'. I took my 7g of mushrooms and ground them to a powder. I used them to brew a mushroom tea. I flavoured it with orange juice and sugar. It tasted pretty good. I took the 4 hits of LSD while drinking my brew. Within 15 minutes I could feel my stomach twisting and turning. Bubbling on the inside. The mushrooms were at work alright. At the 30 minute mark I could see the classic mushroom visuals. I looked at my cement floor, a liquid texture, a lot like a bowl of soup. I had never seen visuals this 'loose' before. I shook my head and the world jiggled like a bowl of jell-o. I spent the next 15 minutes looking at items around my room and shaking my head. I decided to put on some psytrance to get myself in the right mindset.At the 45 minute mark it was only getting more intense. My visuals had taken on a pink/purple hue. I turned off the lights because it was starting to bother me. The colours weren't as noticeable in the dark, but I found it almost impossible to see anything but my t.v or computer screen. My vision was polluted with a fuzzy texture much like that of static on a tv. I spent the next 10 minutes or so trying to get comfortable and fighting the worsening stomach pains. At about an hour in I felt like the LSD was kicking in. My trip briefly took on a much lighter happier feeling. I turned the lights back on and decided to play my guitar. I felt like I was playing some really beautiful stuff, but it was probably just the drugs. This whole time I was still trying to fight the stomach pains, but they were just getting worse and worse. Finally I had had enough, and had to run for a bucket I kept just in case something like this happened.I puked three or four times, but it was strange. Usually when I puke it's very watery, a large amount, and I won't puke more than once. But this was different.... I was puking up very small amount and it was all grey mush. It kind of weirded me out because I had just drank that tea so why wasnt there any water coming out? This sent me into a bad mindset, like something was wrong with me. I stumbled over to my bed to lay down and try to feel better, but I noticed that everything, and I mean everything, was moving. Usually when I trip I'll see things move or scurry along in the corner of my eyes, but this stuff was happening right in the center of my vision. I didn't like that at all. It's like my trip intensified 10x after I had puked. I got into bed, colours flying all over the walls. I felt things crawling up my legs but reasoned with myself it was just my sheets. I tried to keep calm and ride it out, telling myself that fighting it will only make things worse. I knew I was in this for at least 6 hours, so I tried my best to bring myself back to a happy place ... it wasn't working. All I could think about is 'what have you done to yourself? why did you do this the night before thanksgiving? what kind of a drugged out loser does this kind of shit to themselves?'. It was just an endless cycle of that. I jump out of bed and run to my computer. I go to google and type in 'how to stop an lsd trip help me'. I can't even read the words on the screen. I don't know what happened. Maybe it was because I was in such a panic at the time, I have no clue. But it just made no sense to me why I couldn't read simple english words. I had been able to read them my whole life and now all of a sudden I'm no longer literate? At this point I thought I had lost my mind. I was convinced I had gone too far and had permanently wrecked my mind with the drugs I had taken. My mind filled with the voices of my friends and family saying things like 'i told you this would happen' 'why would you do this' 'you idiot' 'you're fucked now'. I pictured myself in a mental institution, locked away from society. My name and face in the paper with the headline: local teen perma-fried. I tried my best to keep my mind off this topic, telling myself everything will be fine it's just a drug and when it wears off you'll go back to normal... but in the back of my mind I KNEW I was lying to myself.I spent what felt like hours trying to calm down. I browsed my favourite sites, justin.tv and youtube. I opened up a stream on justin.tv and saw a guy playing some sort of really fucked up computer game. Everyone was half naked and having sex and there were random things bouncing around... it was nothing that looked familiar to me and this really freaked me out because I didnt know if this was real or I was just imagining this. I looked at the stream's chat and everyone was extremely negative. Saying things like 'go kill yourself faggot'.This really got to me. I kept picturing myself slitting my arms and chopping off my fingers. I couldn't get it out of my head. I was really worried I would actually do the stuff I was thinking... so much so that I had to go grab a pen and paper and write down 'do not hurt yourself!'. It seemed to help so I stuck it infront of my screen so I couldn't look away from it. I went back to looking up how to stop my trip, even thought I knew there was nothing I could do. I guess I got some sort of comfort out of trying. My thoughts only got worse and worse. I was still convinced I had lost my mind and there was no coming back, and that it was not safe for me to be alone as I might hurt myself for whatever reason. I was pacing back and forth in my room for at least 15 minutes just talking to myself. I looked at my clock and it was only 12:45AM. This blew my fucking mind because I thought it would be at least 3AM. That really discouraged me. I knew I was going to be triping for a very long time and if it was going this slow, it was going to be a nightmare.The same process repeated itself. Me thinking I had lost my mind, pacing in my room, telling myself I'd be okay but actually thinking the complete opposite of that. It was now 1:30AM and I had had enough of this. I decided my only option was to go outside. My reasoning was nature would calm me down, I would be okay once I was away from my room. In my state I couldn't really feel my body all that well. I was constantly on tippy-toes and flexing my muscles. The idea of going outside and being okay sparked something in my mind. I started to feel better, no, I felt amazing. I was in a god-like state now. I was untouchable. I sprinted upstairs barefoot and in pyjama pants. I decided to leave my shoes because I simply didn't need such things. Why would someone who is untouchable need shoes to protect their feet or a jacket to keep them warm? In my mind I pictured mountain lions ripping at my flesh, me laying on the ground unaffedted, immortal. I felt such a rush of power, like nothing I had ever felt before, something stimulants and other drugs simply couldn't even touch. I wrote a letter to my family telling them exactly what I had taken and what had happened. I told them I would leave them in peace for thanksgiving, and that I was sorry I had done this. My plan was to leave the house and go somewhere for 24 hours to see if I had lost my mind or not. If I did, I would live the rest of my life in isolation. I know how stupid that is but that's what I thought my options were.I got outside. It was dark but I could see just fine. Colours filled my vision. I live in a quiet little neighbourhood. Mostly older couples with very young children. There's a railroad behind my house that passes through a forested area. I decided I would head for that. I was walking very slowly, like a cat burglar.I could feel the cold cement against my feet with every step. It felt amazing. The feeling rippled through my legs and out of my fingers. I was one with the ground I was walking on. I got to the fence and jumped over it with ease. I had the prowess of a tiger, I felt like I could do just about anything. I finally got the the forest. I found a small clearing and sat down cross legged. I stared at the sky and the trees and felt the wind on my face. It was amazing. All my senses were boosted. Sight, smell, sound, touch, and taste. I cleared my mind and closed my eyes. I saw picture perfect images of anything I wanted. I could think of something and there it was. It was astonishing. I had never experienced anything like this before. I wanted to tell the world how amazing this was. I thought about running to my friends house and waking him to tell him about my experience, but quickly realized how bad that idea was. I then realized I had left a note to my family describing in great detail what I had done... oh shit. I need to get home. I shoudn't be outside in my pyjamas with no shoes on in the fucking forest. I jump up and run home. I don't know how long I spent in that forest but it was starting to get light out now.I get home to find my mother there. She's read my letter and actually isn't reacting that bad. She's mad that I left the house and tells me how stupid/dangerous it was to go out in such a state. I'm amazed that she isn't freaking out right now. Images of my childhood flash in my head, me as a baby, as a child at the zoo, my mother caring for me. Im flooded with emotions and mostly the feeling of love. I tell my mom I love her and give her a big hug.The next 30 minutes or so is spent sitting on the couch talking to my mom. I'm ranting about how money isn't really real, we just chose to believe in it. Time isn't real either, it's all just an illusion. Everything in the world is love, we are all connected. We are all just a mass spirit system. Death is nothing. At this point my mom is starting to get freaked out. I thought our conversation was going great but she's starting to see just how far gone I am. My step dad wakes up. This is where it starts to get bad. He storms downstairs and my mom tells him what I've done. I can see it in his face. Pure disgust. I can see him judging me, wishing I wasn't around. I can hear it in his tone as he talks to me. It eats away at me like maggots on a corpse. I try to put it at the back of my mind. I turn on the T.V and flip through the channels. At that moment something switched in my mind. I unlocked something. Just like the T.V changing channels, so could my mind. I closed my eyes and flipped channels. Opened my eyes and I was somewhere else. It was unreal. I never imagined this could happen. I had read and heard about people tripping and seeing full on hallucinations but thought they might be exaggerating. Nope. This was real. I was teleporting all around the world with the bat of an eyelash. While I was doing this apparently my eyes had rolled back in my head and I had fallen to the ground. I don't remember any of this, just teleporting to different places all over the world. I was having a wonderful time. I switch channels back to reality, I see my mom holding me and singing amazing grace. This sort of chanting puts me into an almost shamanic trance. Her voice multiplied in my head and took over everything. I could hear a high pitched chime in the background that got louder and louder and eventually 'broke' my mind. It's really hard to explain, but that's the best way I can describe it. Now everything is quiet, my mom is saying things like 'ok just be quiet you'll be alright'. I try to be quiet, but something isn't right. I have a feeling of pure anger and hate inside me. I'm seeing blown up babies, burned women and children, chopped up people, rapes, wars. Everything bad in the world is coming at me right now. I can feel the pain of every human being on this planet. I'm reminded of what I  earned about buddhism, the noble truth that life means suffering. I'm overwhelmed at this point. I dont have my eyes open and I don't remember much but I'm told that I flung myself onto the table where I landed onto a drinking glass and smashed it. This really scares me because that could have killed me... luckily I didn't get cut by the glass. This is really out of the ordinary because up until this point I've never been out of control like this. Not even overly drunk. I'm usually very good at that. Well my step dad had had enough and he phones the paramedics to get me.On the phone I guess they heard me screaming in the background and because of that they had to bring the police as well. Well I had no idea this was happening so out of nowhere a bunch of cops and paramedics walk in and it's just the ultimate mind fuck. I can't describe what I felt at this time. It was basically a confirmation that everything I was experiencing was just in my mind, because why else would a bunch of cops and paramedics be in my house? With this 'knowledge' that it was all a dream and I was really not in any trouble at all I felt fucking fantastic once again. Now it was all a game. I had unlocked some sort of cheat code for my mind. They strapped me to the trolley and wheeled me out to the ambulance. I remember the ride in the trolley. It was unreal. I felt like I was dead. Like I was a corpse in a coffin being carried to their grave. Inside the ambulance I was just fucking with them because I thought it wasn't real. I kept asking them where we were going (obviously not the hospital because this was in my mind). I was convinced we were going to Egypt. I was so excited! I've always wanted to see Egypt. I told them all how amazing it was going to be and how I couldn't wait till we got there. They played along and told me we'd get there soon.Now I'm in the hospital, and I realize I have cuffs on. Not only that but they are really tight and hurt. Quickly I see that this is real, and I'm handcuffed, naked, and tied to a bed. What happened to me? I quickly change my tone from happy go lucky to 'wtf is going on?'. The nurses don't pay much attention to me. They say the cuffs are for my safety. I plead with them and tell them how I would never hurt anyone. This continues for a long time. They stick a urinary catheter in me (ouch) and pump something into my blood with an IV. Now I feel like shit. I'm so tired, my muscles ache, and I can;t sleep. I'm still tripping really hard. I can see waves of colour flowing across the hospital sheets and morphing of the walls. My mom and step dad come to see me. They're really shaken and tell me what I've done. I'm extremely embarassed and sorry this happened... I'm told I have to talk to a psychologist before I'm allowed to leave. We talk, everything checks out, I leave at 7AM. I got no sleep that day, and stayed up to eat dinner with the family. We don't tell anyone what happened, only my mom and step dad know. It hurts when I lift my arms. I have deep purple bruises all over my arms, neck, ribs, back, and stomach.I haven't touched any psychedelic since that experience and doubt I will for a long time. It really opened my eyes. I thought I knew what I was getting into but I really didn't. I made lots of mistakes that night. Number one being taking it the day I did. I was not in the right mindset and it was almost 100% that it would  turn into a bad trip. Second mistake was tripping alone. I think if I had a friend with me this could have all been avoided. My parents didn't know about my drug use before this. They thought I only smoked pot once a week. I told them I only took 2 hits of acid and it was my first time doing it. I have only told one of my friends about this experience and don't plan on telling anyone else because it's pretty embarassing. I guess I'm just posting this because it's an interesting story and it's nice to get it off my chest/talk about it? If you read this whole thing, bravo.Exp Year: 2011ExpID: 95024Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 19 Published: Feb 8, 2013Views: 43,578    Mushrooms (39), LSD (2) : Hospital (36), Overdose (29), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:2 bowlssmokedCannabis(plant material) 2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)   smokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:205 lbThe whole situation started immediately after I got off work. I headed over to my buddy's house with the intent of doing some acid for the rest of the evening. He already had his hit, so we smoked a few bong packs and headed off to grab mine. After a short drive, and a small waiting period, I was sitting in the car with my buddy, my dealer, and my dealer's friend.  [Erowid does not condone or support operating any vehicles while under the influence of any substance] Initially, I had only intended to do one of the four hits I had bought. But, in the heat of the moment, I decided to pop two of them. Now this wasn't my first time doing acid, and typically my trips have followed a flow much like life does. Initial feelings are bubbly and lead to a slow degradation eventually ending in a very thought-provoking state of gentle visuals. As this was the same acid I had experimented with only a week before, I decided that I wouldn't need to mentally prepare myself or be wary of the acid. I was completely confident in my ability to handle what the drug would throw at me.We picked up some more greenery and headed back to my buddy T's house. There we smoked a few more bowls out of my 4.5' bong, and sat down to play some games. It was at this point that my trip began. A mild body high set in, sitting on top of the heavy buzz I had from the pot. Noticing my euphoric state, my dealer decided it would be funny to start messing with me (I was, after all, the only one on more than one hit). Everything I said, he questioned. Everything I did, he mocked. After a few short minutes of this, I felt my mental state drop to one of rejection. I tried to focus on the game, and maybe cheer myself up before I started to get heavy visuals, but I couldn't seem to focus and was continuously losing. After a mild frustration began, I suggested we smoke again. We did so, and my visuals started to take hold. I kept control for a while, focusing on the positive aspects of the trip and the fact that my work day was over, but I started to feel like my trip lacked focus. Engrossed by this thought, I suggested multiple times that we go for a walk to enjoy nature and see the beauty of Earth under the influence of acid. My requests were ignored, not even answered, and I felt the solitary feeling of rejection return.At this point my trip became very negative. The four of us had migrated into my buddy T's room, and I was starting to feel a mixture of rejection, frustration, and cabin fever. I became antsy, impatient, and silent. I stopped paying attention to the myriad of thoughts floating through my head and focused on when my dealer and his friend would leave so me and my buddy could go on a walk and straighten our trip out. My dealer's friend decided he would leave my dealer with us, though, and was asking for a ride when I noticed my first negative visual. His face had contorted, and become old. His eyes sank into his head, and his skin drooped from his bones. I stared for a while, not sure what to think, then decided that I was starting to have an issue. I laid back and looked at the ceiling, hoping to find something intellectually stimulating in my visuals on the wood.After a short time of spacing out into my own head, I sat up to find that my dealer's friend was now gone, and nearly an hour had passed. I looked outside, noticing the sinking sun, and my eagerness to move about returned. I grew more antsy, and once again suggested a walk. My dealer refused, but my buddy T agreed. The three of us got as far as the end of the driveway before my dealer convinced T that walking at night on acid was a bad idea, and we turned back.After getting so close to leaving the house and being pulled back, I started to hold negative feelings about the whole trip. Around this time, I started to peak. My dealer's grin split wide and his teeth turned to fangs. My perception of the world around me distorted, and I felt as tall as every room I was in. Everywhere I looked, things seemed more and more foreign to me. I felt like I was starting to lose control of my trip, so I suggested we smoke another bowl to calm down. After we did so, my dealer and T decided to get food. I agreed, thinking that maybe leaving the house would make things better for me.We got in the car, and I kept insisting that my dealer drive. He was the only one not tripping, and I felt like it would be a better idea. Once again, I was ignored.  [Erowid does not condone or support operating any vehicles while under the influence of any substance]  I got into the back seat and tried to focus on my visuals to take my mind off of my rising feelings of rejection. Suddenly, as we hit the road, I peaked hard. My buddy went numb, I lost my depth perception, and every light was a different color of the rainbow. My buddy T's skin had turned orange, and the inside of his car kept changing shape. I had never experienced such intense visuals on just two hits before, and panic started to rise in me. I managed to calm myself as we approached the Burger King, but it was difficult to control the intensity of the visuals I was having.As we were driving back, I noticed that I couldn't understand a word my buddy and dealer were saying to each other. I felt like I hadn't spoken in years, and the English language seemed to have slipped my mind. This was the first thing that truly frightened me, and made me think that something was really wrong with my trip. As we pulled back into the garage, my visuals stopped making sense and my thoughts became jumbled. There seemed to be too many of them for my brain to handle, and I started to feel like it was overheating. I realized, as we stepped out of the car, that I  had my vehicle here and was definitely not driving it back. I tried to ask my dealer to help me out by driving my car for me so I could get my bong, two other hits, and myself home in one piece. My request frustrated him, though, and he rejected it.We walked inside, and my buddy T went to go talk with his parents for some reason. I still could barely understand what anyone was saying, but I saw him walk into his mother's room. Looking around the house, I realized that I had no idea where I was. Quickly I reminded myself, and tried to strike up a conversation with my dealer. He turned to me, and suddenly the room shrank. He grew, though, and had to crouch to prevent his head from hitting the ceiling. His skin turned green, and he smiled a mouth full of fangs at me as he raised a knife in one hand. I looked away, closed my eyes, and strange visions passed over my eyelids. Two badly drawn birds were screaming gibberish at each other. I quickly opened my eyes and noticed my dealer was still nonchalantly talking to me. The knife in his hand had become a spoon, and his skin had returned to normal.I was starting to get really worried that my trip was going to continue to go badly. I sat down and stared at the coffee table, trying to get a grip on myself. Slowly, I managed to calm myself again. I smiled and looked up at my buddy T, who was standing by the fireplace. Out of nowhere, the bricks on the fireplace started to move and shift. Interested, and no longer worried, I looked closer. I stifled a scream as I noticed the bricks were made entirely of gray snakes. One of them looked at me with purple eyes, and I stared transfixed for several minutes before looking away in fear. I decided to watch the television, but since I still couldn't understand English very well, it held no interest for me. Instead, I tried closing my eyes for some interesting visuals, but opened them again when the first thing I saw was my own eyes burning out of my skull.I decided right then and there that I was having a bad trip and needed some help to be brought down to a better mental state. I wasn't sure how to voice it, though, and ended up turned to my dealer and saying 'I'm not doing so well. I'm not doing so well at all.' I had expected some sort of helpful response from him, since we were old friends and he had sold me the acid. Instead he just stared at me, and nodded. I looked away and up at T, hoping he heard me. But he was laughing at the TV for reasons I didn't understand. In a moment of sanity, I decided that the only way off of this bad trip was to make it good. I focused on positive thoughts, and my mental state slowly improved. I turned back to my dealer, told him I was now okay, and he nodded again.But I was unfortunately wrong. My bad trip came back to me, and I once again voiced my need for help to my dealer. He instead said he wanted to go sell a bag, and asked T to drive him out to do so. I felt like another drive wouldn't do me any good, so I mumbled that I was going to go in the basement and try to find my mind. I descended the stairs, ignoring the visual of an eagle in the light fixture, and sat on the couch wrapped in blankets. I sat for a few moments before my trip suddenly got even worse.There was another fireplace in the basement, directly across from me, and made from the same brick as before. As I stared, those bricks also became snakes, and the snakes stared at me with hungry eyes. I looked down at the ground to avoid their gaze, but noticed that the carpet was no longer solid. I was shifting and sinking, like quicksand, and I quickly abandoned my shoes to keep myself safe. I decided that if I balled up and just tried to go to sleep, things would get better. But every time I closed my eyes, I died in a different way. Once I turned to stone and shattered, once I exploded into mist in the vacuum of space, once I was eaten alive by a beetle. After several of these visions, I laid down to try and focus on relaxing. But my vision didn't seem to work when I was laying down, and everything looked so intensely different that I forgot where I was again. I sat up, and noticed that the whole room had changed sizes. Near me, everything was large, but farther away it was tiny. I rationalized to myself that that wasn't the case, it was just the drug, but lost control when I couldn't seem to move my legs. My body felt like it had frozen solid, and I started to panic. I couldn't yell for some reason, so instead I just repeated my name and address to myself over and over.After several minutes of repetition, I no longer remembered who I was. My sense of self had vanished, and my body seemed to be moving on its own. I was a consciousness trapped inside a foreign body, and I felt so helpless that I decided it might be a good idea to head to a hospital or at least consult someone who wasn't on drugs. I managed to steer my slightly less numb body upstairs, but stopped when I noticed two Chimeras standing in my path. One arched its back, while another raised its tail and hissed at me. I whimpered, stepped back, and put my hands up to protect myself. After a few moments of silence, I lowered them and noticed that the Chimeras were really T's cat's. I wandered down the hallway and into T's room, where I once again forgot who and where I was, and what I was doing in this alien house. After what felt like an hour of sitting and falling in and out of myself, T's mom came by the room and asked me where T and my dealer had went. I said I had no idea, that I didn't even know where I was. She said that they had been gone for several hours, and in another short moment of sanity I remembered that I wanted help. I asked her to give me a ride home, that I was having a bad reaction to some drugs, and I was afraid for my own mental well-being. She obliged, and returned me to my house.After several hours of sitting on my couch staring at a candle that looked the size of my head, my trip finally wore off and I fell asleep sitting up.The next morning, I woke to find that everything still looked mostly foreign to me. I went through the events of the night before, and realized what went wrong. Had I mentally prepared myself, the trip would have been very awesome and very intense. Instead, I let myself slip into a negative state of mind and the trip went downhill from there. I don't feel any negative after-effects since, and still have my other two hits of the same acid to take at my own leisure. I feel as though next time ought to be better, as I know that it was all in my head and created by me. I had nothing to fear but myself. After talking with T a day later, I found out that he had no idea I was having a bad trip. He was so engrossed in his trip that he didn't even hear what I was saying. The reason for my dealer's lack of aid still is unanswered, and I'm still missing several things from that night (a lighter and my wallet with sixty bucks in it). But all-in-all, I feel as thought it was an educational experience for me. Now that I know what a bad trip is like, I feel as though I can conquer one should things ever go wrong again.

I couldn't grasp any normal thoughts, my mind felt like pudding and it seemed that I needed to mold it into something new. I woke up on October 3, 2009 just like any other day, my friends parents were out of town and there was going to be a party that night. We had to pick up one of my friend's brothers, so we drove with his other brother and began smoking in the car. I was feeling pretty comfortable, and we continued smoking after we picked his brother up. We were driving around until about two and came home about two thirty. We hung out for awhile and then around four we went out and smoke with a guy who was selling some bud. We sat and smoked casually for awhile. Then at about 6 a guy showed up with a bong, two giant jugs of liquor, about 300 dollars for weed, and acid. Me and him smoked for about an hour talking about weed and how he had taken six hits of acid, it made me a little uncomfortable at first but I became fine with it. He promised to match me for whatever he smoked, and offered me a cigarette and acid. I declined both but told him I would talk to my friend about the acid, and I might take him up on it.On October 3, 2009 around seven to eight o clock I took three hits of acid which was red on one side and white on the other. The first hit my friend and I did together when we where at a party and a kid offered it to us. My friend had been wanting to do acid for awhile, but I was apprehensive because I had read about it and knew how it could fuck people up. I knew about how people could get bummer trips and how they saw people decompose and thought bugs were eating them and under their skin. My friend eventually talked me into it and we took the hit in the bathroom, the kid had left two hits beside the candle. We ripped the small piece of paper in half and stuck the other half in out bags of weed. About 20 minutes later we decided to take the other half hit. Then maybe another twenty to thirty minutes we asked the guy who had brought the acid for another hit, we had no idea what this entailed. He told us to chill and wait for the trip to come to us but we were too impatient by that point and insisted on another. He gave it to us. After an hour and a half or so of smoking massive amounts of chronic I begin to feel a slight tingling around the edge of my vision and mind, I take no real notice of it and just think it is the many bowls of chronic that I have had. The guy who had given us the acid was sitting across from me and we were discussing about him matching me for what he had smoked with me earlier. Everyone thought I got a little too much but he was fine with it and we continued to smoke. Ten minutes later the guy was pretty messed up because he had taken six hits of acid and was really aware of anything. His little folded up gold foil that held his twenty five hits or so of acid was right in front of me. Everyone was extremely high and no one was paying attention to me so I unfolded it and took out another hit and stuck it on my tongue. After a few minutes of trying I got my friends attention from the opposite side of the table and stuck out my tongue to show him the little tab. His eyes bulged and he tilted his head and gave me a strong look, questioning where I got it from. I asked him if he wanted one and he smile and nodded. Another poor decision on our part.We continued to smoke ridiculous amounts, I was clearing bowls in 3 or 4 hits which were massive and I am still unsure how my body and lungs were able to keep up. My friends and I continued to smoke one of the older guys who had also dropped acid I remember talking to, his eyes were buggy and completely dilated. I remember talking to someone else and he was just watching me and I could tell he didn't approve of me taking the acid. My friend's older brother thought we were idiots but didn't do much of anything else. The kid who actually gave us acid got lost in the kitchen for about an hour, and the kid I was talking to began to have a conversation with one of the dogs. I began losing track of time and I don't really remember much more around this time, this is when the world I was currently was peaking and the magic was getting strong. I sat down with the older kids, ate some pizza and they began to leave and go home.Finally the party wound down and it was just me and my friend, things were picking up now and I could see and feel the magic of the world around me. My friend was just staring into space while we were smoking and kept repeating 'I have no idea what is going on right now'. This was just the beginning though, I had no idea what the night had in store for us. My friend and I went to finish up the weed. When we were smoking all of a sudden we burst out with hysterical laughter and I dropped my favorite piece, the brown bubbler that I have bought in Mexico. When the piece shattered to the ground I felt like part of me was lost and all of my memories getting high with my close friends were gone. Part of me fell to the ground and broke that night along with my bubbler. My friend gaped at me and just said, oh no you didn't just break your bubbler. I was extremely disappointed but I was willing to accept the fact, and felt like it was a good time for it to end and I would get a bong soon to show my experience with smoking. I cleaned it up and chucked the remains into the woods.I told my friends what had happened but there wasn't much of a reaction from them because of the gratuitous amounts of bud that had been consumed earlier, and they weren't heavy weights like my friend and I. I didn't really have a clear emotion or reaction about it at the time either because I wasn't sure what I was thinking now. I planned on going to bed soon, because it was around twelve and had been tripping for several hours. When I was walking down the stair to try and fall asleep my friend asked if the acid was all weird and fucking with me. I responded no and he became tense and said it is with me. I told him to just try and sleep it off and he went into a closet full with blankets and tried to sleep. I slept outside on the couch for a little but I was worried about him and his words were starting to get to me. I got up and asked if he could sleep. He said he wasn't going to be able to sleep and asked if he got a bummer and if he was fucked up and if he was a fuck up. I tried to find his older brother who had some experience with acid. I took me five minutes or so to realize that he wasn't home. We went up into his room and lay down and I tried to make sure he wasn't going to do something stupid like jump out a window.This is when the transition period began, right around two o clock. I felt like I was being nudged out of this world and was stuck in between planes. It was although the world around me was like the black and white static roar when you turn on a tv with no antenna. My friend was still acting strange and uncomfortable. He seemed pretty immobile though so I left to try and sleep in the closet. His word of 'am I a fuck up' kept ringing in my head as I sat in between two strange worlds. I went back up to check on him and he was still scared, I laid down and acted like everything was fine to try and calm my own nerves.I remember getting up and looking at my friend in the dark room and then the acid turned on me. It was only for a few seconds, but my friend grew fangs and claws and seemed to snarl at me, his flesh decomposed and I saw bubbles under my skin like something was underneath them. Some survival instinct took over and shut it down before I could react though, I remember reading about how fucked up people got on bummer trips and I think that implanted whatever saved me into my brain.I laid down beside him and told him we need to just roll with it, he replied after a few silent seconds of tripping 'this sucks.' I am not sure how much time had passed, I think it was an hour of so, but even when I closed my eyes I could still feel the static around me. It was like the craziest party that you could ever imagine and it was on a roller coaster.Finally I emerged into the passage to the other side. It was being flown along with thousands upon thousands of images and sound and scenes from the world. Knowledge was being poured at an astounding rate into my brain it felt like my eyes were wide open and everything the world had to offer, all experiences, weather they be painful, miraculous, or boring, flowed into my mind and remained branded there. I saw everyone I have ever cared about, know, or loved. My entire life was dissected before my eyes and shown to me from a different view point. During this time, the trip had become so intense that I clung to the side of the bed and had to tap it to remind myself I was still really in this world. I became an individual who was able to understand everything and was granted access to the other side. I remember a world around me with mountains to my left and a stream to my right. Then I was running through the world exploring as much as I could with my limited time. The other side is impossible to describe in other words, it is the essence of peace and beauty, I can see why some find it so enticing and want to go back but at times it seemed eerie and surreal. I remembered my friend and the thought threw me back into the static dimension which allowed me to come back and grasp reality for a few brief moments. His breathing was ragged and sounded awful, it scared me a little but he seemed to be okay now. I glanced over at the clock I am pretty sure it read four-twenty one. I moaned and looked out the window and saw a light cresting the horizon. I looked back at my friend and he hadn't moved. I decided to crawl back downstairs and into the closet.Before I closed the door though I remember my vision became swirly and certain colors were out of place. I remember looking down and saw that the blanket that I had over me had morphed with my body. The fabric of my being had combined seamlessly with this blanket, my skin, muscles, bone structure, had all been changed and I became a unique creature. I wasn't able to tell if I was uncomfortable with this or awe stuck by it. When I went back to being displaced in the limbo static world, the time I was there decreased each time I went to the other side; I had to put my hand on the nearest wall so I would know I was still real. Then I shut my mind down and re entered the other side, not sure if I would be able to make it back or not.Six hours later my mind snatched a brief moment of opportunity for thought and heaved itself back into the real world. I felt as if I had been reborn and had a second shot at life. I went up and woke my friend, he didn’t say much.Later that day I went to a baseball game, I had about four hours to examine and lay out my life, try and mold who I am, who I used to be, what part of me got left behind on the other side, and who came back.I realized that I had to be an extremely emotionally strong person to endure the 6 hour trip in the closet, I thought I should slow down on the drugs, stop smoking until I get my bong; let my crazy high tolerance go down. It seemed like the right thing to do.Exp Year: 2009ExpID: 81907Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 14 Published: Dec 9, 2013Views: 3,909    LSD (2), Cannabis (1) : First Times (2), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:   LSDBODY WEIGHT:170 lbBack in the day, like most kids in high school, the only thing that really mattered was what were we gonna do on the weekend and how fucked up were we gonna get doing it. We were your average suburban stoner kids who never really took school seriously and did just enough to get by and keep our parents off our back so we could go out and get wrecked each weekend. Even at our relative young ages, we were all pretty experienced with hallucinogens having eaten mushrooms, acid, and MDMA several times. Whenever we couldn't find a house to party at, or if it was a nice night and we just wanted to chill outdoors, we'd head to this hill way up in the woods a town over from ours and party up there. We'd had numerous fires and parties up there without anyone ever bothering us, plus being on a hill we figured we had a tactical advantage against the police in the event they did ever try and sneak up on us (we weren't the smartest kids, this was our actual thought process). On this particular weekend there were some really killer hits going around and a group of us decided that we'd trip out in the woods for the night, nothing that hadn't been done before. Some other friends of ours wanted to roll so they all got E's and ate those. Right about sunset we all ate our drug of choice for the evening, 5 of us tripping, maybe 8 or so rolling, and headed out into the woods. It was a good mile and a half hike into the woods and up this hill before we reached the spot so by the time we all got up there everyone was starting to feel a bit different. The rolling kids set up shop on one side of the fire, loudly talking and laughing, telling everyone that they loved them, typical rolly-polly stuff. The 5 of us trippin kids on the other hand were on the other side quietly staring at the fire as if we were watching Jesus Christ himself rise up from it. One of the rollin kids must have caught sight of this and made an observation of how funny it was that all the rollin kids were on one side of the fire and all the trippin kids were on the other. At this point I was tripping hard, the fire was coming up and looked to be kissing the tops of the pines above me. And on the other side of the fire, my good friend who made the observation about the division in the group looked so devilish. I told this to another one of the trippin kids and he tended to agree with me, we just had it set in our head thaat our good friend at this time was Satan himself and we'd do best to avoid him for the rest of the night. Of course avoiding a rollin person your with is like avoiding taxes, they're gonna be there right in your face if their fucked up enough. And sure as shit all these kids are rollin face on 3 or 4 pills each, meanwhile the 5 of us trippin kids are looking at them in total fear as they continue to converse about how funny it was that they were all over on one side and we were on the other. I was to the point where I just wanted to get up and pop one of these fuckers in the face for being so weird and others I was with were in total agreement. We began to conspire and talk about the distrust for people that on any other Friday would have been our best friends but now seemed like mortal enemies.By now two of our other friends had come up with a 30 pack between them. What a sight we must have been, 8 kids rollin their faces off, not shutting up and then us the trippin kids huddled together plotting our revenge on these annoying E-tards. Naturally all the rolly kids wandered over and greeted our new arrivals with hugs and other assorted pleasantries while I and my group of geeked out kids with heads full of acid just looked around in wild amazement at the world around us. We must have looked like the lesser of two evils because my two buddies brought their beers over towards our side of the fire and sat down with us. One of my friends asked me what was wrong with the other side of the fire and I said something like 'they're rollin face, we're thinkin about doin somethin'. That must have been an odd response because my friend promptly asked what we were all doing and was a little bit pissed off to find out he had dragged his ass a mile and a half into the woods to hang out with a bunch of really f'd up kids. He cracked a beer, tossed one to the kid he came up with and chilled with us for maybe 15 minutes before it became way to much for them to deal with and they got up to leave. I took this as an opportunity to get away from the madness of the scene at the fire and walk down with them to get my head straight because by now the constant attention from the rollin kids was really fuckin with my head.The three of us all walked down to the cars and my two friends turned to me and asked me what my plan was. Plan? What plan? I just needed to get away from the fire, now I need a plan? The horror of the situation quickly showed itself as I was faced with a decision, either I leave and get a ride home with one of them, totally fucking up my plan to trip out with my friends for the night and need to explain to my parents why I was home a hen I told them I was staying at a friends house. Or I face the terrifying ordeal of walking back through those woods by myself trippin balls. I sat and thought of this dilemma for a moment and decided that the woods, which I knew very well even at night, posed less of a risk than my parents did so I decided to hoof it back up. I watched the cars drive away and was all alone at the entrance to the path.It was really a strange realization that I had entering the woods, I wasn't really scared or freaking out, but I became increasingly aware that the path looked a lot different. I felt myself begin to panic a little bit but just told myself that I was fine and to just start walking. I walked and walked and walked for what seemed like forever. The woods all around me, dark as could be in the dead of the night were absolutely alive with energy. All these shapes and colors were all around me and I struggled with myself to block it all out and focus on the path. What seemed like an eternity later I stopped and really had a frightening moment with myself. Had I screwed this up and was now lost? Nothing looked familiar but from the second I entered the woods nothing had looked familiar. I looked around to try and catch a landmark, something that would trigger a response to let me know I was safe. I spun around which only confused me further, which way was I facing now? I was tripping harder than I ever had before, alone, lost in the woods...not good. Full blown panic swept over me and for the first time I felt the fear, I might never get out of this. They'll have to send search parties looking for me when I turn up missing and they'll never find me, I'm that lost. It was the single most frightening thing that has ever happened to me. Just then I heard voices not to far off from my right. I spun around and there was the fire glowing off just a little bit in the distance. Phew, I'm gonna make it. I started to walk...and walk...and walk and the fire never seemed to be getting any closer. Uh oh, what's this all about. I stopped to see if I could hear anything and to relief I could hear voices in conversation just out of range to make out what they were saying. Ok, good. You're just playing tricks on yourself, the fire's right there. Relief. I started walking, cheering myself on, the fire was just ahead and I'd be safe. I stopped myself again. This was getting crazy, I'd been walking for God knows how long and was sure I should have been at my destination by now. The panic came over me again and was absolutely sure I was lost. What am I gonna do now? Ok, relax and think. Let's retrace your steps and head back towards where you came from and figure it out. If you can get out of the woods, catch your bearings and figure out what's going on you'll be able to take another crack at this or at the very least wait for everyone else to come out of the woods. I started along away from the fire and the voices and started trekking towards the way I came in (I hoped). It was the most difficult thing in the world to ignore the sounds from behind me, always behind me. It was like something was pulling me deeper and deeper into the abyss and it took every ounce of my strength to fight it. By now I was in total panic, scared to death that I was never going to make it out of this. Everything around me was just negative energy. I felt a million eyes staring at me, evil eyes that wanted to hurt me. Fight it, keep walking, it's all in your head. Flashes of light all around, jumping from tree to tree. The sky looked of liquid, like you could jump in and use the moon like a beach ball. Normally this would be quite the sight to see but in my panicked state all the beauty was lost. I could do nothing but force myself through this total fear and trudge onward into this laser light show in front of me. I would hear the voices behind me, by now it seemed as they were begging me to turn around, the safety of the fire was just a few steps away. Fight it, it's not real, just keep walking. This was the most intense experience ever and it was getting stronger and stronger. The voices were louder, it looked fire balls were raining down all around me and the sky was a giant mass of black liquid. Holy shit, I've gone completely sideways. I'm not gonna make it out of this, I'm doomed. Total panic.I heard the sound of rustling leaves and breaking sticks close by me. What the hell is that? Holy shit somethings been following me? I ducked behind a tree, trembling in complete morbid fear. Voices grew louder and the sounds of walking came closer. What the hell has been following me this whole time? What the fuck does it want? I heard a voice say my name, holy shit it knows me. I saw the figure come out from behind a tree and start walking in my general direction, several other figures weren't far behind it. Surely they couldnt see me behind this tree but they were closing in. I wanted to flee, the urge to run overtook me. I took one step and the figures now seemingly with in arms length away stopped. 'What the fuck is that' one of them said. Guys! I exclaimed. 'Holy shit dude, we've been callin you a bitch for bailing on us for hours now. You just up and bailed on us without saying a word when the other two left' I was relieved, I had found my group who was on their way out of the woods. I was at the very entrance of the path and didn't even recognize it. Had I dilly dallyed just a few minutes longer with my decision to get out of there when I did I would have missed them and who knows what the outcome would have been. I was just relieved to know I was safe. Moral of the story is, watch out what drug people you mix. E and acid are awesome as a combination for one person but two people on either substance, not so fun in my experiences.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 88520Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 16 Published: Jan 21, 2014Views: 4,111    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Nature / Outdoors (23), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5) DOSE:5 hitsoralUnknown(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:150 lbLet me start by explaining that, in retrospect, I was in need of having a bad trip when this experience happened. I was only 16 years old and I had been very reckless with psychedelic drugs. I would take a couple hits of acid at school quite often and only feel the LSD equivalent of being stoned.  This is how much tolerance I guess I had built up from tripping all of the time. If I wanted to actually “fry” I would often eat more like 10 or 15 hits and although the hallucinations would be intense, I could act “normal” in front of my strict parents who always made me come home at night.  When I was in this abusive mindset I was also taking Zoloft (anti-depressant) and this may have been weakening acid and mushroom trips.  I had previously had a psychotic breakdown triggered by mushrooms but more due to anxiety, insomnia, and depression.  After being heavily medicated on Haldol and losing any sort of self esteem or confidence.  I became rather self destructive and obsessed with hallucinating.  My psychiatrist and parents were convinced that I was a person who couldn’t even smoke pot without becoming delusional and paranoid.  Needless to say they were full of shit.  This became especially apparent when I would here these lectures while tripping balls and nod my head in fake agreement.  On the other hand they had a good point.  If I cared about my self at all I would be smart enough to abstain from psychedelics at least until I was very comfortable with who I was.  In addition to the psychiatry visits, I also was getting drug tests from my parents and usually testing positive for cannabis. To try and pass these tests I would often try to stick to drugs that wouldn’t show up on drug tests like LSD and mushrooms.  It was a beautiful spring day in Northern California.  I had bought some 40 hits of white blotter acid. It was on very heavy blotter paper which leads me to believe today that it may not have been LSD as it could fit doses of less potent drugs.  As far as me knowing whether it was 25I or DOB or 3cpo or R2d2 whatever the hell... I have no idea. Anyway it was kind of cheap and I was told it was really strong which every acid dealer would tell me.  My plan was to take a few (4 or 5) to gauge the strength and then dose hard later at the show.  I don’t remember exactly how much I took and I may have touched it too much.  It went something like this...00:00  I’m at my friend K’s house with many of our friends.  Many of the people there are in my punk rock band and we don’t always get along.  I tear off a few (4 or 5) hits of the thick white blotter and chew them up. It tastes very bitter, I usually only taste paper.  +00:20 A strong speedy buzz is coming on while I’m playing the guitar on a sunny deck.  Instantly there is a pixilated spiral on the pavement and helixes rising up the redwood trees.  I note that it is kicking in rather strong and very early.  I promised K that I wouldn’t do the acid until we left his house as he was tired of me tripping and using his house as a safe house due to his much cooler parents.  Especially since he had had a bad trip long ago and quit dosing. I felt a rush of guilt as the “acid”? was beginning to manifest itself in a way it never had even on strong trips in the past.  +1:00 We leave the house to score a sack of weed.  I am still able to maintain control and act “normal”, however the high is not comfortable or all that fun at this point.  Oddly the visuals are milder than they had been when it kicked in. +1:30 We arrive back at K’s house with a sack and everyone is now aware that I am tripping as the visuals are strong and I can’t help talking about them.  They are much sharper and pixilated than previous acid trips I’d had.  LSD always had a twisty sort of oily texture to everything.  These visuals were more like what I experienced much later in life smoking DMT.  My friend K is semi-annoyed but not angry with me. Another “friend” of mine (the drummer in my band) is gleefully fucking with me. He tells me my hair is on fire and I start smelling it burning. I feel hot fire burning my scalp.  I ask everyone around if it’s really on fire.   K’s mom sees this and looks worried but just looks me in the eye and says that my hair is not on fire.   She is a very open minded woman and would probably not call my parents if it wasn’t an emergency so I wasn’t that worried but I still played it off and told her I had lit a cigarette and smelled burnt hair.  I doubt she bought it.  Things were spiraling out of control. 2:00  After people become aware and concerned that I am having a bad trip.  I retreated to K’s room and lay down.  I have tripped many times and only had semi-difficult shroom trips where I could lye in the fetal position for half an hour and then come down a bit and feel great. This was different, lying down only made everything more intense.  I saw demons angry at my carelessness and ready to punish my feeble brain.  I felt the sun piercing into my pupils and I felt long, thin needles going through my pupils and into my brain.  At this point a female friend who I did not have any sexual tension with, came in the room and hugged me telling me it was going to be OK.   This helped immensely and the embarrassment that my ego would normally suffer was non-existent. I wanted to cry but I’m really bad at doing that.  +3:00 Three of my friends and I went to a nearby park to take the possible situation away from K’s mother who has asked many times for no drug drama in her house.  I was not in terror mode as I had been before but I was pretty much peaking and totally out of my fucking mind.  I would beg for a cigarette and then light it, take a few drags and throw it away only to beg for another a minute later.  I punched one friend randomly and sent him flying into a tree.  Keep in mind I was 150 pound and couldn’t throw a punch to save my life.  I would run screaming, not out of fear but out of  simple lack of self control.  Strangers were asking if I was OK.  My friends felt they had to do something or I would most likely end up getting picked up by the police.+4:00 and on My friends have me contained in a ditch.  I’m cold and it’s getting dark.  They told me they had a friend coming to pick me up. “I’ll be damned,  I’m coming down” I thought.  Things were finally mellowing out a bit and I was going to be OK.  They told me our ride was here and I got up out of the ditch and saw my uncle standing near a phone. “&*^$^”he said, “are you OK?”  I thought I must have been wrong about coming down because my uncle was standing there and talking to me in the dark.  Then I saw my father looking worried but playing it cool.   I looked at K.  “You mother fucker” I thought.  “You narced me out and now my life is over”  The sobriety intensified as I was now in the company of my oppressive family.  I tried to play it off as though they were misinformed and I was totally sober.  I arrived at my house to see my mom crying and my aunt consoling her in the living room.  I tried to make normal conversation but couldn’t quite cut it.  I took a shower and sobered up to a normal LSD trip which I could easily handle.  At this point I knew there was no way out of being in trouble.  I was fucked and my friend set me up.  The strange part was that the after effects of whatever the fuck I was on were helping me keep from dwelling on how screwed I would be the next day.   +6:00 My Mom comes in my room and explains what happened and that I should let her know if I started to freak out again.  Yeah like I would go talk to my freaked out Mom to help myself calm down.  I was now only experiencing pleasant after effects and the not so pleasant reality of the situation.The Next Morning:  “@%^%%* get your fucking ass up here! Your Mother and I want to talk to you” My only thought was “why didn’t my friends just ditch me in the woods?”  I had a huge paper to write that Sunday and that was all I did that night other than almost knock my dad out for trying to strangle me, then get thrown out of the house in pajamas only to get picked up an hour later.  K called me and apologized.  I totally understood his choice to call my parents, although I do think that his parents being so cool and understanding helped him choose that decision.  My parents now thought he was the greatest kid when they had hated him before.  For some reason this pissed me off.   That night other parents called and accused me of distributing acid to all of my friends.  One of them H who was bi-polar had totally flipped and cut himself while so tranced he didn’t recognize his own mother.  He was put in 4 point restraint and taken to the hospital.  Police were involved but I was never officially fingered.  The truth was that I had given the rest of my stash to a girl and told her to flush it down the toilet or whatever.  She turned on like seven people,  one of them being H.  He had had previous trouble with acid and was on meds for bi-polar disorder  (very very dangerous!). I was blamed by everyone including my parents.  My other friends who took it with him never really vouched for me because they thought I was a great scapegoat and I was known to be the druggy.  One thing this experience taught me was that I was not like H.  I had psychological problems, not neurological problems.  Everyone reading this please recognize the difference.  Brain Chemical imbalances are serious and require a different attitude towards drugs, Especially psychedelics.  That is not to say that I was not incredibly stupid to  treat these powerful tools without respect.  I didn’t touch LSD for several years after that and ended up a much stronger and self respecting person. As for my parents, I feel a debt of gratitude for what they went through both before and after this experience.  To them the thought of they’re disturbed son having a bad trip on LSD was far more frightening than it was for me.  They had seen me totally delusional and catatonic before.  I did not respect them at all until after this experience.  I never ended up with any mental problems after high school, and I almost find myself strengthened by temporary mental fatigue. As for H, he still has serious problems that require a strict lifestyle of not drinking or drugging and diet exercise etc.  There is no doubt in my mind that if he never tripped he would be doing a thousand times better.  So please don’t give me that LSD can’t hurt anybody crap.  It is neutral, it can help a lot of us and destroy others.  Tripping is great, but sanity is WONDERFUL.Exp Year: 1995ExpID: 69139Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 17 Published: Sep 18, 2014Views: 5,731    LSD (2), Pharms - Sertraline (88) : Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:5 hitssublingualLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:125 lbBefore I expand on my psychedelic nightmare I wish to share some background information before my LSD experience. I have used tobacco, caffeine, alcohol, salvia, marijuana, adderall, street speed, BZP, TFMPP, LSD, MDMA, and MDEA. I am a 17 year old male weighing in 125 pounds.Prior to this LSD experience I have tripped 5 times. The highest dosage I have tripped prior to this was 3 tabs which I approximate 75-100 micrograms (completely arbitrary estimate) each. I wanted to experience an ego death trip like I read about, I scored some new tabs from a trustworthy acquaintance. The guy claimed that each hit was 210 micrograms. I was skeptical because as we all know; in the world of drugs trading, everything is claimed to be the purest, most powerful shit. This was especially unbelievable considering our contemporary time where the LSD dosages are 3 times weaker than those of the 60s. For the first in my life I saw blotter paper with hippie artwork on the back. Even though I had no other evidence of the dosage of the tabs I had a strong gut feeling these were great shit (I wish to note my intuition had never failed me when it came to drugs). Not soon after talking to him, I somehow held in my possession 10 hits of LSD, 5 for my other two friends and 5 for me.[Set and Setting]I had great anticipation for the trip. After taking a stressful 3 hour and 45 minute test that I studied intensely for I was really looking forward to a break. This and the constant academic stress that was imposed on me thanks to the rigor of my school’s academic curriculum. I had the house to myself for the entire day since my parents were going out. I prepared a playlist of diverse music, bought Geometry Wars Evolved II (an intense arcade game on the xbox 360 that I recommend any non seizure sensitive psychedelic user to experience at least once), cleaned the house, and readied some speakers. I researched and read up on high-dose LSD experiences to see what I was in for. I called two of my very close friends, C and S, to trip with me. I also intently chose them because they were two people with rather alternate personalities. S wanted to bring a friend of his, V, who wanted to try Ecstasy. Soon enough they all arrived at my house. Before I trip on any psychedelic I ‘rinse’ my emotions and psyche. I think very reflectively of all my positive and negative traits as a human being. I accept myself for everything I am. This was to prepare my mind for the journey. I dropped the 5 tabs under my tongue. Soon after S drops 3 hits, C drops 2 hits, and V drops two purple stars.It beginsT+25 - Within this short time span my environment seemed to charge with energy, inanimate objects vibrated, and my pupils dilated fully. I am the first to feel the come up. I have noticed in my experiences, the stronger the doses, the faster the come up. This was the quickest I had ever experienced a come up. The intensity only increased as time passed. There was one point where I realized just how serious the trip became and I was momentarily extremely paranoid. C and V argue about what music to play and indirectly insults each other’s taste of music. T+45- S feels the acid, C claims no effect at all, and V feels nervous. I shake off the paranoia and realize how hard I am tripping. I notice the tensions between us. C was on my left side and saw a blue aura around him. V was on my right side and he carried a red aura around him. S and I were in the center. S was directly opposite of me and as he was talking I noticed how he tried to be neutral and even had a gray aura.T+60- I am seeing waves and geometric patterns on the walls and carpets. I see sounds and intense tracers. There was a period of time where we turned off the lights and I would see glowing lights and orbs of energy pulsating to the beat of the music. It was simply fucking amazing.T+75- I am having a fucking great time. I had never felt so euphoric in my life, even more than my first time doing MDMA. It was not a body euphoria, but a completely mental euphoria. There was one point where V was feeling the peak of the ecstasy and he started pulling my hair playfully (…LOL). I actually felt his touch and it felt like I was receiving a cerebral massage.  I would closed my eyes and imagine a sky and I would see clouds as if I was directly standing on a cloud looking from the top of the world. I would lie down on the carpet and imagine beauty and I would see an island form from kaleidoscopic fragments like a puzzle rearranging itself in front of me.At this point I completely lose track of time and my memory starts to get rather foggy. I remember having some completely crazy conversations with my friends. S and I love science and we plan on studying drugs. Although the details are rather vague I remember talking about some drug interactions and even spoke of an insane theory that I wish I can bring myself to remember. I remember S and I completing each others sentences as if our brains were synced and we were reading each others minds.T+unknown- I feel good, but at the same time unaware that I do not have complete control over my body. I hallucinate myself tearing down a wall to reveal a bright grassy plain. I realize I am on my bed and I jump down. I just barely notice my friends who are all looking at me and apparently saying something to me, but I don’t pay much attention. For some reason I go to my living room and talk to ‘myself’. I realize that I tripped on LSD to destroy my ego, only to find out that my ego was already nearly gone. Something in me (which I will refer to as my subconscious) said “You deserve more than this”. After my subconscious said this, I immediately thought of S and how he always had my back in the past. My subconscious replied no. I then thought of C and how despite ignorant people always fucking with him because of his homosexuality, he remained the most positive, happy person I know. My subconscious replied “No, you, Tawsif, you deserve way more”. After this I apparently remember going outside hallucinating insane visions, but at the same time not realizing I was in reality. I remember trying to go through a wall and failing and my subconscious kept telling me, “You’re doing it wrong”. At one point I remember lying on my back, unable to move for some reason and thinking of my ex-girlfriend who is still the love of my life. I started to hallucinate her from head to toe, but right before she was fully formed, my subconscious said “You deserve more than that” and she slowly disappeared. Not soon after I saw a bunch of cops and FBI carrying a stretcher and walking toward me. I thought my neighbor probably had an accident again. The next thing I remembered was being inside an ambulance with bright lights all over me and feeling incredibly nervous. I’m not sure if I was screaming, but I was tied down and someone was cutting down my shirt and my pants. T+36 hours- I wake up to find myself in a hospital bed. I am tied down, there are tubes going through my arms, and I feel something weird near my groin area. I look down the blankets to see a urinary catheter. My head hurts, my elbows and knees hurt, and I feel like there are cuts on my back. I feel like I am in a dream because I cannot remember anything at all or how I got here.[Retrospection]- After speaking with my family members, friends, neighbors, and dropping LSD the week after, this is what I happened. After awhile my friends reported that I was not responding normally to any of them. I jumped on my bed and tore down my curtains (hence when I thought I was tearing down a wall). My friends were desperately trying to talk me into chilling out, but I apparently tried to kill S (note I am a pacifist). S and I had wrestled and sparred in many occasions, but he said I had so much energy that he and the other guys couldn’t hold me down for more than a minute.  After I had left the house, they left as well out of panic and claimed they were scared out of their minds. My neighbor saw me running around on the road, stopping in front of a car, and then dancing on top of it (I do not recall this at all). She then tried to talk to me, but I ran away from block to block as she and her other family members tried to catch me. She said I then went back to my house, ran upstairs and jumped from the balcony which is a good 15 ft. from the ground. I fell on my back somehow and hit my head on the concrete. I remember this part as I remember feeling something sharp in my head that was probably pain, but didn’t feel like pain at all. After I fell, her nephew, grandma, uncle and dad were sitting on me and holding me down because I was trying to resist again. They called 911 and the police and FBI came. They injected me with tranquilizers or some sort of drug to try to calm me down or put me to sleep. Throughout the whole ride to the hospital I was said to be kicking and screaming. During my stay in the hospital, the nurses tried to take my blood and inject me with other things. My parents said that I kept fighting and ripped the tubes off my arms a few times, spurting blood all over the place. Finally they dosed me with a strong enough sedative to put me to sleep for a good amount of time.I have always hated to have a bad trip, but this was beyond bad. This is the worst trip I could imagine myself to ever have. I am lucky to be alive because I really should be dead. Running into cars and falling on my head should have at least had me crippled, but I remain strong both physically and mentally. I had open sores on my head and my back, bruises on my knees and elbows, and big blue bruises on my arms where I ripped the tubes off.  I highly respect drugs and I believe myself to be responsible doing this in a closed environment with friends. However, I do not regret my experience at all. Although being a train wreck experience, I have learned much about myself and the unpredictability of psychedelics. I do not understand why I had such a psychotic reaction from LSD as I do not think I have any underlying mental disorders.

This summer holidays he came over to Brazil (where I'm originally from) to take a one month trip through the coast. We went to Salvador in Bahia, and from there we caught a catamaran to this island called Boipeba. It's a beautiful place, paradisiac beaches, hot chicks and all of that. I was not really sure about taking psychedelic drugs, as I usually bad trip on losing control over things, but since I had tried mescaline on new years with no adverse effects, I thought 'yeah, what the fuck, everyone has to try acid at least once in his life'. As I said the setting was perfect for it, and he was an experienced user, I went for it.This is a funny part of the story: we had found a huge rock of hash at the hostel we were staying at, so we traded it for a hit of acid with this daft hippy dude. In fact we were trying to buy some coke (after all, he had came to South America), but he only had tabs, so we traded for it.It was about 1 in the morning, I took half and so he did. When it hit, I felt my fingers tingly, my body was feeling a bit weird, and I was really agitated. Then we sat on the city centre square (it's a 5000 inhabitants place) and started smoking durrys with our feet, laughing in a real light way. In about 30 minutes we both lay back introspective, and that's when I first noticed that the colours were brighter, but since I was expecting an exciting trip (as the mescaline was, and as coke is) all I did was to get daft and do stupid things such as drunken behaviour.We headed back to the hostel for a while (mind you I wasn't hallucinating at all), and lay down to sleep. We turned off the lights and we both turned on our IPods (that's when I realised I was hallucinating), and started swinging them around to see that it created a huge trail of light, like a series of blue screens at the same time floating in the air. We got a bit agitated from that, and started making jokes, talking about the trip. He saw the wooden walls melting, and everything breathing. He told me his dad had taken it back in the day, and we started laughing about thinking of Greg on tabs, as he is a real serious person. This lead us to an obnoxious state, because we both felt like hanging out and enjoying the trip. So we went to the beach to see the sunrise.We go to the beach at about 4 in the morning, and it was still dark. So we went to the other end of the beach. When walking, I saw the lines the waves marked on the sand  deconstructing and reconstructing, and generally everything was brighter, blurred. When we got to the other end of the beach, we sat by a resort recreational area that was deserted by that time and started imagining that Fraulein Zeiss the generic gringo mother of three with her kids would come down and meet up two acid rots on the beach, saying 'mein Gott!'. Thats when the acid started making my thoughts become an incontestable truth to me, and I 'realised' he was the average bloke, the fair dinkum. He had never struck me as an aussie, but from that moment on, while I was tripping, he was one. We headed back, and all the lines were deconstructing and reconstructing, such as the horizon, the shore line and the wave marks on sand. We laughed all the way back. Mid way I started hallucinating badly, even though I could only realise that after it was over. I looked at him, and his face was morphing into something scary, he looked like Paddy McGuinness, his eyes and hair became really dark, his receding hairline, cheek bones and ears all came apart from each other, making his face ugly. I had a feeling that time was revolving, as I looked at him and it seemed like a deja vu every time. I had a feeling that time was revolving, as I looked at him and it seemed like a deja vu every time. We got to this spot where I lay on the sand, and he went in the shallow waters and sat there. I looked up at the sky, and it was beautiful, vanilla coloured clouds at 6 in the morning. I felt whole, joyful, and this vanilla sky thing stuck in my head in the acid sort of fixed idea. I thought to myself 'man I really should take tabs with my ex girlfriend'. That's when I was struck by an eternal moment, and got scared shitless.In one moment I realised that I was far out, that I could never get out of that spot in the sand, and that there was so much I wanted to do with my life that I couldn't get stuck on that trip. I called him up and said 'bro we gotta go, I'm really scared of being here'. We went back to the hostel, and on the way back I had my final great moments of trippy happiness. I was struck by another eternal moment in the woods, but this time it seemed like the environment was more familiar, and this time I just said 'wooow this shit's powerful!'. We got back to the hostel and went into town to buy eats, and in all of the course I was scared that I wasn't in the consensual reality, and that I could get myself in shit for it. My rear vision was bent and my time perception was completely messed up. We bought some miserable cheap cocoa puffs that didn't sit well at all in my stomach.Headed back to the hostel, and when we got there I vomited all I had eaten. I sat and listened to Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin and it made sense to me! We started drawing, and I made a lisergic masterpiece in which reads 'VANILLA amore te amo', in reference to the vanilla sky strain on thought. I wrote some mind-numbing senseless texts talking about how I was far out and wanted to go back. An excerpt: 'I am a maroon of reality'. That's when things got bad, I got frightened by the idea that I'd be left alone and that no matter how much I tried I'd never function normally like I did prior to acid. My mate comforted me, saying that he had seen that many times before in first experiences. Every time I looked at something I realised I was still hallucinating badly (eg. He was uglier then on the beach, the sky was green, there were patches of either purple or green everywhere, and when I shut my eyes I saw tridimensional visuals). Instead of relaxing and enjoying the shut eyes visuals, which were by all means absolutely fantastic, I couldn't get my mind off the fact that I might not ever come back to the consensual reality. I had just broken up a relationship and she made me really miserable, because she meant a lot to me, so I started talking about her to him, and I started crying like a baby over her. I asked him to get my wallet she had given to me, held it as if it was her. From that moment on, there's nothing much worth mentioning as it was pretty much the same thing. Even my memory has selected the parts previous to this, as I can't really remember much of my bad trip. All I can remember is that it was overwhelming, powerful, miserable. I stated that it had been the worst hours of my life, and I can't remember many worse hours then these.I don't really know which level of psychedelic experience I reached, as there are elements of both 2d and 3d stage.I shut my eyes and talked to him about the visuals for quite a while, before I got totally exhausted and decided to go to bed. When I woke up I was frightened that I'd not fully left the trip, and started searching my senses for everything that could be hallucinations. I only relaxed when I read online about the post traumatic stress disorder, and that the effects of the drug itself had vanished long before. I could finally relax that I had come again to Konsensual Reality Inc.Exp Year: 2007ExpID: 69875Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 17, 2016Views: 9,434    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), First Times (2), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:2 hits LSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:160 lbThis report is for people with Christian backgrounds and beliefs in Christ who are considering taking LSD. Be warned. I learned some interesting things about the nature of 'hell.'I began experimenting with LSD extensively last summer. I was taking it 2 times a week in small dosages and having the time of my life. Everything from working to social interaction to alone time was a game and extremely interesting. I had many insights into possible realities and insights into who I was and nothing was too shocking. This was the honeymoon phase. Fast-forward a year later. After probably 30 trips I finally had a scary experience. Psychologically scary. Reality shattering.The setting was my bachelor pad house. My house was weird...christmas lights strung up everywhere as our ceiling lighting, stadium couches, and roommates NOT usually home. We also had a cat (more on this creature later). A good friend J was over who had only taken acid only once before. J is a friend who I got to know well based on the amazingly open, honest communication we could share since the time we met 2 years ago randomly through a mutual friend. Our goal was to go on a mutual trip of deep conversation about the nature of reality and ourselves, as well as our relationship.We dropped in the evening, about 6 p.m. I have gotten to a point where I can almost immediately feel the effects of a tab of LSD. Very very subtle. It might be placebo. Anyway we launched into conversation about life immediately, sitting at the dinner table with some fruit juice and a couple beers. After about 2 hours of random conversation with nothing too amazing, we got onto the subjects of God, religion, love.I soon realized that me and J were at psychological opposite ends of the universe when it comes to the nature of God, good, and evil. This is when the trip started getting scary. I remember arguing for along time, probably 2+ hours about each of our stances on the nature of God, but making no progress towards an understanding or acceptance of each other's views. This is about the time I entered into a very real, and very scary (I am shivering thinking about it now, almost 6 months later) thought loop. A thought loop is a circular reasoning loop that you cannot easily escape, and has been described by others on LSD. For the rest of the trip (6 hours) until I fell asleep with fear and exhaustion, I would go into my room for a time to escape the painful conversation and then return to the living room to try to remedy our impasse of mutual insight. On each return, I would have EXTREME deja vu to the point of questioning wether or not I could escape my altered state, ever. And mind you I was lucid. No crazy visuals or trouble speaking or seeing. This was all in my head. No crazy visuals or trouble speaking or seeing. This was all in my head. My room became hell, the place where I was isolated from God, truth and this girl in the living room. She became my salvation. The only way to get out of my self-induced hell was to convince her that I was actually experiencing Hell as described in the Bible, which I could not do. She simply didn't buy it. She remained steadfast in her agnosticism. I also somehow believed she was a figment of my imagination, no longer real but created by me to test myself and my ability to find truth. I felt that if I fell asleep, she would no longer exist the next day, and would haunt my memory forever. The cat mentioned earlier was the cause of extreme mental stress. The cat became a symbol of disorder and confusion, as well as randomness and evil. It simply would not do anything predictable, and seemed to taunt me and hide and show itself at the most inopportune moments.I decided at some point to take a walk around the neighborhood, but it provided no relief. I felt I was walking away from myself and my salvation.I fell asleep probably at 4 a.m. After a very traumatic thought loop rollercoaster. The next day I was shaken, nervous, and very scared that I had gone too far into myself. I went home and told my mother about my trip, she didn't know I had ever tried drugs before. It was a hard conversation but we got through it. Me and J have never been the same since. We remain pleasant, but our friendship was rocked that night in ways I can't easily describe.Since then I have been on a journey of truth seeking and not much has come of it. I believe acid has the power to open your mind so much that the potential realities that it reveals become confusing and ultimately harmful to an individual. Ignorance is bliss as they say. I am instantly reminded of the story of Adam and Eve. The apple of the knowledge of good and evil was plucked at the beginning of time, and we are still plucking it today, for better or worse.Exp Year: 2008ExpID: 74344Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Aug 26, 2016Views: 2,190    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:500 ug LSDBODY WEIGHT:59 kgI want to try and give here a phenomenological description of a chemical self-induced psychosis (bad trip), which I experienced about 15 years ago, most likely in 1995. The peak of that experience was the temporary complete eradication of my consciousness and personality in an extreme state of pure anxiety. Following that description, I try and describe the process, that 'rebooted' my personality, and interpret the underlying psychological processes.My personal background and trauma connected to the event is, that my parents divorced when I was 7 years, experienced a mild sexual abuse from13 to 15 years of age, as I also started drinking and smoking around 13 years. Hash and more 'hard drugs' beginning with the age of 16. By the age of 20 I was an 'acid head', enjoying much time on LSD and psylos (hallucinogenic mushrooms). The experience is located in a house, that had been a squat for over 10 years, but now the occupants were moving out and the owner regained control of his property. The atmosphere was depressed and the future uncertain. I was on my way to this house from our home in the village (Funny Farm), and administered to myself orally the strongest dose of lysergic acid dietylamid (LSD) I ever took, about 500 micrograms. In the evening, only two of my friends stayed with me in the living room of that house, all others were in the city, partying. I held a big cup of tea in my hands, and felt the chemical starting to exercise its effects. For a moment I had the impression that the cup in my hands was my brain, which I drank from. Then this comfortable warmth spread through my body, a feeling of  'coming home', which signalised the start of the trip. The feeling, that my brain opened up to all knowledge and all wisdom was freely accessible and became a part of myself, and I a part of it.  At one point the walls, floor and ceiling began to merge into each other, the world began to flow like a river. I experienced myself as part of everything and completely integrated in the 'Big Picture', an atom in an ectoplasmic sea, an illuminated being of eternal dimensions. These optical and emotional hallucinations, as well as the 'grand thoughts' have been a general part of my LSD experiences and the reason why I took it. But then something exceptional happened: The trip hit hard. So hard, that I completely forgot that I was under strong chemical influence. This was usually a safeguard, to remember, while tripping, that it's all part of the trip. Now this was gone. This was usually a safeguard, to remember, while tripping, that it's all part of the trip. Now this was gone. A few weeks before, I read George Orwell's novel '1984', which plays out a terrible vision of the future, with a complete monitored and surveilled world with a secret 'thought-police' and constant war as a means to control society and production. The anti-hero in Orwell's novel was captured by the thought-police and tortured in the Ministry of Love, in room 101. In this room the prisoners are faced with their inner worst fear. The walls around me acted like bubbles that are about to burst. I found myself in a reality, I could not comprehend. I stood before one of my friends and begged him, 'Help me, please, please help me!' None of them knew that I had taken LSD. Neither did I. Now the anxiety centers in my brain really warmed up, and naked, total fear spread to each cell in my body. I realised, that my two friends were actually members of the infamous thought-police. I knew they came to expose me and torture me in room 101. In panic I stormed out of the living room into the kitchen and took hold of the bread knife. I wanted to defend myself by all means possible. I waited in the kitchen. Nobody came. If they would have come and forced me out, I would have killed them. Then I reasoned with myself and thought, that this was not the solution. They were the almighty thought-police, and already in my head. So maybe I was the problem. And that could be solved by a strike to the heart with the bread knife. But something inside me knew, that this also was not a solution. So I dropped the knife and went back into the living room. Now I was in room 101. I did not know my greatest fear, but there it was. It filled me out, each part of my body and every angle of my thoughts. No escape. There is no God. The walls were thin as paper, and they were about to tear. And behind the walls was evil. Not a relative evil, but the ultimate, all consuming, destroying, powerful evil. And I lost all hope. On LSD time is perceived very different from the regular, common perception. Sometimes time is not perceived at all. Only eternity. Here and now, nothing else. To my great despair, this was the state I found myself in. A prisoner of the ultimate evil, without hope, without time. Nothing human to be found. My friends were sleeping, and I, or the last rudiments of 'I', were dissolving in eternal horror and hopelessness, all strength drizzled out of my body. And at last there was nothing more. REGENERATION AND THE LOGIC-MACHINE Of course, I cannot describe the 'state of nothingness'. Let the philosophers discuss it. Consciousness is registering a cramp, there is transparent liquid vomit on the floor.Consciousness registers 'I' am vomit.Consciousness registers wooden floor under the vomit.Consciousness registers 'I' am wooden floor and have always been wooden floor.These are the first conscious moments after my personality had been dissolved by anxiety. I am laying on one of the sofas in the living room, opposite on the other sofa my friend sleeps. I am registering the whole room, not really sure of what I am and how I fit into this scenario. Slowly my body feeling returns to me. I conclude, that I am not the wooden floor, since 'I' and the wooden floor have very distinct and different proportions. There is a division, a separation between 'I' and the rest of the room. This division came to my awareness by the increasing feeling of my physical form. Very shortly, when my consciousness registered the sofa after the wooden floor, I thought to be a sofa. But this happened almost simultaneously with recognizing myself lying on that sofa, so I had to smile at the thought of 'being a sofa'.Now I saw my friend sleeping on the other sofa, and went softly to him, kneeling at the sofa. I compared myself to him, and came to the liberating conclusion 'I am a man'. This whole process of regeneration did not take more than a few seconds. That which started the process, I call 'logic machine' and explain it further in my following interpretation of this phenomena.PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF THE LSD-PSYCHOSISThe whole experience from the beginning of fear to nothingness had a duration of about 3 hours, as we later recapitulated. I now start the interpretation with the last paragraph, 'Regeneration and the Logic-Machine'. In the first parts of seconds of the conscious awakening, there is no form or division. All that registers is one. This I interpret as a revival of the symbiotic state, where the child does not make a distinction between itself and the mother, as described in Mahler's Object Relations Theory (Objektrelationsteori).The description here goes only as far as to the point of separation, where I draw a line between 'I' and 'you' (my friend on the other sofa).I thought a lot about, how I came from 'nothingness' to 'I' through the consciousness. 'I am the wooden floor' is an extreme strange state of being, like a small flash of consciousness, that has no critical sense, but accepts all. I believe that the Logic-Machine is part of the origin of my personality, that dates back into my earliest childhood. It registers the surroundings and put them into relation to self. Because I had a healthy and safe childhood up to the first seven years, this part of my personality had not been violated. This fundamental structure made it possible for me to heal the condition the bad trip had caused me. That is, why this condition also not was a real psychosis, but only like a psychosis. The worst thinkable fear, expressed in the experience with one sentence: 'There is no God' (read: there is no goodness, mercy or love). Psychologically seen, the situation was a reproduction of the divorce. The underlying fear is the fear of separation, which is the base fear of my existence. That fear was made very real in the divorce of my parents and the intimacy of my childhood had a sudden end. Through the deep impact of LSD, I was able to dive into these areas of my subconsciousness, and was confronted with the inner terms and trauma that resulted from that time. All relations were hurt or disappeared, when I lost faith in others during the divorce. The separation was reality, with all the ugly consequences, to my subjective experience and perception. For most of my adult life, I believed the divorce happened when I was 10 years old. Later on, through talks with my Grandmother, I learned that I was 7. That meant, I suppressed the first three years after the divorce from my consciousness. The 'ultimate evil', that destroyed me, is a projection of my own Lifeworld (oplevelses verden), which I split in order to bear with the emotional trauma (Liv Strand). The experience of this evil is a direct result of my fear of separation, not accepting the terms of the divorce, because of the heavy emotional crisis. When I am in the kitchen during the bad trip, I contemplate suicide. Something inside of me rejects this as a doable solution. When I was in my early teens, I learned the technique of auto suggestion, reading about it and also having my mother explain it to me. I used this for myself, because I had the impression, that life would be extremely difficult to deal with. I adopted subconsciously the attitude, that 'I would never commit suicide, no matter how bad things turned out. No matter how bad things go, it will be good again'. This became a deep conviction for me. And I believe it was the reason why I survived the situation in the kitchen. The hallucinations and grand thoughts had their origin in the impact of the lysergic acid on the brain and are a natural effect of the acid consumption. Those were not part of my personality, but a desirable and coveted result of LSD intake. That is why this experience was not a real psychopathological psychosis, but merely a pseudo psychosis. I felt inspired by Timothy Leary in these days, who was an American psychiatrist who believed LSD could be used to understand man's mind.Jan :)written in Hamar, Norway, 2008.Translated into English and edited in Haugesund, Norway, 2015Exp Year: 1995ExpID: 108950Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 22 Published: Oct 1, 2016Views: 8,837    LSD (2) : Alone (16), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:2 hits NBOMe Series(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:127 lbI went to a day rave event with my boyfriend and he had planned to sell LSD. The usual guy he got it from was in jail so he decided to get it from another trusted source. This source turned out to be not so trustworthy...Prior to taking 2 tabs of what I thought was LSD, my boy and I had been fighting and my ex was the one who drove me to this event. It was bad vibes all around though there were lots of friends around so I figured I would be fine. My boyfriend and I are experienced trippers, we will usually take 5-10 tabs each. I feel the tension is important to mention because it will help understand why I later had a bad trip. I am also severely asthmatic and have to take Q-var and Combivent at least twice a day plus my rescue inhaler which is Ventolin.As soon as the purple pyramid gel tabs touched my tongue I knew something was wrong. As soon as the purple pyramid gel tabs touched my tongue I knew something was wrong. There was a VERY distinct sour taste. I shrugged it off and waited it out. The high was not like LSD, I felt overwhelmed and paranoid. The park we were at was very sketch, there were tweakers and crackheads and wingnuts of all sorts harassing us, getting in trouble with the cops, and hanging out inside a massive portable toilet. They were literally just chilling in the filth. I couldn’t stomach going in there so I went into the bathrooms of what I believe was a city hall, not sure. It was some sort of public building. I stumbled into the handicapped stall and was very much dissociated, saw a chick in there amongst piles of toilet paper with a comforter over her and a needle sticking out of her arm. I did my business and looked in the mirror for a bit but I don’t remember much.Throughout this trip I felt very dissociated and uncomfortable, I also felt very sad and scared. I blacked out for large sections of time and don’t remember much until my boyfriend had to leave. The tone of voice he used threw me into a downward spiral of despair. I thought he had died. Our friend who was driving me home kept saying I would see him soon when I asked if he was dead which was probably not the best thing to say because after that I hallucinated that she was driving really recklessly and crashing into things. All around us things were collapsing, I felt like I was decomposing and insects were eating me, I thought I was alone in the car sitting in the passenger seat. I hallucinated a time lapse in which my friend who was driving, my boyfriend and I were all fried out wingnuts who wandered the desolate freeways late at night abusing each other and looking for meth or crack. It was like the ghost of Christmas future came and gave me some sort of harsh reality check. The car stopped and everything around us was darkening and collapsing like I had reached the end of a video game and I was the protagonist. I had failed. Game over.I kept screaming wordlessly in agony because it felt like I was being ripped through dimensions. It was like everything I had worked for was taken from me. I thought he was dead. Besides that fact, I had totally left my body several times and hallucinated this supreme divine being that changed faces and voices and personalities. They were all human and combined into one celestial form that was my soul mate. I thought that the friend who was driving me was the same entity as my boyfriend and another friend we were with earlier at the day rave. The decomposition hallucination kept happening as I felt my life was over.On top of that I had to piss really badly and I was miraculously holding it in for like an hour or two. I don’t remember much. I became too rowdy for my friend to handle and she called an ambulance. All throughout my freakout I kept asking where my boyfriend was, they called him and let him talk to me I think? I kept hearing his voice in the background saying reassuring things until the doctor came. I was having an asthma attack I was having an asthma attack because of the drug, it was creating too much mucus in my lungs. I kept saying “I don’t wanna die” over and over. As I was injected with various fluids to calm me down I kept telling the paramedics and cops that I loved them because I thought they were this one supreme being. I thought that all the people I had interacted with from the beginning of time were just one person that I was meant to be with like a soul mate and that I had wasted all my chances through reincarnation to get things right. Now that my boyfriend was gone I had no more chances. The staff kept reassuring me that he was alive but I couldn’t trust any of them. Oh and another thing that really fucked with me, one of the security guards from a hospital I frequented on account of suicide attempts was transferred to this hospital I was at and I had no clue what dimension I was in or where I was. Makes sense now of course, the cities were neighboring.The doctor made me listen to Pink Floyd and gave me some Alex Grey artwork to look at while I calmed down.

There were several instances in which people and objects disappeared from my sight and it was just like I was in a room alone. The doctor left me uneasy and I was fully convinced I had been taken to a dimension where I would never be released from the hospital, where all my friends and people I knew never existed, all the things I had done were all a dream I had woken up from and my new reality was this horrifyingly bland empty world of nothingness. The doctor said three angels were there to rescue me. It was my two most responsible friends and my boyfriend. The relief I felt was immeasurable. They took me home and I went to sleep after staring at my mostly naked body, watching the scars shift underneath my flesh. I woke up the next morning and went back to work.Exp Year: 2016ExpID: 108714Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: 19 Published: Oct 22, 2016Views: 5,556    LSD (2), NBOMe Series (539) : Bad Trips (6), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), What Was in That? (26), Rave / Dance Event (18) DOSE:1 hit LSD(blotter / tab)   smokedCannabis BODY WEIGHT:140 lbI had taken LSD 9 times before this trip. My highest dose had been 345ug. I had a 130ug tab and 2 grams of weed. I decided to trip at night with a couple of friends. I was the only one tripping out of me and 2 friends.We were all sitting around a fire in my backyard waiting for my parents to go to sleep. One of my friends had to leave by 12 and he hasn't seen someone trip before so he talked me into taking it while my parents were up an just hope they went to sleep before it kicked in.It was about an hour after taking it that my dad came down to sit by the fire for a few minutes before going to bed. As soon as my dad came out I had started to feel it kicking in. My dad went to bed and me and my friends lit up a blunt. After the blunt I still wasn't feeling like I was tripping that hard so me and my friends went to Walmart. As soon as we got into Walmart it started getting much more intense. I noticed patterns on the tiles and I started getting a kaleidoscopic vision. My friends could tell I was starting to trip hard so we got out of Walmart fast. We got to my house and one friend left and the other one decided to spend the night to make sure I was okay.We got back inside and turned on the tv. My friend started to get tired and kept dozing off. So far I had not gotten any bad vibes or anything, I was just content with the patterns and breathing walls. My friend was telling me stories of when he did a 4 tab trip and how he had a horrible time. About 2 hours into the trip I started noticing that the tv was pausing and sneaking in words from what sounded like a different language. I looked at my friend and his eyes looked almost like a cats and they had sort of a reddish glow to them. He would scare me by jumping up and making faces at me. I would yell at him and tell him to stop but he wouldn't say a word to me. It continued to happen for hours. 4 hours in I was convinced I was having a bad trip 4 hours in I was convinced I was having a bad trip. I couldn't look at anything without it turning into something scary and demonic. At around 5am, about 6 hours into the trip I had been talking to myself for about an hour.  I was telling myself it would be okay and trying to give myself reassurance. I decided to wake my friend up. He woke up and took a drink of his Gatorade and for some reason I thought he was in danger. I slapped the Gatorade out of his hand and he punched me in the stomach. This didn't help my trip at all. At this point it made me 100% certain that my friend was trying to harm me in some way.6am and 7 hours into tripping I was under my covers trembling with fear of what was going on outside my blanket. I never ended up coming out from under my blanket. I stayed in hiding until I fell asleep a few hours later. I did not learn the most interesting part of this trip until the next day. My friend who had stayed the night asked how my trip was when he fell asleep and I had told him all about it. He told me he fell asleep early in the night and never woke up. I had imagined everything he did, from him scaring me to him punching me, it was all just imagined by me. I had never had a trip like this, where I had imagined a whole conversation with someone and everything that I thought had happened was a lie. My next trip will be my biggest dose yet. I will be taking 5 tabs, each one 130ug. I have mixed emotions on this trip after having such an intense experience on just one of these tabs, excited, nervous, and anxious. I am on a mission to take 10 tabs by the time I am 18 which is in 8 months. I have always felt like there is so much more to LSD then I have experienced which is why I want to take such a high dose.

My father passed away unexpectedly and I suffered from horrible typhoid and malaria thereafter. I recovered but not completely, it's like my immune system was stuck in attack mode even after I recovered. What followed was endless doctor visits and tests which were always normal. So western medicine did what it does.  Told me it was depression/CFS. There was a component of that but I knew there was more to it. Its like my cells had run out of something very critical. I was a profuse sweater and now I couldn’t sweat even in high heat. I took antidepressants. 12 of them... none worked. Then naturopathy, Then vitamins. They helped a bit. But by 2014 I had knocked on almost every door and knew it was time for somewhat drastic. In all this time I was researching on pubmed and theorized that a shock to the nervous system was what was needed. Plus I had read that LSD helped people recover from depression too. So I thought it to be a good chemical target. I obtained some 400 mcg tabs. And being a cautious person that I was decided to try only 50 mcg. It was evening. First effects were a feeling of individual cells in my body waking up. Now those who haven’t suffered from CFS [Chronic Fatigue Syndrome] probably can’t relate to this but it was as clear as daylight for me. No visuals or hallucinations… but just clarity.  However in a short amount of time my cells ran out of whatever they were lacking and all I could feel was a metabolic accelerator being pressed by the LSD while I had no gas in the system. My heart rate started to go up and then I first felt guilt. Intense awful guilt. Then came the fear, then the panic attack. I have has panic attacks before but this fear was something else. It was raw fear. Then came the ambulance and then there was ER. After a whole night on ativan and under observation, I was released in morning. CFS still intact and a bit worse which got to baseline in the next few days by some methylfolate and b12 and vit D. My set and setting was understandably not ideal. But it wasn’t awful either. I can classify this as a typical bad trip. But beneath the surface. I can say for sure that it definitely doesn’t play with the underlying mechanism for CFS in a positive way. Even if my emotions were positive, my nervous system would not have been able to produce the necessary juice to let LSD do what I needed to do. And hence the problem.It's not going to fix it.Exp Year: 2014ExpID: 109612Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 31 Published: Dec 10, 2016Views: 2,170    LSD (2) : Depression (15), Therapeutic Intent or Outcome (49), Bad Trips (6), Unknown Context (20) DOSE:  repeatedsmokedCannabis  1.5 hitssublingualLSD(blotter / tab) 0.5 tabletsoralMDMA    repeatedsmokedCannabis Before I get started with this trip-report, let me provide you with some information about my drug intake prior to this experience.I'd smoked weed countless times before this trip, and had taken MDMA more times than I could count, too. I'd tripped on acid 3 times in total, though the third time I got shitty tabs so I don't really like to count that as a real trip. I'd taken n-bombe once. The day of the trip began, and I hadn't slept a wink the night before. So the entire day I was very tired and groggy, with only marijuana to assist me in staying awake and alert. Me and a friend, we'll call him B, went and picked up three tabs between us as we were on our way to a house party with a number of our other friends. We arrived at the house a little early as we knew the person who was hosting the party and she allowed us to sit in her living area and watch TV while we waited for people to arrive. With people due to begin arriving in the next 45 minutes, we decided it'd be a good idea to stick our tabs under our tongue. As people began to arrive, I could feel myself coming up a little, I felt a little strange, but I couldn't put my finger on why. 10 minutes passed, and I decided to get up and head into the kitchen as a few people had just arrived and I wanted to go and say hi. I walked into the kitchen, and as I did so it felt like the door frame twisted to one side and I'd just stepped into another world - that's the moment I knew the acid was beginning to hit me. 'Woah! What the fuck' I exclaimed in a playful manner, explaining to the sober people in the room what'd just happened. They all found it hilarious, and I went back into the living area with a grin on my face. This is where things began to get crazy.I've came to the conclusion that in the past, I'd only taken crappy tabs, and the tabs I got that night were the first decent tabs of acid I'd taken. I'd obviously felt the effects of acid with the other tabs I've taken, the confusion, visuals, etc, etc. but never as intensely as I did this night. The first thing I noticed that began to trigger my bad trip was that I was unable to properly watch the television, in the past, I'd be able to get a general idea of what was going on, and I'd somewhat understand the premise of the show I was watching. This time however, because I saw an actor from 'Friends' the TV show, I was continuously thinking we were watching Friends, even though we weren't. The few people left in the living area had to keep explaining to me that we weren't watching friends, they found it funny that I continued to forget everything that was happening on the TV, and that I couldn't even keep ahold of what we were watching. I laughed along with them, but in the back of my mind I began to think 'This has never happened to me before on acid, is this acid? Have I been given something else?' the main reason for me beginning to think this was probably due to the fact I'd never bought off this dealer before, I didn't even know her, it was B's dealer - not mine.The next thing that happened that I'd never experienced before was people's faces beginning to become distorted and stretch. Everyone I looked at had HUGE eyes, and I mean HUGE. It was like their eye began somewhere around the middle of their forehead and ended at their cheekbone. This again, trigged the doubts that what I'd taken was actually acid.  All that was racing through my mind was these stories about people dying from 'acid clones', people having seizures, all that shit. My friend began to speak to me from across the room, I couldn't even work out what he was saying, I was just focusing on how flushed everyone's face looked, and how his eyebrow was slowly creeping down his face and twisting around his mouth as he spoke. I didn't want to tell anyone how I was feeling because I'd been bigging up acid for the past 4 months, constantly raving about how amazing it is and how I can't wait to get more. I just sat in the armchair and tried to ride it out.I then received news that two of my friends were on the way, H and C. They'd both never seen me on acid, and I wasn't sure how to handle being on a bad trip around them. They were both very bubbly and excitable people, especially when they were together, and out of literally everyone at that party, I was the closest with them both, so there was no escaping conversation, and I was dreading their loud personalities while I was feeling like this. there was no escaping conversation, and I was dreading their loud personalities while I was feeling like this. B was tripping alongside me, but he wasn't saying much, he never really speaks, and he definitely wouldn't tell someone if he was feeling bad, too. We kind of sat next to each other on the couch in the living area tripping utter balls, with 1,000 bad thoughts racing through both of our minds. I didn't know it yet, but B was having a bad trip, too. It was B's first time trying acid, having only tried n-bombe in the past, and it was my responsibility to look out for him in case this happened, I'd never foreseen that I'd have a bad trip too. As I sat beside him, I simply turned to him and said 'This is strong as fuck acid, I've never had anything like this in my life.' I didn't want to trip him out, so I said acid, but I used the word loosely. He just turned to me and laughed a little bit and said 'Yes.' - I could tell he was feeling the extremely intense effects of the acid just from his quiet response. I didn't know if it was just the acid, but he didn't look himself. I tried to disregard this, as all it was doing was adding to my paranoia, so I simply began to look around the room. This didn't help. I looked at the floor, and saw that it looked as if I was at the bottom of a hill, the floor, and the furniture on the floor (The TV stand, the armchair, etc) all looked like they were on a slant. It was like the floor was tilted upwards ever so slightly, and the room also had this new 'aura' about it, it's hard to explain. I decided to turn my focus to the TV, as the tilting was again something I haven't experienced before on acid so it began to trip me out even more, almost everything I looked at seemed to contribute to what was about to become the worst trip of my life. For a few hours, the acid got progressively stronger, and stronger. At this point, I was unable to even comprehend what was happening on the TV show I was watching, I was utterly and totally confused. Suddenly, the TV screen appeared to 'pop out' from the actual TV set itself, it was as if the screen was hovering just in front of the TV set. Something then came on the TV with a fairground ride or something, I don't know, I can't really remember. But either way, it began flashing an array of different colours, and amazingly, whatever colour was displayed on the TV was mirrored across the entire room, the TV flashed orange, the entire room was orange for a split second, it turned green, so did the room. At the time, I didn't find this enjoyable at all, and knowing that my two friends, H and C were on the way, I decided to head upstairs.I stumbled through the narrow corridor after making my way upstairs and looked for an empty room. I peeped my head around a corner and found an empty room with a double bed. I slowly entered the room and perched myself on the end of the bed, one thing I noticed is that the bedside table that should have been to the left of me beside my knee was now somehow completely stretched out and covered the entire left field of my vision. It was like everything I wasn't focused on was stretched towards the centre of my vision, and I hated it. It wasn't long before someone noticed I was missing, and the people who happened to find me were H and C. For some reason, I thought they were going to purposely make my trip worse if I told them about it, so I kept silent and nodded along while they spoke to me. They both came and joined me in the room I was in and began to have their own little conversation about random shit, they knew I was on acid and just presumed I was zoning out happily in my own world, so they left me to it for a while. I was then pulled into the conversation when I heard them mention pills, C said something along the lines of 'I can't wait for D to get back with these pills though, then I'll be buzzing like you J (me) haha!' I then stared at him blankly, to which he said 'Are you enjoying it, bro?' I paused for a few moments, and decided I had to tell SOMEONE, heck, my girlfriend was at that party somewhere and I had been avoiding her, I didn't even want to tell her. C is someone who knew his shit about drugs, in-fact, he's the one that introduced me to the stronger drugs, other than weed. So I worked up the courage to say 'No.' I told him and H that I thought I was having a bad trip, and luckily their moods changed in an instant. They both suddenly went into serious mode, which panicked me even more, because in my confused state of mind I was still convincing myself I was on something other than acid and was going to die. This is moment where I remember thinking 'I'm going to die.' I honestly thought I was either going to end up dead, or I was stuck this way for the rest of my life. H grabbed me a glass of water and they both began to comfort me as I slowly sipped the water, this made me feel a little better, but I was still utterly fucked, and worst part of the trip hadn't even happened yet. For some reason, I felt like I needed to leave the room, I don't know what it was, I just felt trapped where I was, like the walls were caving in on me or something, I don't know. I stood up from my position and instantly felt kinda sick. I felt as if I was extremely tall and was hunched over the ceiling, looking down at the entire room from where I was stood, it was an extremely strange sensation and it made it extremely hard to find my footing and walk. I was helped through the hallway, and by this point the party was in full-swing, I could hear music blasting and everyone having a great time downstairs. 'Why didn't I just get an E?' I remember asking myself. As I sat down in the next room, the trip began to intensify further.I literally began to forget things about myself, I remember forgetting who I was, what my mother looked like, where I lived, what the outside of the house I was in looked like, everything. I also kept seeing my face for split seconds as I looked around, and I looked terrified. I was terrified, I thought I was stuck the way I was forever, or going to die, and I couldn't remember anything at all, I could barely remember who my friends even were. And to be honest, I didn't even know what a friend was. I remember C telling me, 'It's just the acid, it's just the acid' as I was panicking and I was processing what he was saying, but I didn't know what it meant. I tried to remember what acid was, and I knew it was a drug, but I didn't know what a drug was. It was so strange, my brain was still making links between words, (eg, acid - drug, cat - animal) but it was like the words had no meaning. my brain was still making links between words, (eg, acid - drug, cat - animal) but it was like the words had no meaning. While all this was going on B was downstairs on his own, he was having the same trip as me but he had nobody to help him through it as H and C weren't allowing the countless people that were trying to check on my well-being into the room. That included B, they didn't know he was having a bad trip, and the first few times he tried to come into the room, he wouldn't tell them, either. Eventually though, I heard his voice say 'I'm feeling like J's feeling!' and instantly linked it to his face, I don't know, it was weird. It was as if I was connected to him in some way because we were both on acid. 'Let him in, let him in!' I remember saying, H and C obviously obliged and allowed him to come into the room. He was shaking, like I was and he instantly lead on the bed, sweating and breathing shakily just like myself. I remained in the room in my terrified state for the next few hours, other than when I occasionally said I wanted to go outside because I was feeling really trapped, but then realised it was no better than being inside and that I felt more secure indoors anyway. Eventually, I remember zoning out on my friends bed, and I began to come around a bit. Loads of people were constantly coming into the room to make sure I was alright, and it was making me feel alot better to know people knew about my trip and they actually cared. A large portion of them caring was probably due to the fact that 90% of them were on E at the time, but nonetheless, it still made me feel good.One of my friends were in the room speaking to another of my friends, and I remember slowly beginning to understand what he was saying. I remember him mentioning facebook, and I instantly recognised what facebook was. I then told my friend to keep talking about normal shit, and he did, it all came slowly flooding back to me, I was able to register what he was saying, and could give him a well structured and understandable reply. The sense of relief that blew over me at that point was almost undescribable, it was as if I'd been put on trial for murder and I'd been proven not guilty. Because I was still under the influence of the acid, it literally felt as if a huge weight had just been lifted off my shoulders. My friend who I mentioned earlier, H, went to the shops and bought me my favourite drink, and I sat on the end of the bed listening to people speak as I sipped. Many people say they have meaningful experiences on acid, and I can honestly say this was a meaningful experience. I felt as if I'd been in some dreadful accident, and had lost the ability to do anything, and as people were helping me, it made me feel as if they were somehow bringing me 'back to life' like I'd been reborn anew. I can't really describe it, nonetheless, it felt kind of spiritual, and I don't normally follow any of that stuff. The rest of the night, I felt really good, simply because I wasn't having a bad trip anymore. B came around at around the same time as me, for those of you who are wondering. The rest of the night was kind of a blur. I just remember walking around being really happy because I was back to 'normal' well as normal as you can be when you're tripping on acid. The fact was, I wasn't terrified, I didn't think I was going to die anymore, and I could walk around and do normal shit again. I even ended up taking an E that night, I didn't really feel it however, I just had some minor jaw clenching. The acid was overpowering the E, as I only really wanted to take a half due to the nights events. Later on in the night, however, I smoked some weed, I must have had around 4 joints. And let me tell you, it was NOT a good idea. I began to feel trapped again, and the floor began to look tilted and strange. Everything began to look really trippy again, nobody's face was morphing or anything like that, but nothing looked normal, and my sense of perception was beginning to die out again. Despite the fact I wasn't forgetting anything and I could still do normal stuff, I still began to freak out a little. Just the visuals alone were enough to remind me of the trip I'd had not even 4 hours before. B smoked some weed too, and he felt the same way as I did.This time, there was nobody around to help us, it was around 6 AM at this point, and nobody was really awake. So me and B decided to take a walk to help clear our heads, it helped, to some extent. But the thought of going inside was still horrible, and we felt as if we were walking on a treadmill the whole time. Every time we looped around our area and got back to the house, we both decided to keep walking - we must have walked past the same group of people at least 4 times. Eventually, we decided to go inside. I went upstairs with my girlfriend, and B was left alone downstairs. We were both still tripping out. I tried to lay down in bed, but it was horrible, the room looked even more titled and I couldn't concentrate on trying to sleep because my mind was still racing. I hung my head out the window for a best part of an hour, as I didn't feel as-trapped with my head outside the window. I simply stared around whilst B was below me in the back garden chain smoking cigarettes. I didn't even have to say anything to him, I knew exactly why he was still outside at 7AM and how he was feeling. Eventually, I managed to get to sleep. I slept from about 8AM to 6PM, and walked home. I had some minor comedown effects, but my guess is that the MDMA contributed greatly towards that. I just kinda felt strange on the way home. But I was still on a really good vibe because of how grateful I was to have escaped that trip and be totally back to normal again. That is all. I'd like to apologise for not having many references to time in this report, it's simply because I honestly had no idea what time it was pretty much the entire night. I didn't have my phone on me, and the first time I looked at the clock and was able to process what it said was around 5AM. The bad trip all in all lasted about 3 - 4 hours. But it felt like much, much longer. It felt like an eternity. This experience took place 4 months ago, and I haven't touched acid since. To be honest, I don't know if I ever will. If I did, I'd do it in a controlled environment this time, not a house party. And I'd definitely only take half a tab. As you may be able to tell, I'm not a very experienced psychedelic user, I normally stick to things like MDMA or weed - for this exact reason.Exp Year: 2016ExpID: 109635Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 17 Published: Dec 13, 2016Views: 3,056    LSD (2) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Large Group (10+) (19) DOSE:  repeatedsmokedCannabis  2 hits LSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:140 lbThis weekend, something happened to me that completely changed the way I look at life in general. I'll just add as a side note: I used to do drugs, from when I was like, 13 up until last year. Then I grew up, and realized that my life was just fine without them. The one drug I hadn't done though (that I wanted to do, at least) was LSD. I reacquainted myself with an old friend who used to give me shrooms pretty cheap and he gave me some acid. Another one of my old friends said he'd do it with me, so I split it between my friend and I.I was pretty nervous, I guess because it had been at least six or seven months since I'd done any kind of drug at all (unless you count alcohol), so my friend and I smoked a few joints beforehand, when we were back at his house. His parents were out, so we each took two hits of LSD there, and hung around for about an hour waiting for the effects to sink in. We got bored of this, and decided to walk to the beach (which was a 20 minute walk from his house).As we walked, we waited for the effects of the acid to start up. I was disappointed at the time, thinking maybe two hits wasn't enough (I was absolutely clueless when it comes to LSD). I was about to ask my friend how much longer it would take when I realized how silent the world was. I stopped walking and listened. There was absolutely no sound at all. I started to freak out a little bit and made my friend stop walking so we could sit down for a minute.My friend said something to me, but I remember his voice sounding extremely distant. I could see his lips moving but it was hard to comprehend that he was saying anything. Finally, he told me we were near the beach and we should start walking again. We continued to walk, but everything seemed weird. The ground beneath me didn't feel solid at all, like I could fall through the center of the earth any minute. We came to an alley which would lead us to the beach, and it looked like a cave. It was really dark, almost pitch black, but it couldn't have been later than 5 or 6 pm.We finally arrived at the beach and the sand was even more strange than the alley. I constantly felt a sucking sensation near my feet. I looked down at the sand and it was really colorful and I could see all kinds of patterns in it, but I kept feeling like it was at the same level as my neck. I told my friend I was sinking so we hurried over to the jetty and sat down on the rocks. The water looked weird too, the waves looked like they were crashing down on top of me, but they were really distorted. I started to get scared again, and I wanted to sit down on the sand. But when I looked out at the stretch of beach, I saw a huge black hole form in between the jetty and the sand that I was scared to cross. My friend grabbed me and pulled me across anyway, and we sat down on the sand.That's when things started to get really scary. I suddenly lost any memory as to where I was, or who I was, or who my friend was I suddenly lost any memory as to where I was, or who I was, or who my friend was. I looked around at the beach and it all seemed very strange to me. The jetty looked enormous, and the water looked as though it was going to swallow me up. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, we got up and started to walk back to my friend's house. As we were walking down the alley, I saw a mangled car sitting by a building I hadn't noticed before. The car seemed to come to life, and I became afraid of it. I continued to walk past it, and turned out of the alleyway, which had seemed extremely dark and morose.It was then I realized my friend wasn't with me anymore and I thought the monster-car had eaten him. I felt lost, I had no idea where I was. I was so confused and scared, so I grabbed my phone and dialed the first number that came up on my contacts, which happened to be my girlfriend. She didn't answer and I just started to cry, I felt like I was dying. I fell over in the middle of the street and lay there. I knew I was about to die. I called my girlfriend again, and just kept dialing until my phone battery died. At first I thought she'd answered and I started shouting into the phone. When I didn't hear anything back, I realized the phone was turned off. I rolled over onto my back and stared up at the sky. The clouds were moving closer and closer to me, and suddenly a bright light shined through a break in the clouds. I'm dying, I thought. I'm dying and this is god bringing me to heaven I started calling out to my family and friends, telling them that I love them, and that I'm sorry. I felt my body lift up towards the light. I called out to god, praying and crying out that I don't want to die this way. please god, please let me see my girlfriend again.Suddenly, I heard a very loud roar and the light above me dimmed. I realized I was standing and there was a car coming towards me. At first I thought it was a cop, but I recognized a friendly voice when he called out my name through the window. The door opened I saw my girlfriend and two of my guy friends, as well as my other friend who had been on acid with me. I was so happy to see him, to see people I recognized and loved. My friend helped me into the car and drove us back to his house, where he calmed us down and kept us in his basement until we came down from the trip.This experience helped me realize a lot of things. For one, bad shit like this can happen to anyone, which is why I'm hating myself now for doing acid in the first place after giving up drugs. Just because you haven't had a bad trip yet doesn't mean you aren't going to. I've been on numerous shroom trips and none of them have been nearly as bad as this one. That feeling, that I was going to die was the worst, most painful and terrifying feeling I'd ever felt in my life. Once I came down, the first thing I did was tell my girlfriend that I love her. The second thing I did was call up my dad and step mom and tell them I love them too, as well as my brothers and sisters. I never want to go through an experience like that again.Exp Year: 2007ExpID: 66421Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 8, 2017Views: 1,616    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:002 hitssublingualLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:151 hitsublingualLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:150 lbI took the first two hits around Midnight at a local park in my subdivision.  About 15 minutes later, I began to notice the streetlights looked a lot brighter.  It looked as if there were spiked rainbows coming off of them. If I looked at them, I felt myself 'fall' into them. It seemed like they would put me in a trance.  I began to feel really introspective and didnt talk much.  This state lasted for about thirty minutes, but nothing really 'trippy.'  I figured it was because the acid was weak, so I took a third hit.About 20 minutes after that, I started to feel really awkward.  The best way to explain this feeling was that my arms were really long, and my legs were really short.  My thoughts began to race back and forth, I couldn't focus on anything for more then about 10 seconds.  I began to lose grip with myself.  I could no longer remember who I was or where I was.  I felt disconnected from everyone and everything around me.  The only way I could really hang on to my ego was by talking to the people I had around me (we'll call my friends 'A' , 'J' , and 'W').  This feeling scared me alot.I kept wondering if the acid I had just taken was turning me into something different, and no matter how much I tried to stop thinking about this, my thoughts kept coming back to that.  I tried to tell myself, it is only the acid, I'll be back to normal in a little while, but how long would a little while last? I turned to W to ask him what time it was, and how long had I been  on the acid, he told me 'Its a little after one.... and you've only been on the first two hits for about 45 minutes.' I almost had a heart attack! How could this be? Only 45 minutes? It had seemed like eternity.  How could I go on like this? I don't know if it was me panicking, or if it was the acid taking full effect, but I began to see airplanes in the sky.  They were shooting each other down, then diving towards the ground where I was laying.  A told me to 'blend' with these things, to make myself one of them and take part in the fighting.  How could I?  How could I fly a plane when I couldn't even stand on my own two feet?  Everything was horribly out of proportion, the houses around the park seemed massive, the cars that drove by seemed like ants.I asked W what time it was, he replied '1:15'.  I was stuck in a hellish nightmare... after his response, I blacked out into what seemed like a dream.  I could look around and see nothing except a black space.  From out of no where, I saw what I thought was myself (thinking back on it, I think it is what I perceived my soul to look like at the time) I was horribly disconfigured.  My arms were attached to my waist, my neck seemed very long and protruded up from my waist rather then my shoulders (my shoulders were non-existant), and my legs seemed short and stubby.  I could see above the image of myself the word 'Me' with a question mark above it.  I broke into tears and couldn't stop crying because I couldn't think of who I was.This lasted what seemed like days. (Later I talked this whole event over with W and I was laying face down in the grass crying for about and hour.)  After waking up from this horrible dream, I asked everyone around me what had just happened and they told me I had just rolled over on the ground and cried for about an hour.  This answer (for some reason) satisfied me, and I began to feel better (but at this time, better just meant I wasn't fearing for my life).  I was still very paranoid and I felt a spinning feeling in my head.  W and A decided to drive me back to A's house (which was right inside the subdivision) to try and get me to calm down and enjoy what was left of the acid.  The drive (needless to say) was horrifying.  Everytime we'd speed up, I felt myself falling into the seat and through the car.  When we finally got back to A's house, A and W smoked some marijuana and I sat there, very mellow and watched.  I began thinking really hard about who I was, what kind of morals I held, and what kind of person I want to be. I finally found myself after about an hour of hard thought.   I was still hallucinating, but at that point in time, it seemed so normal that the things I was seeing didn't bother me at all.  I went back inside and started feeling warm and glowy, and stayed up writing and drawing things I had seen in my trip. All in all the acid trip gave me a better insight of who I am.  Before this, I never thought about my actions and what kind of consequences they could bring about. Now, I'm a lot more concerned about my actions and how they will effect other people or how other people think of me.Exp Year: 2005ExpID: 49117Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Sep 2, 2017Views: 1,044    LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:001 hitoralLSD  T+ 8:00  smokedCannabis  T+ 0:001 tabletoralMelatoninBODY WEIGHT:110 lbNOTE: This report was written a few days after my initial trip with a few updates made after.  BACKGROUND: I've considered myself a sort of depressed and anxious person for a very long time, but lately I've been doing relatively well. I have never felt that my mental health was poor enough to warrant a therapist or medication, and I did not think that I have enough legitimate problems to cause a bad trip. DROPPINGMy three friends and I dropped what was supposedly 125 mics of LSD around 2:30 pm at one of their houses. The girl (E) had four or five trips under her belt while the boys (S and V) had only tried 1/3 tab each before. It was my first time. We played a card game while we waited for the effects to kick in. Just as I began to understand the rules, I was no longer able to play because everything seemed so damn funny. One of my friends claimed he wasn't feeling anything at all, but his pupils looked like saucers. Even though I believed him, this notion was hilariously ironic to me. After about thirty minutes of tear-inducing laughter, everything suddenly ceased to be as amusing.  I felt almost sober. I tried to eat a cookie but it didn't taste like much and was very dry and weird. We messed around with this game (don't know the name) where you manipulate the music and the environment. I just kind of watched while S and V talked about how the human brain interprets lines as environments, seeing patterns in what is essentially nothing. S thanked V for the (like 2 hr long) conversation and claimed that it was allowing him to stay grounded in reality. V said he felt the same. I didn't really know what they were talking about. Instead of having racing thoughts like they were describing, my mind felt empty and foggy, like any thoughts I tried to make had to slug through molasses before they registered. I didn't understand how one could even begin to stray from reality on this drug. E talked to me a little about the enhanced colors and distortion effects. I could only really notice the distortion when I was looking at uniform lines, and I couldn't tell if colors looked slightly brighter or if I was just being more perceptive because I thought they would. I had no idea what she was talking about when she said things looked like they were melting. The only effects I noticed were that I kept thinking that a stuffed seal was a real dog and that a green bag was a kid wearing a minecraft creeper hoodie when I saw them out of the corner of my eye. This was only mildly entertaining at best. I felt very bored and kind of lonely this whole time. Soon a sober friend dropped by and offered to take us for a ride before he had to go to work, and I readily agreed so that we'd have something to do. I sat in the middle seat in the back between the two boys, S and V. The sober friend, T, rolled down the windows, opened the skylight, and played some bass-heavy chill electronic music very loudly. I tried to ask T to turn it down but he just kind of scoffed at me, and E seemed shocked that I do not like loud music. And so, my request was denied. T drove through some scenic back roads. V stared out the window. S sat on my left looking pensive. E kept taking photos of perfectly ordinary 'beautiful' clouds through the skylight. I just kind of freaked out. The car seemed much more spacious than I had previously noticed, which would normally be comforting, but up until the point I had been convinced that I was essentially sober, so the fact that my sense of reality could be distorted without me even realizing it jarred me. I had been convinced that I was essentially sober, so the fact that my sense of reality could be distorted without me even realizing it jarred me. My ears felt stuffed with sound, and everything seemed so big and overwhelming. I tried to talk to the others but I couldn't speak over the music, and my inability to communicate caused me some distress. A surprising amount of people were out on the streets. I felt really conspicuous, what with the teenager-filled car blasting music as we went through small neighborhood roads. I was very glad when we returned home.I sat around drawing for an hour before I got bored again. I felt very antsy and very lonely. I am not an affectionate person, but I wanted someone to hold me. My mind was still empty. I wanted to go outside, but no one wanted to go with me, so I went by myself. I sat on a bench for a couple of minutes, but I was no more intellectually stimulated and no less alone. I went back inside. We ate microwaved pizza around 8. We weren't really hungry, but we knew that we should eat. It didn't taste bad, but it felt kind of slimy and the act of moving food around with my tongue seemed really unnatural. I then hugged S while he was talking. He didnt react. Afterward, we walked to the lake (20 minute walk, tops) and looked at the lit up boat docks. They were pretty, but no more than usual. E also found a wild cockroach in the street. She tried to pick it up, which I found disgusting and terrifying, but no more than usual. We sat under a tree and felt the breeze while looking at the stars. It was very nice, but still no more than usual. I was very underwhelmed by the trip. I noticed that I was seeing patterns appear in the grass and and the stars start to rotate, but I dismissed these visuals as nothing, since they were very mild and I thought it was too far into my trip for me to be peaking. We returned home and decided to smoke weed around 10:30, 8 hours after dropping, which I assumed would be safe. However, I weigh roughly 110 pounds, have next to no tolerance to marijuana, and do not usually react well to weed. So this was indisputably an awful, terrible, no good idea. But I ripped that bong anyways. POST WEEDI took my second hit, and it was fucking huge. I was already a bit out of it from the first, but the second made me start coughing and gagging a little. I left the bathroom and flopped on S's chair. I remember barely being able to see (like when you suddenly stand up, but worse) and V coming over to ask me if I was alright. I don't remember what I said in reply. At around this point I began to 'hallucinate.' It was more like vividly imagining, only I had no control over what I was seeing or my reaction. The first thing I remember after I briefly blacked out was being trapped in my own thoughts. I felt as if I were being 'forced' to have certain thought patterns. I was spitting out code, the basic code that codes for feelings and responses to stimuli. But my brain's code was broken. A frame corresponding to a code word would flash in my vision, and then the next, and the next, and so forth. For the most part, these happened incredibly quickly, like frames in a movie, 24-30 per second, but often consisted of a slow buildup before it reached full speed. Chains of code would result in an incredibly intense feeling that would build up in my mind and exit via my temples in an almost painful fashion. The final strength and length of each chunk of code varied, but generally became stronger and stronger as time passed, progressing from an uncomfortably intense feeling to a feeling akin to extreme overstimulation via vibration, like a painfully strong orgasm. At this point I was rambling that I was a computer simulation and shuddering/twitching/seizing up whenever a particularly intense wave came upon me. I was convinced that our brains are essentially incredibly complex computers that function on a system of multiple inputs as code (as opposed to binary, which has 0 and 1, or DNA, which has GCAT, brains have dozens of different code words such as blue, square, and five, all of which I remember saying out loud robotically).As I experienced the primal coding of my human brain going haywire, I felt like a robot. I understood that human consciousness is just a result of electrical impulses in a fleshy computer, and I was thoroughly aware of the simplicity of it. This made me feel unworthy, like a disgusting and lowly creature.  Realizing this would not have been concerning in the least if I was not convinced that my brain code was completely wrecked from me taking LSD. In the worst part of my thought loop, I was a slave to the code. I would think a thought, which coded for the next thought, which coded for the next, and I could not stop. My brain was becoming overloaded, causing it to lag heavily. Back in reality,  everyone else was feeling similarly overwhelmed. S and V found that they had little control over the direction of their thoughts. V thought it would be a good idea to put some music on, and asked for suggestions. S requested 'light comedy music' (???) so V put on the Book of Mormon soundtrack. (I did not learn of this until later.)In my consciousness, my brain lag made the song seem really awfully out of time, like it was switching time signatures every bar. It sounded like the worst song I'd ever heard. I asked V to turn off the 'cowboy music.'I was vaguely aware that control of my main train of thought has been wrested from me by my broken biology. I became increasingly convinced that these loops of broken code were what people in vegetative states (or with schizophrenia) experience and the reason for why they are not all there. I somehow also convinced myself that my subconscious would take control of my body for me and have me continue my life as a paranoid schizophrenic, guiding me through life with my basic animal instincts, while my actual ego would remain trapped in this infinite loop. I began to consider death as an outlet, a way to escape, but I quickly came to the conclusion that this was exactly what death was like, only death was guaranteed forever. I cryptically and said 'Death is this' at one point. This went on for what seemed like at least 4 or 5 hours (though I'm pretty sure it didn't even last 20 min in actuality). Eventually I was no longer stuck in a timeless dimension and was again fairly aware of my friends around me, though I kept fading in and out of reality. I told them to kill me if I ever tried to do this again. Several times. The codes were still flashing in my imagination. Each code from before began to correspond to a pattern. Patterns were the building blocks of everything. The world is made entirely of patterns. The universe is made of patterns. DOGS are made of patterns. This realization completely shattered my worldview. I couldn't believe, I REFUSED to believe, that this whole time, dogs were just patterns, yet I knew this fact to be indisputably true. My entire life felt like a lie. The patterns kept flashing by until my mind's eye zoomed out. I could see that they were all flashing by on a stream, like a film reel, which warped and transformed into a stereotypical psychedelic tunnel. I was shooting down this multicolored roller coaster track of sorts and began to get lost in my own past.I started remembering things from my childhood and the way I thought when I was a child. I remembered how I perceived and what I thought of stoners, recalling all this in the form of intrusive 90's skater dude montages. I was incredibly ashamed and angry at myself for ever abandoning the strong morals I had and becoming a piece of shit stoner. I hated my friends for doing it too. I hated the pseudo-intellectual bullshit they were spewing and I hated myself for involving myself with them. I thought about what held our friend group together and my reasons for staying and I hated it all.  I began to grow angry at them- angry to the point of loathing them. I felt a great amount of contempt for S's acid-induced pseudo-psychology. How could he think what he said was profound? How could he laud this drug for its introspective properties when I didn't feel shit before I toked up? What was I doing hanging out with him? And what was I doing hanging out these other people? We had long stopped doing anything together but smoking weed. I only hung out with the female in the group because I, along with every single one of my friends, had a massive crush on her. I hated her for manipulating me and leading me on, but not as much as I hated myself for being such a beta fucking cuck and failing to see that she simply wasn't ever going to see me as more than a friend. I felt like not only a piece of shit stoner, but also a shitty fedora-donning neckbeard for ever pining for her like I did. I simmered in loathing for everyone and everything, particularly myself. I felt as if I had let down my family by doing drugs. I would check my phone desperately, making sure that in the meantime I would not let my mother down by not responding to her if she ever texted. I wished I had chosen conformity over shitty rebellious teenage drug use. However, as I thought about what my life would be like as a 'normal' person, I felt anguish thinking about how empty and meaningless it would be. I continued riding the rainbow half pipe of patterns, images, explosions, and half soggy crackers, hating myself more and more every time I realized how classically 'psychedelic' of a trip I was having, equating myself to the likes of Shaggy and Ashton Kutcher. I desperately wanted the trip to end, but every time I wished for peace, I'd be reminded that when I was sober, I'd have to return to my piece of shit boring life. I was having an unbelievably awful trip, yet I believed that real life was immeasurably worse. I became incredibly disgusted with society and human behavior. Thinking about how we exploit others for our own selfish gains, I wisely proclaimed 'we all sell CATS for a living.'At some point I calmed down considerably and was moved to the couch. I took some melatonin and rested my head on V's lap and continued to loathe my piece of shit meaningless life and the meaningless relationships I had with my piece of shit friends, while relying on V's sick babysitting skills and feeling concerned for E, who was also having a hard time and seeing everything like it was an animated film.Within about 30 minutes I almost completely stopped feeling anxious. I sat up and tried to explain what happened to me but my brain was too fried to function. Everything that happened in the past 3 hours seemed like a faraway dream, and every once in a while, I'd remember what had just happened to me. It was really hard to comprehend the fact that I actually experienced that, that I was trapped in cerebral hell. I will not be smoking weed or doing acid for a long time. And I will never mix the two again. If I do, please, kill me.Update: 2 weeks laterFor a few weeks after my trip, thinking about what happened to me left me pretty spooked. It was (and is) hard for me to look back and think that that ACTUALLY happened to me. I managed to smoke weed once (a small amount) and had a very enjoyable time, likely because I didn't smoke myself into the state where it feels as if I am no longer myself. This is surprising because I have been rather anxious regarding my well-being when smoking or tripping again, especially because I consider the kush to be the main cause of my bad trip. However, lately I feel my condition has deteriorated. Though I have spent much time pondering my trip, as of late, thinking about it causes me to doubt my reality. My belief that what I experience isn't really real fluctuates in intensity, and during a time when I don't really feel affected, such as the time of writing this, it is difficult to relate to and remember my feelings during my delusions. Even so, I will attempt to write about them. I am especially prone to this state of mind when thinking about my trip or near my druggie friends. Wednesday, two days ago, was when I first noticed the effect was getting scarily pronounced, and I found myself wholeheartedly believing that the world around me wasn't truly legitimate. I found myself wholeheartedly believing that the world around me wasn't truly legitimate. What made it fake, I can't exactly describe. The primary factor was that the trip had shown me that my brain is completely capable of deceiving me and of showing me falsities. At times I am sure that the world around me is merely a construction of my subconscious. A second factor is that the behavior of my friends seems so canned and so fake, that I cannot believe them to be genuine. This type of fakeness is almost exclusive from the other, as the former relies on the assumption that everyone is as genuine as they could be, since they are and have always been part of the simulation, and the the latter assumes that my friends are real but simply acting in a formulaic and manufactured manner. Despite this apparent dichotomy, somehow both notions coexist in my mind.Though I'm sure that if I'm in a delusional state that everyone I talked to would seem similarly fake, so far, I mostly feel this way towards my druggie friends, with the only non-druggie exception I can recall being my little sister. Thursday during lunch, I felt entirely convinced that the world was a simulation constructed by some malevolent being who put me in a coma and was controlling my dreams. The topic of my trip happened to come up during one of my 'episodes'. V joked about me being messed up because of the experience. I not-really-jokingly-but-in-a-nonetheless-joking-manner replied, 'I'm ruined,' and he asked for clarification. I told him that I am constantly questioning reality. He laughed at me and asked for clarification, saying that I said that before and that I'd never actually explained what it meant. I hated his fake canned response and I hated myself for thinking that opening up to a construct of the simulation would make me feel better. The feeling did not go away until about an hour later, when I was able to take my mind off things. Today I did not feel particularly terrible. Semblances of this delusion appeared throughout my day, one even prompting me to write this, but I was mostly okay. I was able to tell myself 'don't be silly, all this is real' and halfway believe it. During an episode, I am almost always able to tell myself that, but I always get the very strong feeling that I am lying to myself. Update 1.5 months laterAlmost immediately after that last report I got better, and I haven't felt super weird like that since. I'm considering doing LSD again, but I get the feeling I'll regret it.Exp Year: 2016ExpID: 108504Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 17 Published: Oct 4, 2017Views: 3,808    LSD (2) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Hangover / Days After (46), First Times (2), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD 2 hitssmokedCannabisBODY WEIGHT:150 lb[Erowid Note: Some authors report suspicions that their cannabis has been 'laced' (adulterated), in some cases, presumably with PCP. While this is possible, readers should be aware that idiosyncratic response to the effects of cannabis (usually higher doses) can lead some users to presume their cannabis has been 'laced'. There is no way to know if the cannabis in the report below was adulterated or not. Reports of plant material and cannabis laced with powerful synthetic cannabinoids and other psychoactive substances became more common starting in 2007.] I had met a beautiful boy at a music festival show. We hit it off via body language and knew we could possibly hang out, considering we both felt mysterious and appeared alone in a very massive crowd. An experienced LSD user, I am, this was his first time trying it. After the show, we walked along, finally speaking to each other and agreed to stick around as buddies the remainder of that night. I would tripsit while looking for wares with him, possibly finding us more.After a good hour of hanging out and walking around, we finally found my dosage with a confused man on the field. I bought two, having been conned several times prior, and ate those. After walking around indecisively some more, waiting for things to kick in, he saw a show he looked interested in to which we made our way over to. Standing at the back, watching glowsticks and beachballs etc fly around, I heard him say 'wow, I wish we were closer!' I said 'why can't we be?' and we began to make our way through the packed crowd and dust. After 20 minutes of being near the stage and dancing, I saw two men with camelbacks on who we made small talk with between song pauses. Eventually, the dust got the better of us and I inquired some water from the man's pack next to me. He cheerfully gave both of us a sip and went back to dancing wildly. As soon as I swallowed the water and watched my friend swallow his, I realized how metallic it tasted. I thought for a second that maybe it was the dust sludge making its way down my throat, but then it hit me- the water was heavily laced with something. In this case, it was more acid, which we were already on and I was not afraid of. After a while longer, keeping calm and getting into the music with my new friend, the men in front of us handed us a bowl between songs. I gladly obliged, as weed would calm me down, I thought. We each took two rips off the bowl and went back to talking with the other guys and each other. The music began and I started dancing. After about five minutes, I took a pause and looked around. The air looked very cloudy and I realized that the dust was beginning to get the better of me. Then, after looking upwards at the rafters above the stage, I took notice that everything was beginning to shift back and forth with a silhouette of 9 after it. Everything seemed intense and I tugged at my friend, signalling to leave. The next half hour was spent in a disassociative daze, partially scared out of my wits and searching for water and partially trying to consistently calm my nerves and figure out what other substance I was on that was causing this. After a while, I noticed that my new friend was even more disassociated than I was and brought this to his attention. I asked him if he still knew that he was on acid and he managed to finally reply 'this feels different than earlier.' This confirmed it and we realized that even with a larger dose of LSD, this was not normal. I eventually managed to find drinks and figure out that the bowl passed to us earlier wasn't full of weed after all, but rather- PCP. One of the substances I always promised myself never to try. For a good two hours, we tried our hardest to find our way out of the festival and back to our tents in what I could only consider to be 'movie trippy'. Voices distorted to slow-motion pitches and everything trailed pinks and purples. After a second or two of sitting under a tree, trying to figure out how not to go towards the direction of the brightest object in sights, a ferris wheel, but rather in the opposite direction of it, a very strung out man came right up to me. After a second or two of trying to figure out what he was asking me, I noticed that he was making a heaving motion, getting ready to puke right on me. His face looked monsterly and I completely realized that he was going to hurl and motioned him away from me, shocked at the fact that this substance impaired my ability so much that I would've let myself be puked on. This flared the trip for me and I went into 'bad trip mode'. I grabbed my friend by the hand and told him 'we need to GET OUT OF HERE.' he obliged, still out of it. After explaining to a few security guards that I distinctly needed help finding my way out of there, one figured out how fucked up we were and explained very detailed on how to go out, making mention to -not- go towards the ferris wheel. I thanked him profusely and he let me do a straightshot through VIP rather than the half-hour+ it would've taken to go around it, to get back to my campsite. When we finally arrived, my friends I came to the festival with greeted us and we all conferred that it wouldn't have been as bad if I had the courtesy of at least knowing what I was on. Thankfully, I've read enough to know what effects were taking place and how to avoid something horrible from happening. The rest of the night was more of an apology to my newfound friend than anything else. I persuaded him to not steer away from lsd in the future, assuring him that it was the pcp which made me into an unusually bad time, not the other kindly substance which we had both remembered to treat us so well in the beginning. He took my heed and departed and to this day, I realize that if ever given the chance to try pcp again, I wouldn't object considering I know its effects firsthand and find them only disagreeable when immersed in a completely unfamiliar experience, setting, and company.Exp Year: 2007ExpID: 66662Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 8, 2017Views: 2,493    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), What Was in That?

Crowd (24) DOSE:440 ugsublingualLSD(blotter / tab) .5 joints/cigssmokedCannabis(plant material) 600 mginsufflatedKetamine(powder / crystals)BODY WEIGHT:67 kgI had done several drugs before this experience; I smoked a lot of weed every day and used other substances regularly. I'd done LSD before. I dropped a 220ug tab and it turned out to be one of the best experiences of my life. I'd also done a fair bit of Ketamine before. Beforehand I wasn't nervous at all, in fact, I was feeling quite confident; I thought I had enough experience with these drugs, but I didn't know what I was in for.I dropped two 220ug tabs about 21:00, I was accompanied by my 14y/o step-brother who'd done a bit himself at the same time. The acid took about 40-45 minutes to kick in I started by getting some faint visuals. My step-brother had some stickers on his wall and almost simultaneously we said: 'Are the stickers peeling off?'. Although I knew they weren't I got up to check, low and behold they were flush against the wall. It was then I noticed the ceiling seemed lower and the corners of the room were curved.About half an hour later I phoned my friend and I was in a very happy, loving mood I kept saying 'I love you'. After the call finished I forgot who I just talked to, confused, I decided to look in my contacts list. I didn't recognize a single person. After this I went into my room for a bit to play guitar, the fretboard was pulsating and each note resonated and sounded beautiful I went back into my stepbrother's room and he was really scared because he'd never done LSD before.We sat on his bed for about 20 minutes, tripping balls, not saying a word. Finally, he broke the silence and said: 'What do you want to do now?'. I asked him if he wanted to smoke some weed so I got him to roll a joint (strain: Critical Mass) because I wasn't in the state too. Whilst he was rolling he asked if I had any ket, so I went to my room to get some. When I walked through the door I forgot what I came in for so I went back to ask my step-brother what I was looking for. I did this 3 more times and finally, I had to keep saying 'Ketamine' so I could remember. We smoked this joint out his bedroom window and listening to trippy music, I felt happy as Larry.[Erowid Note: The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] Next, I asked my stepbrother to cut up some lines of ket and since he'd never snorted anything before he had made the biggest lines I had ever seen (although I didn't realize he'd used all of it). The 0.6g was split into 3 lines, he snorted one and I did two. The weird part is the next day I found out he didn't do any ket at all but I finished it all by myself. I couldn't get my head around it - I clearly saw him do a line.10 minutes later the K hit me hard and my vision went bug-eyed. Then I couldn't see the outside world at all, instead, I was seeing trippy images - sort of thing you'd see if you looked it up on the internet. My step-brother was speaking to me but I couldn't reply or move as I was in the K-Hole. My step-brother announced he was going to bed, so after a while, I managed to move again. He led me into my room, onto my bed and turned my light off. This was when things got bad.I would've turned on my light because I was getting scared had I not have been paralyzed, so I just lay there tripping very hard. About an hour passed when everything got bad. What I was seeing slowing starting fading into white, then I saw a light. That classic light at the end of the tunnel stuff, so I approached it. Then... I went blind. I couldn't see anything and I slowly I lost the feeling of my body. It was the scariest thing that had ever happened to me. I had lost all my senses. I kept thinking 'Am I dying?'. Then my mind went dead. This bit is hard to explain unless it happens to you. I couldn't think, but I knew I had died and I stayed like that for what felt like an eternity.I don't remember coming back around, in fact, I don't remember much at all after that. except I stayed up until 10:00 - because I was too shaken to sleep. When morning came and light returned to my room I was still tripping. The visuals made me feel sick, like when you get very drunk and you smell alcohol the next day. My brain was fried and I felt grotty, and the for the next 3 days I had trouble sleeping because of what had happened. This experience made me reconsider my drug use. I was shocked when my stepbrother told I had done all the Ketamine without realizing. It scared me and I thought that me 'dying' could be foreshadowing a later event in life as a result of drug use.Exp Year: 2017ExpID: 110940Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 15 Published: Jan 12, 2018Views: 2,604    LSD (2), Ketamine (31) : Combinations (3), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Hangover / Days After (46), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:3 hits LSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:125 lbIt was a Monday evening after school when my buddies G and N told me that they just got word from our dealer that he's got A great deal on some Storm-trooper acid tabs. My buddies and I were all experienced trippers (so I thought). I tripped around 8 times, N around 10 and G about 7. This time I wanted to take 3 I've only taken 2 at most in the past which I thought was the Perfect dose, but N said I should at least just experience 3 one time, so I did. My buddies and I drove up to meet our guy to get the tabs, I got my 3, N his 2 and G his 2. I wanted to wait and trip with my other buddies D and A on the weekend coming up but it was a Thursday morning when I ended up staying home 'sick' I thought it would be the perfect time.On that Thursday morning I made a dumb decision, I popped the 3 in with a positive but also slightly nervous feeling. I sat on my computer reading through some articles about news and listening to music, 25 minutes in I felt it, I realized then what I was In for. It was 6:35 a.m when I took the tabs. Once I really started feeling it I decided to relax in bed and watch the new X-MenDays of Future Past, and boy was that something...the color's were unbelievable, the feelings were amazing this in my head.Was the coolest experience I've ever had. After the movie was done I got up and just starred out my window looking at the sky, the trees, my pool, the cars passing behind my house. I was astonished by everything I was seeing, and a weird thoughtpopped into my head. I thought about some of the people I knew and how they had to grind for what they have. I know people who have barely anything with crazy screwed up lives...no parents, no money, barely a roof over their head, but me? Well I had everything my parents were still together, I had money, I had a roof over my head, I was spoiled. All those thoughts just clicked in my head and I started bawling my eyes out harder than I ever had before because I treated my parents like sh*t even though they did everything for me and I realized how lucky I was. All those thoughts just clicked in my head and I started bawling my eyes out harder than I ever had before because I treated my parents like sh*t even though they did everything for me and I realized how lucky I was. This was the life changing part in my trip because after this, I treated my parents with so much more respect and rarely ever talked back to them...they had no idea that LSD was the change to that.Now on to where my trip went from excellent to terrible in the matter of seconds...it was 7 hours into my trip, I was texting my buddy D and telling him about it, he then replies with 'Bro, how are you still tripping that hard? You should've reached your peak by now?' After reading that text I thought for some reason my brain was fried for the rest of my life, I thought I would be tripping forever...And even though in the middle of the trip I knew that it was just the Acid I couldn't control it...I was freaking out. I lost my mind, I would go from my bed, to my computer chair, to walking back and fourth repeating my name...address...middle name just to keep myself from thinking I'm crazy...At that point I just wanted to talk to someone, I NEEDED someone. My brother, and dad were home BUT I knew if I were to say a word to them they would think I'm crazy, and to me at the time I thought I would just stay in my perpetual loop and end up in a mental institution. It was finally 2:45 p.m when D got home I made him get on skype to talk and help me. D would ask me questions and I couldn't even respond or barely comprehend what he said...I kept trying to explain what was happening but I couldn't even remember anything...my train of thought was obliterated. Eventually I realized I was stuck in my first acid loop that I remembered reading about. D looked it up and just told me that I had to relax. After a little over an hour my mind was once again stable. After that experience I've never touched drugs again.Exp Year: 2014ExpID: 109688Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 16 Published: Jan 14, 2018Views: 1,612    LSD (2) : General (1), Bad Trips (6), Therapeutic Intent or Outcome (49), Alone (16) DOSE:.5 hitssublingualLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:150 lbBack in October, of 03 me and a friend wanted to try out this acid I got from my dude that looked pretty good.  We only had one blotter,. So we split it in half and dropped them around 12:15a.m..  Now that I think about it and remember what the trip was like, I dont think it was such a smart idea to take it so late.  Due to the surroundings and that it was dark out.  The first hour after I felt it, every thing was amazing.  I was laughing non-stop for no particular reason.To this day I wish I could go back to that night and stop may mind form thinking about things that should have never been on my mind when taking acid (note, that this was my first acid experience).  When tripping I thought about how I had to work the next day and I needed to get some sleep.  Beginning my first time I didn't know about this.  When trying to sleep, I was tossing and turning, and my mind wouldn't stop thinking.  I began to get on the subject of work and thought,' o no' what if I never fall asleep and I'm like this at work.  This thought began to led into other thoughts like if I'm going to be high at work then I'm probably going to be like this forever.  This was the point were my thoughts got way to intense, and the trip became bad.  I was confused and didn't know what I wanted to do, all I was thinking about was ' is this ever goin to end.'  My other friend who I had taken the acid with didn't really feel it to strong because he had done acid before, so he was trying to clam me down and tell me that it was just a drug and it will end eventually.  In my head I thought he was lying to me and I still believed I was goin to be on a permanent acid trip to hell.Like I said earlier it looked like some good acid, and it definitely was.  The trip had lasted from about 12:45a.m.-8:00a.m..  This is the usually length of acid trips, but keep in mind that I only took 1/2 a blotter.The next day after the experience I was finally done tripping, but coming down felt very weird.  My body felt heavy and my thoughts were blurry.The main reason I wrote this, was to let everyone no what had happened to me the next 5 months, after my experience. Also keep in mind that my girlfriend at the time I had been dating for over a year and she was extremely against real drugs.  So when I took the acid I was hiding it from her.  The thought of going behind her back , and feeling guilty about what I had done, may have triggered what happened to me, but I will never no what truly caused it.  I began to feel very distant from others and had that nervous felling in my stomach almost all the time.  I also began to feel like nothing mattered, and strongly depressed.  But these weren't even close to the worst parts of it.  I began to feel like I had no emotions, when ever something funny, or good would happen I felt like I didn't notice it, or like I didn't matter.  I also became nervous when talking to people I had known all my life, and when I would look at people I didn't like keeping any sort of eye contact.  Many of my friends at school noticed something different about me, and that I didn't even seem like the same person.  I lost many friends because of the way it made me act.  My mind felt the same way.  It felt like I wasn't me any more, which made me want to die.Like I said these feelings lasted for 5 months, and I remember crying many times wishing and praying that it would all end, and I could have my normal life back.I'm glad to say that these feelings have left me and I back to my normal state.  I think the reason I stopped felling like this was because I broke up with my gf, and I no longer felt guilty.Thanx to anyone how spend their time reading this, I hope it has helped any one that has had this happen to them before to no that there not the only one, like I thought I was.  I hope no one ever has to go threw what I did, because I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.GanggusExp Year: 2003ExpID: 32645Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 18, 2018Views: 1,000    LSD (2) : First Times (2), Bad Trips (6), Depression (15), Hangover / Days After (46), Relationships (44), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:1 hitsublingualLSD(blotter / tab) 2 hitssublingualLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:160 lbThe first time I tripped was with 3 of my close friends and we all took one hit. This particular blotter acid was a (spider-man) and, obviously had a little picture of the face of spider-man on it. This was a wonderful experience and I felt a sense of closeness to my friends, and it was during the day, cause we had skipped school, and the sky was so big, BLUE, and beautiful. We walked through the woods for a hour just looking at plants and picking flowers and buds off different plants and bushes; I felt a real respect for the beauty and naturalness of nature. Then we came up on a railroad track, and it just so happened that a train came by at that time, and it was loud as hell. And I could feel the ground shaking.  But this isn't the bad experience.The second time I tripped I really messed up. It was a week later from the previous first trip of my life, and I had gotten 3 of these (spider-mans), and from what I had heard from experienced trippers was that these spider-mans were good, and I agreed considering my first trip. I bought 3, one for me, my best friend who I hadn't tripped with and his brother. We had planned to do it on a saturday night. Unfortunately, my parents had planned to go to a nascar race early the nest morning and I had to be there real early at like 5am,so I could watch my little sister. SO I was at home alone, cause my parents were in bed sleeping, and my friend corey and his brother had decided to go to a club since we weren't tripping. I stayed up late that night watching t.v. Cause I was bored and at 12 started to watch 'Space Cowboys', and I was bored and wanted to have some fun and took one spider-man, after and hour into the movie I felt as if it wasn't really effecting me, and being a unexperienced user of acid; not knowing the power of it; and still questing for that true trip, like in the movies and stuff where u have alot of visuals. So wanting more effect I took the other 2. So now I have 3 spider-mans in me and I'm watching 'space Cowboys', I first started to notice that Clint Eastwood's face looked real weird and sort of twisted, and in the movie they're working on this satellite in outer space that is supposedly this Russian communication satellite. But in the movie its a conspiracy, and the satellite is actually this nuclear warhead satellite still up in space from the cold war. Now when this things goes into attack mode, I felt like I was in a dam I-max theatre, and this thing was giant, and I was like ok I'm tripping now, so I turn it off and go to my computer and start to play a computer game called Counter-Strike, but I find myself just staring off into the screen and like breaking down every pixel on the monitor, so return to the television but only to flip through the channels, and note this was only my second time tripping and the first time I didn't have any real visuals, but this time I was in for some.I turn on the T.v. And start to watch ESPN and they have a male aerobics contest. Except I cant hear the announcers no matter how hard I concentrate, I never knew acid could effect the hearing. The contestants are jumping around on stage, moving real fast, but he scary part was all their heads were shaping into demons, and they were growling, so I flip to ESPN2, this one is sportscenter, and as they were showing the highlights all the games were in total slow motion to me, no matter how hard I tried it wouldn't stop moving in slow motion, and then I flip to HBO where they were playing 'Lake Placid', the one with the giant killer crocdile, and the peoples' faces kept shifting, and there skin would peel back off their face into another shape, and I saw some scary scenes that I can't really remember, but now at this point I have this deep dark fear, and not being able to handle it  I decide to try to fight it and just goto bed, so I go upstairs and lie in my bed, I remember just lieing there playing with my hands, and looking at feet which seemed to be a mile away at the end of the bed, I felt a fear that I wouldn't come out of it cause I had taken too much and remember thinking that over and over that I was going to go into a permanent trip, and when my parents got up to get ready for the race I was still tripping lieing in my bed tense and frozen like a stiff dead person trying to pretend I was asleep as my mom came in to my room to say by, but she skipped across the room; and I couldn't even understand the words she said, and as she left I thought about how much I loved her and how mad she would be if she knew of the stupid shit that I do, and my little sister came in and layed with me after my parents left and this was like 7 in the morn, and she noticed that I was wide awake, and she asked me what was wrong and I just began to cry and told her she would never understand, then I got up at took a shower, when I got out I felt so cold and body felt like crap so I layed in bed again, and just went into a daze and I don't know if I fell asleep or not but at like 11am I came to my senses, and got up and was delighted to notice that I wasn't tripping anymore, and my eyes weren't dialated and I could actually think. I swore that I would never trip again, but I have many times since then, but nothing ever close to that night.Exp Year: 2001ExpID: 10726Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 20, 2018Views: 986    LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Alone (16) DOSE: T+ 0:001 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 1:001 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:00  smokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:140 lbI had a pretty traumatic experience with acid about 3 weeks prior to writing this. I had tried LSD once before that but it must have been weak or bunk because I didnt feel much. Anyways, the setting was my friends house, just me and him. I took 1 tab at first, and then another an hour later.The effects of the first tab were just setting in: I was feeling detached from reality and giggly. At about an hour and a half after taking the first tab, I started getting this feeling of intense anxiety. The feeling got worse so I went to sit under his deck and calm down. I thought looking at the trees and nature would help me out. The anxiety became more and more intense as I sat in the chair and I felt completely helpless. I became paralyzed by a feeling of fear. It wasn't about anything in specific but I felt very afraid and anxious. I became paralyzed by a feeling of fear. It wasn't about anything in specific but I felt very afraid and anxious. I had some very intense visual distortions as I looked at the trees. At about 3 or 4 hours after taking the first tab, I started getting hallucinations. I saw a monkey dancing in a tree and a cartoonish type of coyote smoking a cigarette next to me. They were only in my periphery though and would disappear when I tried looking at them. I was paralyzed in this one chair by the feelings for about 5 hours. I couldn't bring my self to get up. I wasn't scared by the hallucinations though. If anything, they distracted me from the overwhelming emotions. I wasn't scared by the hallucinations though. If anything, they distracted me from the overwhelming emotions. When the trip died down at about 5 1/2 hours, I was left with the anxiety. I didn't think much of it at the time, I thought it would wear off.[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] I then went inside to take some bong hits and then drove home. When I got home, I couldnt sleep at all that night. I was so anxious and begining to feel extremely depressed and thought I was loosing my mind. For the next few days I experienced intense anxiety constantly. Prior to this experience, I had never experienced anything close to this level of anxiety. I experienced a vivid flashback several weeks later where I felt like I was tripping again. The intense part lasted only a few minutes but I had a detached kind of feeling for aboout an hour.Exp Year: 2007ExpID: 66686Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 3, 2018Views: 944    LSD (2) : General (1), Bad Trips (6), Hangover / Days After (46), Post Trip Problems (8), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:1 tabletoralMDMA(pill / tablet) 1 cig.smokedCannabis(plant material) 1 tabletoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:132 lbIt started out a fun night, then the sh*t hit the fan...My best friend and I were going to go to a party one friday night. Right before we left we popped our tabs (I had blue dolphin) and rolled a joint. About the time we got to the party my roll got kicked off. I was feeling great. I danced around and started to feel hot. I didnt want to dehydrate so I quickly sat down and started sipping on water. My head started killing me. I went to the bathroom and vommited. I told my friend that I had to go lay down, so I went to the back room and collapsed on the bed. when I woke up about 3 hours later, I was in a cartoon. I didnt know what to think. I thought that I had always been in the cartoon and just didnt notice. everything look like it was drawn. I studied my new surroundings until the thought hit me...do I even existed? Am I someone's creation? I couldnt remember anything of my past life and I wasnt worried about the furture. I lost all perception of everything. I began to walk around and found myself in a room of wet paint being smudged together. I was scared that I would become mixed in with the wet smudge so I quickly left the room. As I entered the living room, demented creatures quickly turned and looked at me all at once. They had swords, axes, maces, spears, and all arrays of medeval weapontry. I was completely frightened. I went to the room were I came from and locked the door. As I turned around I fell into nothingness and came to the conclusion that my creature erased me from existence. I went deep into thought. I could still hear my friends talking to me so I figured that I was on another page then they were. Finally, after life changing thoughts and ecceptance of an eternal nothingness, I went to sleep. I woke up to my friend shaking me. He told me that I asked a dude for some acid and took it and started tripping out. It all come together. My world began to come back together. It's been 3 months since my experience and I still havent fully recovered. I've been having frequent flashbacks that send me back to my horrible doom. Acid has scarred me for life.Exp Year: 2005ExpID: 45115Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 3, 2018Views: 1,335    MDMA (3), LSD (2) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Large Party (54) DOSE:4 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab) 5 joints/cigssmokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:160 lbIt all started on a may night. I had wanted to trip hard on acid but was not at all ready for what would come. I ingested four blotter tabs of LSD and smoked approximately 5 joints. I was prepared for the intense hallucinations, this is why I had wanted to try LSD again. The first time I had 2.5 hits, it seemed like nothing. I had a nice body high and hallucinated for a little, I liked it so much I couldnt wait to try it again. I did and at first it was great. Then crazy thoughts entered my head. Around 4 hours after I had consumed the LSD I thought the apocalypse had come not only that I thought I was at the beach, I thought I won tickets to a concert, I thought a friend of mine was related to the grateful dead. I also thought Bill Gates controlled my head through an electronic chip in the acid. I also at one point thought I could go to the playboy mansion through a portal in the mirror and find and fight this kid through the tv.What scared me the most was that the apocalypse had come, that all good had left me and everyone was trying to strand me in this basement. I then grabbed a lamp and hit this kid with it. I was convinced they were trying to strand me since I thought I was the only one left suicidal thoughts and depression engulfed my brain. I remember thinking about killing myself. The night could have gone completely wrong I could have killed someone or been killed. I cant explain why my body reacted that way, if my brain wasnt prepared or I just react that way to acid. I personally think the first acid I took was weak and I was not prepared for the voices I would hear. Im never trying acid again, something terribly wrong could have gone. I now view life differently I dont know how I think it was because of the suicidal thoughts I had and the depression that occured during that night. I will forever stay away from acid because my body reacted in such a horrible way.  Acid was the worst experience of my life. I remember thinking I was melting and dieing and I wanted to live. I had crazy thoughts in my head and was probably capable of committing a horrible crime. I just thank God nothing bad happened.Exp Year: 2005ExpID: 43465Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 3, 2018Views: 981    LSD (2) : Unknown Context (20), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:2 hitssmokedCannabis(plant material) 1 tabletoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:65 kgI’ve had experience with opiates before (endone, oxycodone), as well as social marijuana useage, alcohol and tobacco. All my life I had wanted to try LSD, the mysterious drug of hallucinations and wonder, and I finally found some. The guy I was purchasing it off is renowned for having the best of drugs, and he told me this was a new, higher-dosed acid he ordered in for me.After school (3:30PM), I changed my clothes and drove with a friend to a dealer’s house. Let’s call him V, and my friend C. When we entered I saw several lounges and chairs around a TV with some crappy show on, and about ten people passing around a bong and just generally laughing. I had two bong hits whilst waiting for my acid to arrive.When the guy arrived, he sold me the little paper tab that would become my misery for the night. I put it on my tongue and swirled it around a little, keeping my chewing gum on the side of my teeth. (4:30PM) The people knew I was taking it and C was eagerly awaiting me to start tripping, himself wanting to try it after I told him what it was like.About ten or twenty minutes later, my heart started beating immensely. I thought it was just nerves at the time. Everyone then noticed my eyes were massively dilated – they took a photo to show me, and I stared into the black dinner plates with surprise and laughed. I then swallowed the piece of paper.Another ten minutes later I started shaking, and my mouth turned extremely dry. I felt very odd, and decided to walk outside and get a drink and lay on the grass (backyard).  I got a drink from the tap and then proceeded to lay down on the grass, but V’s wife immediately got me to come in out of concern I might get seen. I sat down, and within five minutes, it began.I immediately noticed my head getting insanely heavy. I couldn’t resist it, and it pulled it down to my shoulder and I felt my brain dipping its toe into the Tripworld. I snapped out of it immediately, noticing the walls covered in crawling fur, but then my head became heavy again and rolled to the other side, and it ‘splashed’ again, and I mouthed in an exaggerated way “woahh”.For the next thirty minutes, I kept slipping in and out of trip in this stifling room, each trip lasting for longer. The return was like being woken up in the morning, and I was unable to talk or walk. Everyone was watching me in horror/amusement (as in, wow, this guy is tripping balls on acid, I hope he doesn’t murder us) and they all began to fool around with me. I only knew three or so of them, so they didn’t give a shit if I was okay.They poked me, jabbed me, told me I had snakes in my hair and on my shoulders and that I was going to die etc. I didn’t believe any of it, and knew it was all lies, but they continued. When I tried to move closer to someone they would jump away in fear. They were scared of me.C asked me a few times if I was okay, good or bad. I shrugged before slipping back into trips, hitting my head on the TV. My chewing gum felt like a weird paste/powder in my mouth and was very unpleasant.V came out and looked at me, and told C to get me out of there. I understand this, but still feel unhappy about being booted out in the state I was in. I tried to explain I was okay and apologise but all that came out was a baby’s gurgling. I stumbled and fell to C’s car, got in, and had him drive me to my brother’s. I for some reason told him directions that took us on a ten minute wild goose chase, slipping in and out of trip, and he got very unhappy at me.I arrived at my brother’s house, and stumbled across the road in half-trip, trying to compose myself. I walked up the 70-something stairs vigorously, trying to stay out of trip, and walked through the door. My brother (a pot smoker) asked me what I took, and I replied in a daze ‘An LSD’ and he took me to his bedroom and got me a warm glass of water from his en suite. It was very hot in the room. He left and I laid down, and then the trip pulled me in.It’s too much to describe. It’s like looking at a kaleidoscope, or a fractal pattern, or a TV on a channel that just registers fuzz, but infinitely more detailed and focused. And each little grain is a complex image, moving, expanding, enveloping, and it takes all of your focus to just observe this image. Time slows to a crawl. Seconds feel like hours. The whole time a vibration was going through my body, shaking me and hurting, and the sound of an engine was in my head unpleasantly. At this point I knew I was in this for the long haul – I just had to go along with the ride.And I thought. Every second a thousand thoughts each unfolded in my mind, the meaning of life, each little detail about me, all the things wrong and right about me, what I like and what I hate, all unfolded and answered in my head like a debate, all the while this stunning image in front of me. I only slipped out of Tripworld when I heard a noise, or forced myself to, and at this point trips were lasting for around 30 minutes at a time.My brother re-entered the room to check on me and use the toilet. I replied “Mm. Yeah. Ok,” To the things he said, unable to form sentences or focus on his words, knowing that the whole time Trip was waiting to pull me back in and envelope me. I slipped in for a second and forced myself out, and in my mind I wasn’t sure if I hallucinated my brother or if he actually entered the room. I called out his name, and he replied, and this was concerning to me. It was blurring the lines between reality and fiction.At the peak, around 8-9PM, I went into a two hour trip. I thought I was going to die. I lived a thousand lives and discovered everything about myself. I had to record all I was thinking. My first thought was a tube of blue paint on his bedside table. I had already removed my shirt due to the intense heat and sweating I was undergoing, and proceeded to try to write with my fingers on my stomach and chest. I also wrote on my jeans. At some stages I went through euphoric falling sequences of trip. I felt as if my body was falling towards the ground for minutes at a time, and I had the rollercoaster-type euphoria throughout my whole body during this, but afterwards when I ‘hit the ground’ my body became immensely sore and tired.I lost focus easily when trying to complete tasks. For example, when trying to get a sip of water, I’d move halfway to the glass and then trip and fall into the bed, come to, and then go for the water again. Now I decided to record my thoughts in text messages by saving them as drafts. I completely forget writing them, but I read them in the morning and they are both full of gibberish and some rather wise sentiments. (The blue writing on my body was just a smear and dots when I checked, haha)At 10:30PM my brother entered, and I was coming down but still strongly tripping, and told me to go sleep on the lounge because he wanted to go to bed. I obliged in the out-of-trip objective based mentality, where I could only do that one thing, and went and laid on his lounge. When I observed myself in the mirror, I was horrified to observe that I didn’t recognise the person looking back at me. My thoughts were, “Is this who I have been living as all my life? This isn’t the person I know.”Walking while tripping was extremely odd. Whilst on his bed, I noticed my arms moving themselves and hands doing movements above me head without me controlling them, but when I was walking, if I moved my head it would ‘lock’ into that place, and I forgot my body. I was told I was walking on the spot with my eyes closed and tongue out by one of his roommates when trying to walk there after having my head lock in (it happened several times) which he found amusing.I was still going in and out of trip, but I was strongly aware that it would be over. I sat out on his balcony, overlooking the beach in a nice breeze, and another of his roommates came out and started playing acoustic guitar. It sounded incredible. The music echoed all around me, and I sat very reflective of my experience, and ate several Doritos. Tastes are all changed around, and everything feels powdery or dry in your mouth.I finally achieved sleep at about 12:30AM, and in the morning I was still noticing the fractal patterns when looking at anything, as if halfway between my eyes and the world like a filter, and this was off-putting. Walking also gave me the same ghostish feeling, as if I was drifting through and it was all a dream. I walked home that morning and had a shower and slept. My body and mind were both exhausted. For the rest of the day I noticed sparkles and glitter over everything and this was enjoyable to observe.LSD is incredibly powerful. I had a bad trip, under bad circumstances, with very strong acid. Whilst I do not regret this, it has put me off of drugs for quite a while – I did not realise the strength they actually have and the torment they can inflict on the unprepared user. In summary, I will leave some notes for a potential LSD-user to think about (I will not be held accountable for my words, this is not advice, just what I have learnt).Exp Year: 2011ExpID: 89907Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 8, 2018Views: 1,229    LSD (2) : Various (28), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:12 stI was young at the time, and my parents had gone away for the weekend, so two friends and myself each took one dose (blotter paper) of acid.  We took the stuff in a forest near my house.  It was midsummer, and where I live, it doesn't get fully dark till about eleven.  We sat around for an hour or so, until dusk had set in, but nothing was happening to me and not much to them, so we decided to head back to my house.  Another friend who hadn't taken anything came back too.Soon after we got back, everything changed.  Mainly, I began to feel nauseous, and I was hungry too, but there wasn't a hope in hell that I could even comtemplate eating anything.  I went to the bathroom and sat down on the toilet and was horrified to see that my manhood had shrunk to about one inch!!!  After that shock, I was very anxious to rid myself of the general feeling of malaise.  Someone had told us that orange juice is an antidote to acid, so I forced myself to drink a small glass of it... it had no effect.  (I've since read that it's also meant to enhance the trip, so I don't know what's true).Paranoia about being discovered on drugs soon began to set in, so I bundled my tripping friends out of my house and asked my sober friend to stay the night in case I went mental (I thought I would never come back down).  He agreed, but said that he'd need to write a note for his parents, so we walked back to his house so he could leave a note.  At this stage, it was about about 2 am.  I waited outside his house while he wrote the note and it was then that the strangest thing happened me.  I had gotten a few visual effects, such as objects (cars, for example) 'shunting' quickly one way and then straight back, but nothing too impressive.  But I was leaning on a low wall when I heard a man and a woman behind me.  They were talking about me...  The gist of their conversation was how 'awful' it was that I was on drugs and what would his parents think, and so on.  But it didn't just fade away - the conversation continued for minutes!  I know this, because my friend took about five minutes to come back out.  I could hear every word said and two distinct voices saying them.  I was utterly convinced that there were two people behind me engaged in conversation about my trip!  Eventually, I plucked up the courage to look behind me and face them, and when I did, the only thing there were the leaves of a palm tree (or something like it) rustling in the breeze.After that episode, which I simply couldn't believe, we headed back to my house.  I tried to sleep, but it was after 7 am before I managed to get a couple of hours.  I awoke and looked in the mirror - one of my pupils was dilated, the other wasn't...  That wasn't what I needed to see either...  But it returned to normal an hour or two later.It's well-known but very true, one's internal state of mind is very important.  Inner fears may be manifested as external stimuli.I haven't tried acid since.Exp Year: 1996ExpID: 24042Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Mar 9, 2018Views: 874    LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:002 hitssublingualLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 5:003.5 mgoralMushrooms   T+ 5:00  smokedCannabis BODY WEIGHT:130 lbT0:00-Took 2 tabs of acid in a beach house. Leave to go to the beach shortly after.T1:00-Coming up on the acid on the beach-mostly slight body effects such as the familiar feeling of floating. There are shafts of light piercing through the clouds and the entire sky and sea are dancing with patterns. Colors are brighter and everything seems to have a rainbow sheen. Friends decide to go to a diner.T1:30-Perception of sound is very strange in the diner with sounds phasing in and out around me with a sort of Doppler Effect. Patterns are swimming and swirling on every surface, people’s faces are slightly shifting. Everyone looks very very strange- although they are not deformed, it’s as if the human face as it is had suddenly stopped being a familiar and accepted image and became something strange and alien. After lunch I go into the bathroom, where the visuals have become quite apparent- the walls are swirling and swimming around me, pulsing and breathing with harmonious and flowing patterns.T2:20-Leave the diner and go back to the house. I’m getting the awkward social interaction I usually get from acid where I’m hyper aware of my own voice and inflection and in doing so completely lose a sense of how to use tone or inflection properly. Sunlight is filtering in through the windows, colorful rainbow wood grain patterns breathe and emboss themselves on the walls, I feel floaty, confident, euphoric, and my jaw is clenching. I feel awkward and am having trouble articulating sentences and finding the right words to use, so I retire to a quiet hallway to draw pictures by myself.T4:00-The acid trip is tailing off. I can really only feel the physical effects anymore. Visuals and emotional effects are only noticeable if I try to notice them. At this point we’re waiting for the sun to go down so we can smoke weed. My social skills have mostly returned and I feel comfortable and euphoric in the presence of friends.T5:00-The sun is down. We are preparing to go to the beach to smoke. I decide now is the time to take my mushrooms. I eat them with orange juice as a chaser across a period of about 15 minutes and then head to the beach. We struggle to light the bowl in the strong winds but eventually find a way and smoke several bowls.T5:20-I sit down on the beach and stare out into the vast ocean. I can feel my body growing heavier and numbing away as the visuals begin to pick up. Tessellated spiral patterns mirror themselves on the sand and my entire field of vision appears to be mirroring itself and repeating. The light of boats on the horizon are beaming and swirling into the sky. I go back to where my friends are and sit down as they have intense and serious discussions about politics. I wish I could’ve participated but my brain was processing their words in a way that was ineffective for response and comprehension. Whenever I would talk, my voice would sound isolated and dreamy before trailing off into nothing.T5:40-The conversation has shifted to the future, the scope of human progress, the entirety of humanity and its fate, the scope of our universe, of time, of everything leading up to now and everything to come. This is an amazing conversation to be having while on mushrooms and I am more actively and eagerly participating. Human constructs come up a lot, and there is a lot of talk about a new paradigm built from radical reinvention of what we consider human, about utterly dismantling every social and cultural construct and society built anew, aided by technology. As they discuss this, I look to the sky- rippling, pulsing, and exploding with the energy of time and the potential of the future. The town in the distance glows with glorious artificial light of the modern human, the entire earth is expanding around us. The great sky and the expanse of space above me, the vastness of nature on one side, the monuments of humanity on the other. I feel like a small little being on this great planet as it hurtles through time and space. As we talk, my friends begin to glow with auras, my depth perception fails and my entire vision is one flat plane with my friends amidst a sea of swirling, spinning dancing fractals and astral forms.T6:10-I stand up because I need to pee really badly. Everything is downhill from here. Once, several months ago, I took Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, and ever since then I’ve been afflicted with an occasional pulsing, tingling pain and a numbness on the inside of my thighs and all down my legs. I think I caused permanent vasoconstrictive damage. I feel it again this time, but very intense, probably from sitting in the same position with my legs folded for so long. I walk to the sea to pee in it. As I stumble forward with my throbbing aching legs I get the worst feeling of ominous premonition. I feel déjŕ vu, like I’ve experienced this in a dream, and it was my final moments. The patterns in the sand carved by the waves begin to mirror and swirl and tessellate to infinity. Each step feels like I’m stepping not on sand but on something solid, like wood, and it feels like the blood is hardening inside my body. I have had premonitions and feelings of coming death while tripping before, and each time it is accompanied by a swirling metallic sound, a sort of whining, with swings in pitch, and each step I take, that dizzying noise fills my ears and bounces around the sounds of the waves. This is it. This is my final trip. This is the one that kills me. I have deep vein thrombosis, my blood will clot in my legs and I will collapse into the sea and die. Normally I can keep calm while feelings of death come on, I accept it as a consequence of my actions, and even while I think that, it still triggers a physical panic response in me. As I pee, my friend runs around me, saying all sorts of things, I forget what they were and they were most likely friendly in nature, but I construe them as negative and malicious.T6:20-I still don’t feel like I’ve totally lost control. I go back to where my friends are. The word bad trip is coming in my mind, I can feel the tendrils of ill thoughts, infinite loops, and unstoppable chains of negative ideas seeping into my brain, spreading like a cancer. I can feel the tendrils of ill thoughts, infinite loops, and unstoppable chains of negative ideas seeping into my brain, spreading like a cancer. Have you ever played the game with someone where you keep putting your hands on top of one another, infinitely topping each other? That is what my thoughts were doing, flowing from infinity right into one another, each one building on the last in an infinite untraceable stream, and I would keep having to cut off the chain of thought when the negativity began to creep in, cut if off before it consumed me. This was only sort of effective. We begin to walk back to the house. I need to get back, I need to lie down, I need somewhere warm and calm and safe to gather myself before things get worse. One vivid visual I remember is my friend running towards me. He seemed like he was going absurdly fast, like in an old movie. As he ran, his face multiplied until his entire body was just his face over and over again in the shape of his being. This was then replaced by his hands, until he became a running mess of extremities. As we walk back, I begin to have the racing thoughts of memories I get while on tryptamines. Only unlike other times, where every memory is warm and pleasant, these ones are cold and unwelcoming, I can only think of how uncomfortable I have been, how tedious every moment of existence is, how I will never feel good or comfortable and never have. I can only think about the cold negativity of every moment of my past, the bad drowning out any good. My heart has been racing this entire time.T6:40-We get back inside. I do not recall what happened much, I remember walking around the house. I wasn’t in full suffering mode yet, but was facing a brutal existential crisis. Everything feels so wrong, so uncomfortable, there is so much suffering in the world and everyone feels so much suffering, and there is no way to avoid it. Any potential future I envision is filled with more tediousness, more unfulfilling mediocrity, more pain, more draining crushing depression and debilitating self-loathing. It’s completely inescapable and all I can do is laugh at my total despair. I sit next to a table, it looks alive, it feels alive, I can sense a life force in it. The corner looks like a huge grinning mouth. Normally while tripping I can appreciate the beauty in that, but in this instance my racing negative thoughts are giving me a headache and this living table is just a reminder of what I have done to myself. It only serves to incite even more painful thoughts.T7:00- I sit in a room. A large group of people are having a spirited discussion about something I know a good bit about. I wish I could join but I can barely form words at this point. I feel even worse about this, I feel stupid and useless, I feel like I am condemned to always be stupid I useless. I am the fool, the jester who decided to take too many drugs in the presence of people who were content with weed and alcohol, the dunce who decided to silence himself and stifle his own thoughts in pursuit of hedonism. I sit and listen, barely comprehending the English language, before the discomfort and painful thoughts boil over. All I can think about is suffering. There is so much human suffering. In history people have experienced such incredible pain, physical, mental, emotional, and so often at the hands of the malice of others. And what could they do about it? They certainly weren’t able to stop themselves from feeling that pain, because it happened, because suffering is real and unavoidable, especially when some are purposely trying to inflict it on others. And I certainly wouldn’t be able to stop any suffering that came my way. I was lucky, I was fortunate that nothing terrible ever happened to me, I was lucky that I had never been dismembered or set on fire or beaten or tortured or maimed in a car accident, but it was such a fine line between my current life and that. And I was powerless. Completely and utterly powerless to stop any of that. And I was powerless to stop myself thinking about it, I had unwittingly opened a new paradigm, one where I could understand nothing but suffering, where every moment was experienced relative to the potential suffering I could be experiencing. So many terrible painful things could happen. I remember vividly, someone could run into this house, some madman, find me on the floor, rip off my fingernails, crush my limbs, splinter my bones, splatter my muscles, rip my organs apart, and what the fuck could I do to stop them? I was so vulnerable, I was so weak, I was so powerless, and because of that, incredible suffering felt inevitable, I had a premonition that my life in the future would be suffering I couldn’t even imagine at the current time.T7:30-I run upstairs, I feel sick, I feel like my body is shutting down and I am losing control of my organs. I lock myself in the bathroom. I spend the next half hour sitting on the toilet, wishing this could end. Why did I do this, why did I ever enjoy tripping? I feel as though this trip has opened my eyes to a realm of anguish the likes of which I had never seen before. I would never be able to view the world in a pleasant away again, I had doomed myself to a bleak life of knowing only the yawning and infinite chasm of despair that I had dared to gaze into. I sat on the toilet, shaking violently, wanting to escape this burden of existence somehow, though I knew death would not even be an escape. Literally everything I could think about was crawling with negativity, there was a downside to every possible option that overpowered and destroyed any potential good side. My thoughts were racing and every single one hurt. I begin to imagine every fleeting moment, how exact and precise every occurrence in the world was. Normally, while tripping, I would appreciate the beauty of this, like thinking about a certain thing in a certain situation, how that would happen just once, and never happen again, how every specific instance swirled forth from the chaos. But instead of appreciating each moment, I cried in the tragedy of their fleetingness and their death, and in mourning for the astronomical amounts of moments that would never ever happen ever, for the ones that never did happen, for the ones that weren’t happening, for the ones that happened and never will happen again. The unfulfilled desires that would be impossible to ever fulfill, the missed opportunities and perpetual failures. I heard voices from downstairs having the same spirited discussion, and again and again I hear my name coming from downstairs, they’re talking about me, they know I fucked up, etc etc (I doubt anyone actually said my name once). I suddenly realize, what if someone else wants to use this bathroom? I decide to suffer in my existential crisis out in the hallway. People come upstairs and find me for the first time. Despite me saying I’m okay, they can tell something is wrong, and offer to bring me water. They are nothing but friendly, loving, accommodating. I feel sick, but this calms me down a bit.T8:00- I go back downstairs for some awkward social interaction. My speech and language capabilities are still subpar, and I am having great difficulty explaining how I feel, what I just felt, and making conversation in general. My memory fails me as my thoughts jump and chain around, causing me to lose track of conversations mid-sentence. Visuals are dying down, but the perspective and size of the room still feels totally out of whack.T8:30- More friendly, loving, caring interaction slowly pulls me out of the negative chains of thought. I am no longer meticulously and consciously thinking and wrangling every bit of stimulus and every action. My automatic thought returns and it’s a huge burden off my mind. My thoughts are no longer blossoming into toxic tendrils of negative possibilities and wicked pain and a bleak and hopeless future, they now blossom into warmth and considerations of a pleasant future and good things to come. The storm has passed, the sickness is over.T10:00-I smoke more. Nothing to note, everything has calmed down, people are going to bed, I am still wired from the acid and stay up later. I feel confident, warm, happy, and energetic. I  thoroughly clean the house while everyone is sleeping just to make myself useful and make up for being an incoherent basket case most of the night.T12:00-I lie down to sleep. Visuals are still slightly playing if I pay attention to them-a rippling of everything that looks like the waves of heat rising off a hot surface. I eventually fall asleep.Exp Year: 2014ExpID: 110553Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 18 Published: Mar 23, 2018Views: 14,188    LSD (2), Mushrooms (39) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:  smokedCannabis - High CBD  5 hitsoralLSD(edible / food)BODY WEIGHT:165 lbNOTE: I did not have a tolerance to LSD at the time.It was a typical Saturday afternoon. A week prior, I had made plans with 3 of my friends to trip on some very potent liquid LSD we had picked up recently. I was given a serious warning from my dealer not to consume more than 3 drops. He sincerely claimed that the vial needed to have a warning label on it. His source had driven several hours to another city just to obtain the acid, because it was such a wicked batch. It was supposedly 'barely diluted'. Being my usual skeptical self, I decided I was going to ignore his advice and go balls deep to see what beautiful places my mind could take me to. My friends were very inexperienced with LSD for the most part; 1 friend (who will be called JAM) had tripped a total of 7 or so times, another (D) a single time (actually 2 days before this trip), and the other (KA) was dropping for his first time for his birthday. The day seemed all too perfect for anything to mess up, despite the fact that during this time in my life, I had had a myriad of personal issues and insecurities (that could possibly lead to bad experiences, but I didn't completely take that into account).I'm honestly starting to get slightly uneasy even thinking about the experience I am about to describe.Around 3:30 P.M., my friend (KY, he was sober) picked me up from my house. He was with D and KA, who were minutes away from consuming their acid. We drove to my other friend's house, where my personal stash of acid was sitting in the freezer. The LSD was dropped onto sugar cubes. Our plan was to drive to our friend JAC's house and enjoy the ride in a safe setting, while the people that opted not to trip smoked marijuana. I walked into his house and saw a couple of my friends there. We briefly conversed and smoked a bowl of top-quality CBD-rich Sativa marijuana (an anti-psychotic chemical in marijuana that reduces anxiety) for a few minutes as a 'way to ease me into my trip' (haha, yeah right, I believe this is what made the come-up so overwhelmingly fast). I pulled a whopping five sugar cubes out of the freezer and shoved them in my mouth, then licked a bunch of sugar crumbles off the foil which came from the edges of the 11 sugar cubes I had in my stash. My friends were a bit shocked I was willing to go that far, but they sort of already were used to my tendency to consume large quantities of psychedelic drugs. I talked with them for another 10 minutes or so, then I went back to the car. On my way to the car, I noticed I was starting to feel increasingly disoriented. It wasn't that euphoric, confusing sort of disorientation, it was more of a 'I'm losing fucking my mind' sort of thing. I felt slightly anxious, but I assumed the negative feelings would pass as soon as the acid took full effect. A couple minutes after I got in the car, D ate 2 sugar cubes, and KA ate 1.I suspect this was easily around 1000 micrograms. I have consumed 100+ ug blotter that did not compare at all to this liquid. On a separate occasion, taking two of these was enough for a level 4 experience (hallucinations, ESP, OOBES)The experience was about to get very, very ugly. To give a little perspective on the unfathomable effects of 1000 mic doses, here is a quote from the Nobel Prize winning chemist Kary Mullis that ingested 1000 micrograms for his first dose: 'When you take 1000 micrograms of LSD, you don't know you've taken anything. It just feels like that's the way it is. You might suddenly find yourself sitting on a building in Egypt three thousand years ago, watching boats on the Nile.'Yes, it is THAT FUCKING CRAZY.Ten minutes into the car ride and twenty minutes after eating the sugar cubes, I was rapidly losing all touch with reality. I started wondering what the fuck was going on around me, and why I was feeling so uncomfortable. I started wondering what the fuck was going on around me, and why I was feeling so uncomfortable. I started telling my friends I was really scared, and the intense anxiety was gripping every single fiber of my body. I thought I was going die and that this trip was going to last until the end of eternity. By the minute, I was starting to panic more. This was only the beginning of an unimaginable nightmare that would show me the 'evil' side of LSD and completely change my opinion about the drug in general. 25 minutes after taking the sugar cubes, we arrived at JAC's house. By that time, I was stumbling all over the place and I was already having severe visual distortion. All movements were followed by strobing trails composed of detailed patterns, kaleidoscopes, and rainbows. These visuals that I would have usually considered beautiful were now viewed as a reminder that I was in the middle of a trip that I so desperately wanted to end. When I got inside his house, I saw a few more of my friends sitting on the couch. My body temperature had elevated to the point I thought I was burning alive. I was completely out of my body and almost felt like I was on a high dose of ketamine. I felt embarrassed because I obviously looked like I couldn't handle my shit; maybe this was just an extreme amplification of my general self-esteem issues. Their faces were assuming demonic forms. I fled to JAC's room. I was already starting to experience ego loss. I was going in and out of consciousness.This is the point where I lost track of time, so there is no point of trying to estimate anything....JAC followed me to his room and did his best to comfort me and talk me out of my bad trip. It was a completely ineffective attempt. A couple minutes later, I started crying hysterically. Everything was getting darker. I fell into the most depressive state of my life, combined with the most acute sense of panic I've ever experienced. The floor was covered in spiraling kaleidoscopes that were rapidly shifting colors. I heard thousands of voices call me names like 'pussy' and 'bitch'. The room wreaked of sewage and feces. This was the most negative emotion a human being could ever fathom. I so desperately wanted to kill myself but I was immobilized and unable to move. I realized that the voices were of all of the people I resented in my life the most. Cartoon blood was all over the ceiling and the walls. My vision seemed to stretch off into infinity. I was hallucinating so much I couldn't fucking believe it. I could see many different events of my life playing out as if it was waking reality. Try and imagine being inside of a Saw movie first hand, but a thousand times more horrifying and traumatic. There was a moment in which my mind would shoot out of my body two feet in front of me and then return into my body, and this looped over and over again for what felt like FOREVER at an impossible speed. Time was non-existent, and a second felt like FOREVER. Not hours, not days, but an infinite amount of time. I kept hearing this bizarre futuristic noise that sounded like a computer glitching. The whole room was flashing as if something was flicking the on switch for a lamp up and down repeatedly. My jaw was rapidly vibrating like I had taken 300 mg of MDMA (I always get major jaw clenching from acid). I had full-blown synaethsia. Everything was one, everything was infinitely interconnected. I would look at the walls and become the walls. I would look at the floor and then become the floor, looking back at my body in a dissociative fashion. I was unable to differentiate any part of the outside world from my own physical body. The concept of 'I' was now a mere construct of my mind, and 'I' was nothing more than a complex bundle of atoms and molecules. The floor started to wither away and die. It was as if it had human emotions and was feeling every bit of suffering I was going through at the time. Everything started to turn blood-red. I was going straight to the depths of hell. Matrix numbers were literally exploding out of the ground and shooting up and down the walls. I felt like I was on DMT, only it was a thousand times more intense. Somehow, just a little while after this part of the trip, I regained some degree of consciousness. I stumbled to the backyard, where a group of 8 or so people were sitting and I was watching the sky and everything in my external environment turning black and red. I could barely see anything, my vision was almost completely shot. I forget that I even had a body at this point and I had absolutely no control over my muscular movements. I was in this 'survival mode' where my mind was on autopilot and and I had no idea that I was on drugs. I lost balance and fell backward onto the ground. I continued to see more incredible vortexes of matrix- style numbers and letters spurt out from every direction.During my friends' attempts to help restore me to sanity, they asked if I knew what time it was. I responded with '8:00 A.M.' when it was late in the afternoon. That was quite enough of a response to prove I was completely and utterly going nuts and there was no real way to help me. Once night fell, I was full-on peaking in JAC's room. I began to literally have no idea who I was, where I was, or what drug I was on (or what drugs were in the first place). I knew that I was going to die and nothing could be done to stop it.  At some point at the beginning of the peak, I realized that I could not recognize the room I was in. Suddenly, I started seeing several cop cars pull into the room and put their sirens on. Yellow caution tape magically appeared around them as well. This was one of my worst nightmares coming to life before my very eyes. There was a line of already-arrested criminals in handcuffs next to the cop cars, and they were all complaining that I had snitched on them for some unspecified reason. I knew I was in for absolute hell. Before I could see what was going to happen next, everything started fading to white. I could see nothing but burning white light, like I was looking directly at the sun from 100 feet away. What I saw was.....the ultimate truth. The answer to every question. The reason reality is the way that it is. I existed within the past, present, and future simultaneously. I couldn't see my own hand in front of my face. I dissolved into infinity. I was existing in an infinite number of dimensions, living an infinite number of lives simultaneously for an infinite amount time. Though my memory of this is hazy, I believe I re-lived every event of my entire life during the peak. I could fit our entire universe into a period at the end of a sentence. Time was a point of nothingness. I was everything, yet I was nothing. I was in pure ecstasy. I felt the unconditional love of the universe penetrating every pore of my body. If only this could have lasted forever. I suppose this was a taste of the beautiful part of ego death, but my stay in this ineffable place was cut short when I was suddenly catapulted into hyperspace, where I experienced every ounce of pain any human being could ever possibly experience at one time. The love rapidly shifted to evil in its purest definition. I saw many miserable people I had seen throughout my life, including the homeless and starving. My brain's sensory filter was gone; every last bit of information that could physically be processed at once was flowing through my head at light speed. I was dropped out of hyperspace directly into a hallucinatory prison facility. I saw hundreds of pitbulls, white supremacists, and naked black men running around. It was a state of sheer pandemonium. I have never been so unbelievably horrified in my entire life. I was now sure that this is where I would die. I was taken to the showers where I was bitten repeatedly by pitbulls and raped by the white supremacists and black men simultaneously. I was sobbing hysterically screaming for it stop. It was physical and emotional torture beyond your wildest dreams. I felt every single sensation, including their penises in my anus and the razor-sharp teeth of the vicious dogs. Who knows how long this actually went on for, but eventually this torture ended and I was back in JAC's room. I saw all of my friend's faces covered in knife wounds and deep, bleeding cuts. Puddles of blood were all over the room. My joints were still in severe pain from the physical torture I had just experienced.I looked at the clock, and it read 9:00 P.M. (or something along those lines). Minutes after I came back to earth, I realized that the purpose for human existence was to love. Love is our higher purpose. I now understood that the ego I had developed my entire life was an illusion all along. Our egos push us away from our ability to feel compassion towards others. As your ego fades away, you slowly dissolve into pure unadulterated LOVE. The illusion of separation created by our egos has been the root cause of suffering all across our planet, and sadly this is the reason the majority of the world kills each other for absurd purposes like religion and resources. Religions like Christianity hide behind the idea that there is an afterlife because they are afraid of death. There is nothing to fear, because when you die there is no “you” to fear anything. THE ONLY THING THAT SEPARATES US FROM OTHER FORMS OF LIFE IS OUR ABILITY TO THINK. Our ego is composed of our thoughts. When we stop relying on our ego, we cannot experience negative emotions. When we stop thinking, our ego ceases to exist, and then we can live a life of pure love, peace, and prosperity. The more we rely on our ego, the more we push ourselves away from the moment which is all. Nothing outside the moment we are in right now will ever exist. Yesterday never is, and tomorrow will never be. Time is infinite. The past, present, and future are all occurring simultaneously. We are merely observers. Free will is an illusion. This was by far the most profound experience of my entire life.I quickly forgot all of these things within 15 minutes of the peak ending. I didn't fully understand the lessons I learned for until months had passed after the trip. I quickly forgot all of these things within 15 minutes of the peak ending. I didn't fully understand the lessons I learned for until months had passed after the trip. The next day was easily the worst day of my life (excluding the trip). I felt so self-conscious about myself that suicide was all I could think about. I was thoroughly convinced that I had ruined my life permanently. During ego death, I became aware of the severity of my many mental disorders. I realized that throughout my entire life, I had been looked down upon as the 'special kid'. I had not been aware of this until that moment. I felt like the most inferior form of life on the face of the earth. After I got home I burst into tears. I even thought my family felt sorry for me and had pitied me my whole life because they thought I was a moron. I had a psychotic break for weeks afterward. This was easily the most traumatic thing I have ever gone through in my entire life and has left a lasting mark on me that I carry to this day. It's been over 6 months now and I think about this trip every day of my life. It's nothing any human being ever deserves to go through and I would never wish it on my worst enemy. Over time this trip has had a profound impact on all areas of my life, in both positive and negative ways.Positive: I have very close friends now and rather than the 'special kid', many people now view me as a very insightful and intelligent person. Before this experience, I had very, very few friends. I wasn't close friends with the ones mentioned in this report, but we chilled every once in a while. I now know what true friendship is. I go to parties, I meet new people all the time. I suspect I used to have a mild form of autism and this trip literally eradicated it. My entire family has mentioned multiple times that I'm a transformed person. I have fully developed social skills. I act normally now. I view everyone I meet as a part of my own consciousness. I've earned excellent grades at my community college and have grown tremendously - multiple people have commented that I'm an entirely different person. I've taken up buddhism and adopted a very spiritual lifestyle. Negative: Several months ago, I was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. I suspect I was already pre-disposed to this condition and the trip brought it out. I still have mental flashbacks nearly every day and have been scarred by experience. I frequently have nightmares about this trip. My thoughts can be very scattered and clouded at times. My thinking is very impaired on some days, but it's very sporadic. I've learned how fucked up our world is, and sometimes I feel that ignorance is bliss. Our society disgusts me. I think that the human race is a joke.I am going say one thing: Do not take a high dose of acid unless you have a proper set and setting or it can turn into the worst nightmare of your entire life. 300 micrograms is more than enough to have a spiritual experience. 1000+ micrograms did not provide a near-death experience, it provided a BEYOND-death experience. LSD is a seriously powerful drug and it has the ability to FUCK a person like nothing they could ever conceive of. In fact, after this experience I firmly believe it is the most powerful drug known to the human race.Exp Year: 2012ExpID: 98623Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 18 Published: Apr 2, 2018Views: 26,505    LSD (2) : Health Problems (27), Overdose (29), Depression (15), Post Trip Problems (8), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:2 bowlssmokedCannabis(plant material) 3 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:205 lbI smoked a couple bowls before I headed over to my friend's dorm room at about noon. When I got there, I already knew I was going to drop three tabs of acid. This was extremely stupid given how strong the tabs were and that it was only fourth time on the substance. I remember taking them and my friend taking one.I knew of the spiritual and mind-changing possibilities if LSD but hadn't truly broken into an ego-death experience I was about to have. The real reason I was taking the acid that day was not one someone should be taking a dose of acid like that for. I was taking it to have fun and 'trip balls' for shits and giggles. I don't remember it kicking it in and don't remember being aware of existing in reality until a little after four PM. During this time, all I can reoccur is seeing photon-light particles of all colors, way more colors than exist not on LSD, fanning out in every direction from what I later figured to be the Big Bang. As I was drifting in and out of even being in the present moment of reality, there was this kid in the dorm-room who was sober and thought it would be keen to mess with me, at least I thought.I couldn't recollect anything I knew about anything and everything I knew about real life seemed like it was fake and a far-off concept. I would remember things like my name and where I was, that I was a physical object and existed with everyone else and take those thoughts as grand realizations. A pattern started to arise in my statements, 'But when'? All of time, and I mean infinity, every phenomenon that has happened or will ever happen was happening right then. I then connected the Big Bang I had envisioned earlier that day and thought I was experiencing a separate Universe, an entire Big Bang sequence that I would ride to expansion and come back the next day. As the day wore on and we were hanging out with people, they started noticing I wasn't talking much. This is because I was deep in the halls of introspection and participating socially wasn't really on the docket. By around midnight I was still tripping nutsack.I ordered an Uber home and watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and then 'Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia' until the morning. The issue was that I had dosed almost 24 hours ago. I had work at noon. I was still disoriented and definitely mildly in the trip. Time took forever to go on at work. And paranoia took over. I thought for sure I was permatripping and I was trying to figure out a way to tell my family I needed to be checked into the mental hospital. I held it together on the surface the whole time, but I was extremely confused at work and was seeing things differently, I could smell a distinct smell that I figured was the trip. When I went home, I still couldn't go to sleep. I smoked and that had my thoughts racing even faster. The last I could remember was thinking about how I now had to live with Schizophrenia and how to deal with my psychosis.After over 30 hours tripping I had finally passed out. I woke up once and was still a bit confused. I wasn't tripping when I woke up again but the paranoid thoughts are very consuming. The second time I woke up it was with the sunrise and I knew the trip had worn away. I turned on Pink Floyd's 'Time' and cried with urgency and gratefulness.Exp Year: 2017ExpID: 110817Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 18 Published: Apr 11, 2018Views: 913    LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Hangover / Days After (46), Multi-Day Experience (13), Various (28) DOSE:5 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)   smokedTobacco - Cigarettes    smokedCannabis BODY WEIGHT:120 lbIt was around my 15th birthday if I can recall, give or take a couple weeks, when I had the hardest trip I've ever had. It was the 3rd time I had ever taken acid. The 1st time was either in late 91 or early 92 with a friend of mine that scored it from someone at school or something and we stayed out all night riding our bikes around in a shopping mall district where there were a lot of lights. That was the 1st time I had ever gotten high right there, so I was drawn to acid from the very beginning and back then it was more readily available than nowadays it seems. But anyway, an old neighbor and some of his friends I had met were about to score some acid so I jumped at the opportunity and got some as well. I think I payed $20 for this strip that was equivalent to at least 5 hits of cut blotter, and this was some really good acid too. I was kinda scared to eat them all but I saw someone else eat one just like it so I said screw it and ate the sucker. Ohhhhhhhh man I wish I didn’t have now. I knew that once you drop there isn’t any turning back so I just went with it and rode around with them smoking up. It wasn’t until about  90 minutes or so later that it 1st peeked its evil little head out the door so see what was going on. I was smoking a Camel Wide (at that time they were brand new) and I looked at my cigarette and watched the camel start doing laps around the cigarette while everything in the background (road, cars, houses, etc.) was increasingly starting to get a reddish haze to it. I knew right then that I was in for it. I was supposed to go to school the next day so I went home like a dumbass thinking I could lay back and enjoy it for awhile and then go to sleep. I'm about 2 hours into it now and sitting in my little room with my blacklight on and listening to the radio (classic rock) just thinking. I was new to the area and had just moved there from out of state around a couple of months before and had a lot on my mind at the time. It was suddenly getting difficult to breath and the red haze over everything was starting to get pretty intense. From there all of the minor details are difficult to remember. Maybe 20-30 minutes after that they played Pink Floyd Comfortably Numb and I was starting to get a little jittery thinking that I had done way too much and prayed to god silently that it wouldn’t creep anymore. Not more than 20 seconds after that the radio violently sounded like a tape getting eaten up and was slowing down, similar to putting your hand on a record while it is playing but with a evil intensity about it. I immediately freaked and jumped up screaming at the top of my lungs  like a little girl and right then it was as if time was standing still, the clocks stopped blinking and I felt like I was in a horror movie. The strange thing was I never even got up while all this was happening, I was still sitting on my bed. I then knew I really did it this time and it wasn’t about to get any prettier so I got the hell out of that room and once I walked out into the living room it just completely ended, everything was peaceful as could be like I wasn’t tripping at all hardly. I asked my parent if they heard me yell and they said no while watching TV. From this point on it is all bits and pieces that I can remember. I completely lost 3 hours and I don’t even remember what I did during that time, I think I may have went back to my neighbors house but I don’t remember, even a few days after I did it I didn’t remember. All I remember from the next point on is that its early morning and I'm laying in the living room curled up into a ball on the couch scared to death of my surroundings. All I remember from the next point on is that its early morning and I'm laying in the living room curled up into a ball on the couch scared to death of my surroundings. The TV was on some early morning religious show and I remember I suddenly looked up at the TV and the guy turned into an extremely evil reddish figure pointing at me saying in the worst voice you can ever imagine “its your turn to burn”. It was then that I was so terrified that I ran into my room and actually hid under my covers shivering. I wasn’t safe in there for very long because a few moments later I thought I was being sucked into the bed and at the same time was trapped inside of the covers and couldn’t get out and felt like I was suffocating. After I managed to get myself out of the covers I bolted out of that house quicker than a dog chasing a rabbit and ran down the street in dense early A.M. Fog. Oh man, this was really messed up. I was actually hearing people getting shot everywhere and people screaming off in a distance and it was just pure chaos everywhere. A dog started barking at me and his barks were getting louder and louder and louder and it then turned into a scream. It wasn’t far of a run but it seemed like at least 20 minutes when really it was less than 2 maybe. I eventually made it to the house of someone else that dropped (another neighbor) and he was tripping pretty good too. I was freaking him out telling him that I was about to die and all this. He tried his best to reassure me but it did not work. I wigged him out too bad and he acted like he needed to go to sleep or something so I walked outside and once he shut the door I felt like I'd been cast out to the wolves. I cowered home and sat at the kitchen table and put my head down praying it would go away or at least lighten up and then I started drowning in the table, now that was most disturbing. This has happened to me another time also on acid but not near as frightening or intense. I knew my parents were about to get up and I was supposed to go to school but there was no way in hell I was going to make it in that day, so I walked to my neighbors house and luckily he answered the door and let me in. I felt a little more at ease for next few hours. I remember sitting there on the couch and smoking a bowl with him and someone else and I just layed back and I started tripping so fkn hard hearing some kind of messed up 70’s sounding tune in my head and I whenever I closed my eyes I was seeing all kinds of extremely intense stuff, there wasn’t any blackness like when I usually close my eyes, it was like looking at an alternate reality whenever I closed my eyes. I wasn’t about to come down and I thought that I had seriously screwed myself up and played it off with them like I was going to go home and lay down. I went home and I knew that I needed to go to the hospital because I was mentally melting down. I calmly told my mom that I took something and that I was fkn losing it but I lied about the who, where, and why. My dad came home and they both and my sister took me to the emergency room. The radio was off in the car but I was hearing music and I remember telling my dad to turn the channel when he pointed out that it wasn’t even on I started flipping. They got me to the hospital and the doctor quickly put me on a bed and strapped me down for some reason, that was very unpleasant. I remember my dad looked scared to death that I was gonna die. The doctor gave me a couple of pills to swallow and not more than 20 minutes later I was dead tired. I finally went to sleep not long after that and slept for around 2 days. To this day I am positive that I never fully recovered from that particular trip. I realized this when I dropped a  hit last night. I haven’t done acid in a few years and I forgot how it felt, even though I have probably done half a sheets worth in my lifetime. Not to sound like a public service announcement but a word to the wise, I took too much at once, and I fkn regretted it.  It was like jumping off the deep end without a lifeguard and once I dove there wasn't any turning back.Exp Year: 1992ExpID: 46828Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 15 Published: Apr 19, 2018Views: 807    LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Overdose (29), Post Trip Problems (8), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:001 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 7:301 hitsmokedCannabis BODY WEIGHT:64 kgLately I've been experiencing with drugs a little. In the last months I did cannabis, MDMA and mushrooms. The most fascinating drug of them all however, was LSD. Before taking LSD this day, I have taken LSD twice, all by myself. These were very pleasurable and insight-giving experiences, so I was not afraid taking it once again, also by myself. But I really didn't know what I was in for this time.Instead of using the weaker blotters I had used in my previous trips (about 80 µg), I managed to get my hands on stronger ones of +/- 120 µg. But I was sure I could handle these stronger blotters. So I took one, put on some music and waited for the trip to begin.At first things started out really good. The trip was gradually building to its peak at which I was having some great insights, wondering about the definition of time and feeling like I was the king of an alien race invading earth, to make humanity better and blessing them with the gift of psytrance (which I was listening to at that moment). During the first hours of my trip, I drank a lot of water, eventually leading to a full bladder. So at + 3:30, I went to the toilet. That was when things started to get really nasty.When I was at the toilet, with no music surrounding me, I picked up a conversation between my neighbor and a friend he had over. At one moment one of them said the word cancer (which is sometimes used as a curse word in my country). This was the turning point for me, since I watched my grandpa suffer and dying from cancer a few years ago. Since then I hated it when people used the word cancer as a curse word. All of a sudden I became very afraid and had the idea that when I would flush the toilet, I would get sucked into it. I don't know why, but I flushed it anyway. I held on to the doorknob and got out of the toilet as fast as I could, running back into my room as fast as I could.Back inside my room I tried to turn my trip back around into a good trip. This was not working, so I took some vitamin C and decided to eat a tangerine because I believed it would stop the trip earlier. But while peeling the tangerine, I became even more afraid, believing that if I wouldn't eat it, I'd die. It all happened in a flash, and after eating the tangerine it felt as if I had gone into a coma.At this moment, it was as if an alternate me was watching this happening. He was frightened to see me almost dying, but he somehow got me into my bed and told me this was the safest place I could be right now and telling me it would all be over in a few hours. In my 'coma', I saw my parents and sister standing around the bed. They were all very sad and this really scared the hell out of me.I 'woke up' after what seemed to be an eternity, even though only a few minutes had passed in reality. I felt like I was in a hospital fighting to stay alive, surrounded by a lot of horrendous visuals which I was afraid I'd never lose even though I told myself I would. During my 'hospitalization', it was where I really learned to know LSD, contemplating life. But one thing really stuck during these hours: I would never take LSD again. It was at + 6:30 when the LSD had worn off enough to do other things, even though the tormenting visuals were still all over the place. I ordered a pizza and ate it, but I did not enjoy it. In a desperate attempt to get me 'back to earth' again, I decided to smoke some pot at + 7:30. It helped for a second, but the high of the weed had soon disappeared into the still present LSD trip and got me only more paranoid.At + 8:00, I decided to take a shower. In the shower I continued to trip really bad, and it even got me into a short-lived acute psychosis. I had the feeling that nothing made sense and not knowing whether things were real or not. I then put myself to bed, all I wanted was to sleep. But the visions continued to haunt me for four more hours, after which I finally fell asleep.Looking back at the trip, I really underestimated the power of LSD. In the past it had helped me to build more self-esteem and I was convinced a bad trip would not happen to me. I couldn't have been more wrong. The next day, I threw all my remaining acid in the toilet and swore to never use it again. This experience has erased all the fun and benefits from LSD for me. From now on, I will deal with my problems in real life and not while under the influence of psychedelics.Exp Year: 2014ExpID: 103417Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 20 Published: Apr 19, 2018Views: 1,906    LSD (2) : Alone (16), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:  repeated LSDBODY WEIGHT:120 lbI used to do acid whenever I could get my hands on it in high school.  (Generally every weekend).  I loved it and always had a great time for about the first 2 years of doing it.  I never really had strong visuals, but would come to meaningful conclusions about the world and have powerful realizations.  I also enjoyed laughing my ass off at the insanity of the human race.  After a while something changed though.  I began to have bad trip after bad trip.  I would get paranoid and had trouble trusting the people I was with.  I thought that they were laughing at me and staring at me, wondering what was wrong with me.  I also developed anxiety problems.  I'm not sure what changed but I can no longer handle acid anymore and I'm kind of sad about that, but well, there's always mushrooms.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 20389Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Apr 19, 2018Views: 1,769    LSD (2) : Not Applicable (38), Addiction & Habituation (10), Bad Trips (6), Retrospective / Summary (11), General (1) DOSE: T+ 0:002 hitsoralLSD  T+ 0:401 hitoralLSD  T+ 4:301 hitsmokedMethamphetamineBODY WEIGHT:150 lbThis trip does not consist of crazy visuals like monsters or whatnot. It is an example of just how real and frightening an acid trip can become. I was 18 and had gotten ahold of 10 tabs for pretty cheap but trust me when I knew they were good quality (the dealer had a very good rep already, known for giving good deals). I had done acid once, months before, I took  1.5 tabs and felt virtually nothing. I’m pretty sure anything I even thought I felt or saw was placebo. I knew I got ripped off so I was looking forward to trying these new tabs. I originally planned on doing one  tab by myself on a Friday night in my room. But on Thursday my friend (16 years old) ended up staying the night and I suggested we do some together. We decided we would each take 2 tabs. Once we were ready, at 8pm we dropped our tabs. For some reason however 40 minutes later, we thought it would be a wonderful idea to drop one more. Don’t ask me why—terrible decision. At around 9:15 or so walls started slightly moving but I was really enjoying it. Slowly, colors became more vibrant and then by 10pm I was completely color tripping, and EVERYTHING was hilarious. Complete sensory overload, visually and auditory as well, but it was enjoyable. We were dancing and laughing and having a really good time. I looked in the mirror and I could literally watch my face age. Like I watched it grow wrinkles and change shape, it was crazy to watch and I was a little grossed out seeing my old self but I wasn’t scared at all, I thought it was cool. This is where Time starts to get a little blurry. It was super hard to keep track of—sometimes 2 minutes would go by and it would feel like an hour, other times an hour would go by in what seemed like a minute. This is when my psychotic stage started to begin.My friend and I started questioning everything from the government to social media to conspiracies. We were convinced we had been coming up with revelations and had to tell the rest of the world. We were convinced we had been coming up with revelations and had to tell the rest of the world. I wrote down notes warning my sober self of the government and FaceTimed my friends trying to explain that I was telling the truth. Over time, I started to doubt everything, including reality. I had a constant feeling of forgetting what I was just about to say or do. It felt like I was repeating myself, like time was moving backwards then forwards then backwards again. For example, at one point I picked up a lighter to play with then when I set it back down it felt like I was going backwards in time—rather than simply setting it down in the future, if that makes sense. At what I guess was around 11 or 12pm I convinced myself I was in a game and that I was in control of everything, and that nothing I said or did would have an actual effect in real life once I was sober. My friend was FaceTiming a guy and I was sure he was just “part of the game” and that I could say whatever I wanted to him. Looking back I was pretty rude but I thought it didn’t matter because nothing was actually real to me. I also ended up texting and calling my ex boyfriend of one YEAR. Embarrassing, right? I thought it would be funny to talk to him since in my mind I wasn’t REALLY talking to him. Even when he answered the phone and I abruptly hung up, I was still convinced it wasn’t actually him that answered and that it was still part of the game. I also started thinking about what it would be like waking up the next day and realized I literally couldn’t remember what being sober felt like. Like, I couldn’t comprehend what the word sober WAS. I felt trapped in this new state of mind. At some point probably around 12:30 my friend remembered that I owned a meth pipe and suggested we dry hit the remains of the last time I used it. Don’t ask why we thought that was a good idea but yeah, I literally took hits off old brown solidified meth. I’m not sure if that’s what led to the paranoia that eventually set in. I was scared and had overwhelming anxiety. At this point it was around 1:30am and I was super tired and wanted to sleep. But I couldn’t for the life of me. You know that feeling when you’re really tired in bed but just can’t find the right position to fall asleep? That was me, except every time I laid there for more than 5 minutes I was convinced I had to go do some task in order to fall asleep. It started out with normal ish things like taking off my pajama pants because I was burning hot. (WARNING: gross and explicit content ahead) But when that didn’t work I, and don’t ask why, I decided I should take my tampon out. I bled all over my bed but didn’t seem to care. I was sure the blood was part of my imagination and that I could simply wish it away. I continued to take all my clothes off and became really horny. I’m straight but I thought it would be a great idea to call for my friend in the other room to come in. I don’t know what I was hoping for but thank god she was too tired to, otherwise that would have resulted in a really awkward next day. I pursued to masturbate all the while blood was getting everywhere but I didn’t care at all. I became really frustrated though because I tried to “command” the mess to disappear but of course it didn’t. I remembered that I had a Xanax bar in my room but couldn’t find it no matter how hard I tried. I was convinced it simply disappeared on its own and became extremely frustrated and even more anxious because I couldn’t even find medicine to calm me down. So I went to take a shower. I felt good and clean after that and got in bed with my friend because that room was cooler. I thought I finally could fall asleep but I suddenly became burning hot again and couldn’t find a comfortable position. So I thought I would just watch recipe videos on my phone. But literally nothing the chefs were saying made sense to me. It was as if they were uttering complete gibberish. Like the words sounded insane to me. I thought that the internet world had gone crazy and that I was the only sane person left. I turned to my friend and asked her if she was experiencing the same things as me, but she was so tired and out of it all she could reply was “mhmm” or “yeah”. I began to think she wasn’t real either and that she had become a part of the trip. In a panic, I googled things such as “how to stop a bad trip.” The main thing that came up told me to remember that it isn’t real, but I was so delusional that I thought the government had put that online to make me think the trip would end when it really wasn’t going to. I was so excruciatingly frustrated about not being able to sleep that I began to contemplate calling 911 or calling my parents (both of which would have resulted in my life being absolutely ruined, given my parents are adamant on their stance on drugs since I had been caught abusing in the past). My friend told me it wouldn’t be a good idea and that everything would be fine in the morning. For some reason I was convinced that the trip would never end though. I thought that taking acid had put me into this permanent state of delusion. I started to contemplate suicide as the only way out. Like that was literally reasonable to me. Eventually around what I assume was 4am I fell asleep. I don’t remember falling asleep but when I woke up (past my alarm and missing school) I was so shocked to see that I had survived, that the trip ended. I sat in bed in awe that there was blood all over my bed and that it was actually real. In the end I wrote this to show just how frightening an acid trip (especially taking such a large dose for my first time) can become. I hope I was able to get my point across about the level of fear and paranoia I experienced. Afterwards, the comedown was just terrible. I was extremely depressed and anxious and had my first ever panic attack. I almost considered checking myself into a hospital so someone could calm me down but thankfully a different friend was able to meet me and talk me through things. This trip scarred me, so I’m not sure if I’ll ever try acid again. It was the first drug I ever tried that I couldn’t act sober on and where I couldn’t differentiate tripping from reality. I thought I could handle any drug, but acid is a different beast.Exp Year: 2018ExpID: 111870Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 18 Published: May 7, 2018Views: 850    LSD (2) : Hangover / Days After (46), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:1200 ugoral1P-LSDBODY WEIGHT:240 lb[Erowid Note: Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be done casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements were derived, it is reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.] After a long day at work, I drove over to a friend's apartment where two of my friends lived. My best friend was the only other person at the apartment with us. I brought with me 1500 micrograms of LSD and gave my friends 100 micrograms each leaving me with 1200. I also had about a half ounce of cannabis that we smoked a decent amount of during the come up. I noticed I had tracers only 10-15 minutes after dosing which was very unusual. It typically was 45 minutes to an hour before I had anything that noticeable. I really don't remember much after noticing that until some time later. I don't know why I had this gap of memory during the comeup.Within what I'm told was no more than an hour I no longer could remember what was happening or what drug I had taken. My best friend ceased to exist and soon so did I. I devolved into a black screen with green lines of text relaying the conversation I was having, making my thoughts, my voice, and my friend's voice indistinguishable. We were 2 bodies controlled by 1 consciousness. In such a state of confusion, I no longer was enjoying myself. I began grasping my chest and gasping for air, and feeling intense pain throughout my body, particularly my arms. Briefly flashing back into this reality, I began asking what I had taken and how much and was certain despite knowing that you cannot die from LSD that I had taken too much and was going to die. I imagine a lot of this came from not dealing with the emotions of overdosing on fentanyl shortly before this trip (maybe a week to a month prior, that's a blurry time from my life to try and remember). I begged to be taken to a hospital. At this point my friend and I had been getting too loud in our two other friends' apartment so we were sitting in my car in the parking lot. My friend started looking for my car keys to take me to the hospital and ended up leaving me in the car to go in the apartment to retrieve them. He came back out to the car asking me where my keys were (he says he was gone for less than a minute, but to me I was alone in the car for an endless amount of time. It's hard to put a time frame on how long it seemed like as time basically lost meaning by this point) while our other friend followed behind and began yelling to 'get him out of here! He's obvious I don't want to get arrested over him!' I perceived her to have a knife and want to kill me so I took off running, arms flailing in the air, screeching at the top of my lungs 'help! Help! Somebody! I think I'm going to die!' My friend had warrants at the time and did not chase after me, fearing that my screaming in an apartment complex in the early hours of the morning would bring police to the situation. I kept running then would collapse on the street or on the grass and at one point on a bush, flashing to scenic trips in a completely different reality. I kept dying over and over in different horrible ways. Running and stumbling alone I realized I had a phone in my pocket. I couldn't remember my phone password so I swiped to open the 'emergency call' screen. I dialed 911. '911 what's your emergency?''I'm going to die!''Okay, what's going on?''I don't know!''Okay, why do you think you're dying?''I'm on drugs I think I took too much''Okay what did you take?''I don't know!''Okay, can you tell me where you are?''I don't know!''Okay what do you see?''Uhh there's a lot of cars''Are you in a parking lot?''No there's tall buildings all around me''Are you in an apartment complex?'I look around in a state of panic and try to hang up the phone. It's locked up in emergency mode so I can't hang up. I get the 'they know where I am' paranoid feeling, look around and yell 'oh shit!' Throw my phone as hard as I can on the concrete and watch it shatter. I ran away as fast as I could yelling things like 'fuck you!' I have no idea how long this ordeal lasted since time had no meaning to me any more, but soon enough a police car pulled in to the complex and probably didn't have much trouble finding me since I was yelling at the top of my lungs. I was ecstatic that a figure of authority had arrived and ran out in the street waving my arms yelling at the police car 'I'm here, I'm here, thank God you're here!' The two officers stepped out of the car and asked what was going on. I made absolutely no sense and was probably pretty obviously in a psychedelic trip if they knew how to recognize that. I was flashing in and out of this reality into scenic trips again, many of which portrayed the officers as wanting to hurt me and/ or violate me despite the fact that they actually did a pretty good job of not being threatening to me. I was flashing in and out of this reality into scenic trips again, many of which portrayed the officers as wanting to hurt me and/ or violate me despite the fact that they actually did a pretty good job of not being threatening to me. In fact I remember asking at one point when I had no clue what was happening and no memory from anything before that moment 'am I a threat to anyone? Have I hurt anyone? I'm so scared I don't want to hurt anybody'. He was saying things like 'I don't know, but help is coming okay?'. I asked for today's date and when he told me I realized that no longer had any meaning to me other than knowing that it was a date. I asked him how old I was and he told me 'I don't know, you're asking me.' 'Well how old do I look?''I don't know' 'Can I look in the side mirror on your car to see what I look like?''Please don't get close to my car'A lot of this nonsense went on but eventually I would flash into another scenic trip with some perceived threat and run away. I kept running from them and then giving myself back up out of desperation for help. Eventually an ambulance got there and a paramedic approached me. I leaned back and lunged my whole body into the hardest punch I could throw, right into the side of his head. He swung backwards and hit the side of the ambulance. I took off running as fast as I could and one of the officers yelled 'Oh hell no' and this time they all chased me. I pulled my shirt off and realized I was pissing myself, so I dropped my pants as well. I was then tackled on the street butt naked. I fought back as hard as I could but eventually I was knocked out. I never really fell asleep per se but I lost speech and motor skills. I flew out of my body and into the worst hell I couldn't have imagined 30 seconds prior to being there. There was an incredible sense of loneliness and intense pain there. I was in a small, dark area with a burning ball before me. I intuitively understood that the ball was the 'core of my being' and was burning out. The goal in this place was to be able to die so I could stop suffering, but in order to do so I had to watch each piece of myself be torn away and float off into the darkness. All of my memories, my desires, my goals, I watched it all be thrown away as the ball burned smaller and smaller until it finally burned out. From there, most of what I experienced was sensory overload that I couldn't make sense of. All of my senses were taking in way too much data to form anything that I could put into text. I assigned myself a name to feel better about not knowing who I was, so I called myself Bob. Bob was a horrible idiotic drug addict (I wasn't too far off from my real self in that guess) who didn't care enough to not push his own limits. I felt like a shell of a person that simply wanted drugs to feel whole. It was the most lonely feeling I've ever experienced. I didn't know what I looked like but I had a picture of my parents in my head and thought about how disappointed they must be in Bob. I came to in the hospital the next morning and couldn't remember what had happened or how I'd gotten there. It took 3 months to remember. I quit all drugs for that 3 months and ended up taking a few hits off someone's joint at a concert. When I took my seat after the intermission was over the memory all came back to me, and I shook physically out of terror until I went to bed that night. I have not been the same person since I had that trip and in a lot of was it's for the better, but I have to live with the memory every day. There hasn't been an hour that goes by since that day that I'm not thinking about it, trying to process it and understand it. I developed HPPD and have had hallucinations persisting for just shy of a year now. Psychedelics are valuable tools when used properly, just remember it is possible to hurt yourself with a hammer.Exp Year: 2017ExpID: 111865Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 18 Published: May 8, 2018Views: 1,613    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), HPPD / Lasting Visuals (40), Post Trip Problems (8), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Bad Trips (6) DOSE:  oralIbogaine    smokedMushrooms(dried) 3 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:12 stWell, I am not sure where to start, so I'll start with my childhood days of experimenting with substances at wild late night parties. It was during one such occasion a friend introduced me to LSD and gave me a tab, which we both agreed we would wait to take together. He called me later that night and said he had already taken his as he couldn't go out so he'd decided to take his on his own at home, then he prompted me to take mine and said 'may as well as it will just go off if you leave it sitting in the cupboard!'So not sure of what to expect I decided to do so and soon after he called me just when I started to experience its effects to inform me he hadn't actually taken his, he just wanted me to find out what it was like (nice friend, with friends like that who needs enemies?). Anyway it was a wonderful experience, I sat in my room staring at the walls for most of the night as they where shimmering and moving and I had an uncontrollable urge to giggle at nothing in particular, this was followed by tracers and a lot of visuals.Anyway it wore off after a full 12 hours and I pretty returned to normality. Carried on with my normal everyday life, I would have to say I found the experience to be both enlightening and very stimulating.Anyway, years later, after being to more than one such party in my youth and having tried a variety of substances, I decided whilst living away down in the countryside to go out on a mushroom hunt for some Psilocybin. I found a huge field with loads of cows grazing and found a few mushrooms growing right out of a cow pat!These I took home, washed and dried, then a friend I had met and gotten to know told me he had managed to get hold of some Acid and some Ibogaine paste, he asked me if I wanted any to which I replied that I would indeed like to get hold of some of each. A few days later and I was in possession of all three, Ibogaine, LSD and Shrooms.This is where it started to get very funky, I first took a few wraps of the Ibogaine paste wrapped in a cigarette paper, then I followed that up with some dried and crushed shrooms in a bowl and then followed that up with 3 tabs of Acid!The experience itself was terrifying, I saw bright rainbow colors to begin with, followed by a huge urge to sleep (on LSD hard to believe but true!), I fell asleep at around 6:30 in the afternoon thinking my heart was going to explode out of my chest with my thoughts becoming very incoherent to awake sharply at around 10:30 at night. What I saw was something like vine leaves crawling from the walls of the place I was staying, followed by the sight of lights in the sky. I saw something that looked like a huge hooded figure of a man wrestling with a tree outside my bedroom window, this was followed up by a shimmering kind of plant invading the bedroom I was living in which then proceeded to shimmer up and down my arms and YES I could feel this happening as though it was actually real and not a hallucination! I remained awake for most of the night, next day I saw something like a giant worm slithering past the window, whilst smoking another bowl of shrooms. I hadn't slept in almost two days and my mind was bordering on severe psychosis. I eventually abandoned my habitat and returned home to my mother's across 50 miles of land to get there, whilst gibbering about aliens from another world. In the end I even started to hear voices and had to physically force myself to go to sleep and ignore the visuals and the voices in my head which kept re-appearing in the dark, when I turned out the lights!When I awoke I was convinced it was some kind of huge cosmic joke and that the whole universe was in on it having a huge laugh at my expense. It took two days of sleep to recover from the experience and for me to come to my senses and realize it had all been a very bad trip brought on by taking all three substances at the same time.I will never do something so stupid ever again, but I will certainly have a much wider view on substance abuse because of the experience itselfExp Year: 2007ExpID: 69608Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: May 17, 2018Views: 4,905    LSD (2), Ibogaine (28), Mushrooms (39) : Combinations (3), Entities / Beings (37), Bad Trips (6), Alone (16) DOSE: T+ 0:00  repeatedsmokedCannabis   T+ 0:001.66 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:45138 mgoralMDMA(powder / crystals)BODY WEIGHT:165 lbI got MDMA a few weeks ago from a good friend of mine and had been wanting to try this chemical for quite some time. I was extremely excited to try it and was waiting for the right time. However I did not choose the right time. What followed was possibly the worst trip of my life.Before dosing:Before I dosed I went over to my friend that I mentioned before to smoke, while I was there I did two dabs, ate a 100mg edible, took a bunch of bong rips and smoked a few joints with her. I was considering just dropping acid that night, but I was in a great mood and wanted to Candyflip. So when I got home I weighed out my dose of MDMA (138mg) and dropped a tab and two-thirds (150ug blotters) and waited patiently for a short while before I dosed my MDMA.I was having the time of my life on the acid, the acid alone was a lovely trip, all the cannabis from earlier really helped with the come-up and made the trip have a little more of a push in the right direction it felt. From the start I felt like this would be a top five experience for sure.Forty-five minutes after I dosed the L, I dropped my dose of MDMA and awaited the onset. At first I felt like I was floating and was very smiley and giddy. I was loving it, then I suddenly rocketed into space and it suddenly became too much, all I can think was 'oh shit I took too much, this isn't fun anymore' but there would be brief moments where it felt like the best thing in the world and right back to fear.One song by sevenlions had me feel like I would rise to the top of a skyscraper and then drop hard with the bass and it was just too much for me to take in. I freaked. I hopped to the next song by him and it made me feel alone and afraid, all I wanted at that moment was someone physically there with me all I wanted at that moment was someone physically there with me, to hold me and tell me it'd be okay. I had never felt so alone at that point.I changed the song and started to play some Grateful Dead, which at that point I calmed down for a bit and started to think. I think shooting into space sort of chilled out, however when I started thinking I started hurting. Within a few minutes I was texting my friend, thinking he was my mom and telling him how much I love her, telling him my decisions behind choices.The next thing I know, I think I'm having a seizure and I throw up. I rush outside and run down the street in my boxers after a car screaming to help me, ran back inside and called 911 and said I was having a seizure. In reality I never did. The cops come and I think I'm somehow in a coma and the cops are really my mom and dad, I tell them what I took, ambulance comes and takes me to the hospital. The entire ambulance ride was 'how much longer until we're at the hospital' every two seconds.I get to the hospital and keep asking when to see the doctors, then curse out the nurses and flip them off. The doctor asks if I've had seizures in the past, told him about the one on shrooms and he was puzzled by that (as was I and everyone else I know, especially because I had eaten them a few times before I had a seizure on them) and he gets me an IV put in.What I found out the next day when I got home:I pissed on a nurse, cursed the nurses out multiple times, and my nurse stayed in my room with me for hours making sure I was fine. Apparently the nurse that had been there the entire time was the only one that could calm me down. When I saw the sheet of medication that was given to me the next day I really don't know why they gave me what they gave me:100mg Ketamine IV, 100mg DPH IV, 2mg Lorazepam IV, 2mg Midazolam IV.I really just can't understand the Ket honestly.But overall it was too much. I'm still trying to figure out what could have happened that caused me to think I had a seizure. I'd love to try MDMA another time, but honestly I may just pass out of fear.Exp Year: 2015ExpID: 107011Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 19 Published: May 23, 2018Views: 1,802    LSD (2), MDMA (3) : First Times (2), Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Alone (16) DOSE: T+ 0:00.5 tabletsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:30.5 tabletsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 1:00.5 tabletsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:8 stSO last night I decided to take acid for only the second time in my life. The first time I was 18 and I hated it but I have read a lot about the therapeutic benefits of LSD and thought it would help me to heal. I was on my own in the flat and put some calming music on.I took half a tab at 3pm, and then didnt feel anything so took another half, half hour later, and then again another half, half hour after that. By 5pm I was wasted, I couldnt see properly or stand up, I ended up falling into my bed and just closing my eyes, I cant remember anything that happened, only my mind was racing so fast, I couldnt sleep, I was tossing and turning, so hot and sweaty and uncomfortable, and then finally at 4am I started to feel a little normal again. I was meant to go to work this morning but I was a right mess after no sleep. I'm feeling ok now, 24 hours post drug injestion, but I was just wondering what other peoples experience was. Did I take too much, was the environment not good? I must say I never want to take it again!

I just recently had discovered MDMA, and it had been a great experience. Now I wanted to go a step further.My girlfriend and I had spent the afternoon with my family on a family meetup and left in the evening to join our partners in crime. We met in the house of a childhood friend of mine, in the outskirts of a big city. We were: My girlfriend and I, my childhood friend and three further couples. One of them would not take anything and watch over our trip, as well as watch over a baby sleeping in the same building, using a laptop and Skype.I didn't feel very comfortable in my friend's living room as it was full of things and lighted really brightly. I had read that messy surroundings could be really overwhelming when tripping. The lights were turned off and replaced by candles, which improved things a lot.I told Vee, our experienced trip instructor, that I'd be up for 2 hits, and that I didn't want to combine the trip with MDMA, as I wanted to experience the real thing. Both tips that I had read online. Vee told me that was a bad idea and gave me only one. She also said it would take maybe an hour and a half for me as a first-timer to notice any effects, longer than for the others. I was sure that I wasn't going to have a bad trip as I am an emotionally stable person. Also my girlfriend had some LSD experience already, all only positive. My girlfriend was the first to feel it, about 20 minutes in. Vee said that wasn't possible, it would take longer. Shortly afterwards she felt it, too, and so did I. Things started really nicely, my perception changed. Patterns started to move, things seemed to breath. It was fun to watch myself in the mirror. I saw my girlfriend morphing into herself at the age of 17 (as I knew her from pictures) and then even younger, at around age 13. Incredible. The birds on my t-shirt were dancing.My girlfriend and I moved upstairs, into a dark and empty room with a balcony overlooking the garden, where the others had lit a campfire. Everything was weird, new and exciting. My perception was tilted in unexpected ways. Everything was weird, new and exciting. My perception was tilted in unexpected ways. I was able to *see* the smell from the fire on the balcony and the smell of the wooden floor inside. I could *touch* that smell. The blinking light from a charger seemed to talk to us. I had read about focus problems during the peak of the trip and focus problems I had. I couldn't keep a thought for longer than a second. So this was the peak of the trip, I assumed.Our tripsitter visited us to ask if everything was ok. My girlfriend told him she wanted to take MDMA. He said, he would 'pass on her request'. I imagined what impression we must give to a sober person and told her I was sure we were not being taken seriously. We walked into the bathroom and found a universe of its own. Everything was moving and had strange forms. The floor seemed to be wet and dry at the same time. Really weird.  Then we went downstairs again. The atmosphere had changed. The living room was dark and in it sat a group of completely black figures, laughing a little when we arrived. We went into the garden and sat down at the fire.I was increasingly confused and tried to make sense of the state I was in, and trying to find out if the others were in the same state. What they said didn't make much sense to me. They laughed and discussed the option of taking another hit. That confused me even more, as I was feeling mine very strongly. I looked around and noticed we were sitting close to the fence. I imagined what some neighbors or passers-by would think if they could hear our drug talk. They could certainly hear that. The others just laughed at my thought. What if they called the police? A car passed. I thought I saw somebody hiding behind the fence.What freaked me out was that the others started using the exact same sentences over and over again. Maybe somebody was pulling my leg here. I felt bad and touched my girlfriend's leg, as I assumed she must feel bad, too. She didn't seem to. I went inside again. The figures sitting on the sofa looked scary, with big, black eyes. I went to the toilet. There things started to get crazy. The room was turning upside down, the dead fly on the floor was the size of a rat, tiles started to move towards me and back. I tried to figure out what had happened. This clearly had nothing to do with anything I had read online about LSD trips. I remembered stories of people enjoying the beauty of nature, stories of sex on LSD. This was something entirely different. Suddenly a strong diarrhea kicked in. I heard laughter outside while I shat. Back in the living room everything had somehow changed. The house and the room had stopped existing, it was more like a black hole. What people said made no sense to me. Their eyes were huge, covering half of their faces. One face consisted just of eyes and teeth, and grinned demonically at me. Some phrases were used again and again. My childhood friend came inside and looked like a frog. He laughed loudly, opened his mouth and issued a gigantic burp. People were talking about MDMA. My girlfriend looked scary, like a maniac drug addict with huge eyes. I tried not to look into anybody's face anymore. I was scared to death. I tried not to look into anybody's face anymore. I was scared to death. Something clearly was going wrong here. Our tripsitter said incredibly strange things and stuck some herbs under my nose. Two big eyes in his face were staring at me at close distance, one some centimeters higher in his face than the other. He was clearly on drugs, too. The laptop with the Skype babyphone made a noise. Somebody made a joke about it. The laptop became the center of my universe, with everything around collapsing. How can somebody be so irresponsible? We were on a gigantic drug party, having taken God knows what, with a baby in the middle! Everything was going downhill from now on. My thoughts centered around the baby my girlfriend and I were planning to have and my parents who I had seen just some hours ago. Now everything seemed to end in a drug hell with no escape. I was terrified. 'Irresponsible!' - the word popped into my head a dozen times. I considered how I could save everybody from this collapsing world. How I could save my girlfriend.People around me were laughing. I went to the toilet again. I shat and then suddenly threw up. Everything I had eaten and drunk landed in the toilet in front of me. Then I fled to the garden. I felt the wet grass under my feet and looked at the trees. I remembered trip stories praising nature on LSD and understood. Nature gave me some comfort. The voices around me terrified me. The same sentences again and again. Some evil things to my ears. Sometimes somebody would come and hug me. I enjoyed the touch but avoided to look into their devilish faces. Every word they said was wrong. A woman came and touched me and said in an ice-cold voice: 'I don't care about you at all, you're nothing.'I started to think that maybe I was hallucinating, that all the mean things they said came out of my head. I tried to ignore the voices but I couldn't. I noticed that my girlfriend was hugging me. I don't know for how long already. I felt the cold, wet grass and laid down. Many hands were on my back, this felt good. I started to vomit again, into the grass. My stomach emptied and I continued to vomit air and spit. I stood up and noticed that the garden door was open. This terrified me even more. The fence looked smaller than before, the outside world dark and scary.I fled inside, on the sofa. There I tried to think what to do to prevent the worst. I decided that not doing anything and not going anywhere was the only way. I laid down and looked outside of the window, to the sky. I stayed like that for hours, trying to ignore the evil voices and faces around me. My girlfriend's hands on my body gave me some comfort but I was scared like never before in my life. She stayed with me for hours. Somebody suggested to go for a walk. This sounded like a big menace to me.After sunrise Gor's and Vee's voices around me suddenly changed in tone, sounded human again. I said 'Maybe this was really you who said that'. 'That was me' said Gor and I believed him. The horror trip seemed to have ended, the voices were not coming out of my head anymore. The faces still looked scary, with huge eyes, but things had improved. I slowly realized that my universe had not ended but I had simply had a bad trip. And the trip was ending.My girlfriend - who thanks to me had had a hard night, too - and I took a taxi home. The picture on the taxi driver's ID moved and grinned at me, and at home all things looked really different. My girlfriend still had big eyes. Only after some hours of sleep everything looked normal again, and the terror in my bones had left me. I am still trying to figure out what went wrong and what this night tells me about me, my urge to control things, my judgemental side and my thing with 'responsibility'.Exp Year: 2014ExpID: 103867Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 39 Published: May 28, 2018Views: 2,571    LSD (2) : First Times (2), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:  repeatedinsufflatedCocaine(powder / crystals) 300 mgoralCocaine(powder / crystals) 3.5 goralCannabis(plant material)   oralKetamine    oralLSD    oralAmphetamines BODY WEIGHT:150 lbI'm someone who will take pretty much any drug or combination thereof. I don't buy into the kind of propaganda that follows the lines of 'substance X will ruin your life in this specific way regardless of anything else.' Some drugs are worse than others, sure, but I've done the 'big three' - heroin, crack, meth - and although I've gotten into some terrible situations I've never become a stereotypical down and out addict staggering around with a can of special brew and asking strangers for 28p for the bus at all hours of the day. Nor do I entirely buy into the idea that drugs can act as a catalyst to mental illness. These things certainly happen, but they aren't set in stone.What I have had are some awful acute experiences. Blowing nearly Ł700 on cocaine in a couple of weeks. Necking handfuls of xanax and coming to a few days later with no recollection of the interim. These things are horrible, and they make me reconsider my drug use, but they didn't profoundly alter my life like in the dubious stories you hear about - 'my uncle's friend tripped on acid 20 years ago and he still thinks he's a glass of orange juice!'. Well, I haven't lost all functionality after this experience a few weeks ago, but it has left me with profound psychological damage.The night started at home. Snorting line after line of quality coke on my own. In retrospect, that in itself is indicative of huge problems. For whatever reason, I was not feeling high. I felt like I was on speed, not coke. So I did more and more and more, until finally I ate my last .3 grams. Note that this was over the course of 6 or 7 hours, so although I was in a pretty bad state I was not close to death.Even though I was still lacking euphoria, I was incredibly high to the point of psychosis. I convinced myself that the police were aware of what I was doing, that they were outside ready to arrest me. I tested this theory by throwing a few legal substances out of my window. Nothing happened. Obviously they were just trying to put me at ease. So I tentatively step outside. I see a black SUV parked up the street that I could not remember seeing before. I looked up the registration plate. Wow, it's done a lot of miles ... it's an undercover cop car! I'm going to prison! So I dash back inside. I have a stash of drugs. The only thing I want to do is get rid of them. But how? I can't burn them because the police would surely burst in and arrest me. So I decide to wrap them up into paper and walk down to the river and throw them. I walk out of the door with tons of ketamine, speed, LSD in my mouth and an eighth of trainwreck in my pocket. Shit! I can hear a police helicopter. FUCK! That's a police van in that alley! (I later realised it was a delivery truck; note that it was around 4AM at this time). I would have looked so high and sketchy at this point that I would have been arrested on the spot if a police officer passed me (I reasoned). And why waste drugs? So I suck out everything from the paper in my mouth then chew and swallow the paper. I take the 3.5 grams of weed out of my pocket and eat it. Then I wonder around disposing of drug-related paraphernalia.  After 10 minutes, I start feeling it. I can't remember exactly how it felt, but mainly a stimulant effect. My heart was getting faster and faster and faster. I genuinely thought I would die. I ran over to a taxi and paid him generously to take me to A&E. I get in and start shouting at them about everything I've taken, convinced I was dying. The staff and patients look at me like the pathetic human being that I am. I refuse to give them my name for a while. Eventually I do, they take me to a bed and hook me up to some sort of monitor.This is where my journey to hell began. Everything kicked in fully. I was completely psychotic, entering a nightmare hell that I would not leave for 10 hours. I could feel my heart going faster and faster and faster, faster than a hummingbird. I heard what I assumed was a heart rate monitor beeping erratically. I knew I was dying. I started shouting at everyone in the room (doctor, nurses, some other patients) to please look at me and if I was going to die just give me a sign. This went on for what seemed like an eternity. I then thought I was dying at that very moment. I somehow convinced myself that depending on my last words I would go to heaven or hell (note that I am not normally a religious person). Eventually, a security guard came over. He waved at me, and I took this as a sign that I had really and truly just died. I thought I was dead. I thought I was in hell. Some more nurses came and moved me to another ward. They talked to me, and I was expecting some horrendous torture to start at any point. I was looking out of the window at my hometown which I knew well and I thought it was all some hellish copy. My mother came to visit me and I thought she was simply a copy of my real mother, a citizen of Hell. I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. I tried to get up and leave and was forcefully carried back to the bed. I couldn't sleep, but I just lied down completely hopeless and preparing myself for the real hell to start.This carried on for a few hours. There was no real resolution, no sudden moment of sober clarity. Eventually they told me I could leave, and I walked back home. I laid down and slept for about 12 hours. I woke up and still thought I was in hell. The belief slowly dissipated over the next few days, but it comes back every single time I do LSD. I am not the same person I was before then.As to how much danger I was in of physical death or other problems, I don't know. But mentally, that was the worst experience of my life. And it's not a particularly uncommon one.Exp Year: 2017ExpID: 110692Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 21 Published: Jun 6, 2018Views: 7,608    Cocaine (13), Amphetamines (6), Ketamine (31), LSD (2) : Combinations (3), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Various (28) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:115 lbThe Cheshire cat lounged upon my tongue as I waited. A thousand teeth lit up the cavern of my mouth, anticipation speeding through my veins like a rocket. For the fifth time that minute I inspected my stereo. 11:44 AM, it replied, and I imagined its disapproval. “Kids these days,” it would mutter, stealing a patronizing glance in my direction before leaving my imagination and becoming lifeless once more. The Cheshire cat yawned. Had it pumped its secrets into my body yet? The stigma against psychedelics intrigued me, and eventually led to this day. I idly traced random shapes upon my living room coffee table, waiting for the trip to take me away. Hallucinogens don’t just happen- I let the tab sit on my tongue, and then I wait. And wait. And wait. Impatience ripped at my throat, a strange viper that showed no mercy. Defensively, I rose from the couch and paced around the room, fumbling at my cell phone, glancing at the piano, now the bookshelf, now the TV, attempting to trigger whatever this experience would turn out to be. How much longer? My mind and body were upset with me. They wanted a release.My eyes trailed to the Oriental rug. Burgundy, honey colored rings and wavy lines danced across its length. Isn’t it insane how our brain gives us the ability to distinguish these patterns? And what exactly are patterns anyways? My mind was lost in thought while my eyes danced along the fabric. This is just a photograph of life itself, I mused, like how I get fucked over, again and again and again. The brown and reddish lines were swimming in the larger pools of the cream colored background. For a second, I had the weirdest urge to jump into the carpet and surf along the shores of the fractals I saw. After weeks of what was the bastard child of agony and numbness, I felt connected. And god damn did it feel GOOD. I let out a sigh of relief which echoed electrically through the currents of my body. Energy. I had to move. I broke my trance with the rug and rose from the living room floor- I hadn’t even realized I sat myself down. I traversed to the kitchen, and there, in all its glory, lay my iPod. Why weren’t you listening to music before? My mind ventured, irritated. Milliseconds later, my headphones were on, and Radiohead was blasting through my skull in a dazzle of alien time signatures and chords that have yet to be named. Normally, I wouldn’t listen to Radiohead- I couldn’t understand their music and thought it was overly obscure. And there I was, staring into space listening to the ambience penetrating my eardrums. It smashed into me like a brick wall. The jigsaw fell into place out of absolutely nowhere. While I normally had no sense of rhythm, beats were beginning to reveal themselves to me and the strangeness became oddly clear; music was redefining itself. “Wow,” I whispered, and it was in this stretched out moment that the world opened her dreamy eyes and let me in. Having remembered the ever-sleepy Cheshire cat, I opened my mouth-cavern and pried the feline off my tongue. I couldn’t help but stare at the now faded contour that made up its face. Just like in Alice in Wonderland, its body was nearing invisibility, while its infinite grin tore through my field of vision. 'Couldn’t you have given me five more minutes?' The teeth didn’t move, but the cat seemed aggravated- the disappearing curves and lines were writhing around like wet noodles. It disturbed me, so I tossed the tab into the garbage, cat and all. “Well, that takes care of that.” It’s extremely unnerving to have inanimate objects be unhappy with you, so I left the kitchen, returning to the living room in search of adventures. The rug was literally throwing a dance party- I could see every thread and seam moving in unison with each other, swaying to my music. 'How can you hear my music from all the way down there?' I was mystified. “It’s because you are one in the same with the rest of existence, and you never bothered to realize that,” Life responded nonchalantly. “It’s because you are one in the same with the rest of existence, and you never bothered to realize that,” Life responded nonchalantly. If reality was truly based on perspective and perspective only, life had a point- everything around me was changing its shape based solely on what I was hearing. The wooden panels of my floor resembled nighttime on the fourth of July- the warped oak was expanding, contracting and wiggling around, and within the crazed orgy of movement I could discern faces that had no distinct features other than the emotions they conveyed- that one was happy, this one afraid, that one surprised- there were millions of them. And though they all were so different, they were the same. I had once again managed to sink to the floor, a fluid motion that felt like an elongated second. Once down, the floor became a cloud and the faces floated around me. I couldn’t feel myself sitting, which was odd, because I knew I was. “This is…so weird.” Did I just say that, or did I simply think it? I couldn’t tell, because Radiohead was set on grabbing my attention. My hands rose, and I began to conduct. Every swish and hand movement felt like a tectonic plate moving across millions of miles. The wooden faces danced to my conducting, changing their emotions and expressions every beat. I was a maestro. The synthesized music was reaching a climax and my head was rushing like a coaster in mid-drop. My hands became blurs, leaving salmon pink trails behind them every time I moved. Like comets. A benign pit in my stomach lifted me upwards, begging me to move. I couldn’t resist. Why would I refuse? and walked straight to my front door. My hand reached for the doorknob, its cold metal touch seeped through my skin, shooting through my body like an icicle. I was a snowman, but I could move. The door opened, my feet moved forward (though I couldn’t feel them) and the world was reborn. A bright, white light shredded my retinas, but I wasn’t blinded- I was seeing life for the first time. When the white smoke cleared, the colors that emerged sent me spiraling into a thousand thoughts that had no beginning, end or middle. Although late December was generally dreary in the Northeast, today…today was breath-taking. The strip of forest across the street was glowing, the bark much more purple than the brown it was supposed to be. Rather than seeing every tree as an individual, I saw them as a unified entity- they were melting to the ground while simultaneously shooting upwards. Mesmerized, I hadn’t even remembered to put my coat on and descended the stairs, zombie-like, towards the trees. The magenta branches were waving at me, holding hands, dancing underneath a sky that was burning sapphire. They were beckoning, calling my name, and it rustled through the wind which blew through my face. “Come to us,” they called, in a voice that was not verbal- it was too ancient to be auditory, for the trees were so very old and did not have the ability to speak. It was…telepathic.'How long have these trees been here for?' My mind asked me. “Who knows?” I responded, walking across the asphalt street which looked more like a stormy sea of blackness. “You think these trees are old? You do realize that there are redwoods that were born centuries ago? You can’t even begin to perceive a grain of time.” The trees were now in front of me, tall and looming. I walked beside them, without any particular destination in mind. I was too involved in my surroundings…but why? What did this mean? Why was I so transfixed on these trees? This asphalt? I still couldn’t feel my feet, but I sensed the movement. My mind was trailing into millions of directions at once, and at some random moment it hit me. I am being watched.This thought invaded every fiber of my being instantaneously, without any warning. It reminded me of those times when I was a child, when I’d face one direction in my sleep, petrified that a monster was about to rip my head off from behind me. But I didn’t have eyes in the back of my skull, so it could happen at any minute. And I knew it would- I felt its eyes searing through my spine, eyeing my body like fresh meat.“This is ridiculous,” I muttered. Was my voice shaking? Why? Why? My mind was chattering and I longed for it to shut up.I’MBEINGFOLLOWEDRUNAWAYI’MBEINGFOLLOWED. The feeling hit me once more like a thousand knives. IT’S GOING TO EAT ME AND GOBBLE ME UP. I jumped, whirled around, and came face to face with no one. I could have SWORN someone was behind me. What’s going on? Why is this happening? I didn’t like these feelings. I jumped, whirled around, and came face to face with no one. I could have SWORN someone was behind me. What’s going on? Why is this happening? I didn’t like these feelings. Uneasiness was now joining this new found paranoia and as I turned to seek comfort in the branches of the forest, uneasiness turned into pure fear. The branches that were purple just seconds before had become dark brown bramble and thorns dripping a black substance that oozed out of the pores of the bark. The thorns rose from the forest floor and were reaching out, reaching AT me, trying to grab me- each thorn was a spike that splintered off into a thousand other little thorns. They didn’t have mouths, and yet their mouths were foaming. They were after me. I heard myself losing control and screamed. Had I been rational, I would have realized just how loud I was. And the trees spoke to me.“Poor little girl, got yourself lost in Oz, have you?” it was the most malicious voice. It enjoyed my pain, it enjoyed my suffering. It wanted me to be afraid, and it wanted to get me. It fooled me into thinking it was behind me but GOD no it was NEXT TO ME. Oh my GOD. I felt fear physically for the first time- boiling lead poured down my mouth, my throat and spread into my esophagus tingling every nerve it could find. It controlled me and I tried to run, the world around me losing color by the second, becoming more and more alien. I ran, crossing streets, and roads, how fucked up I must have seemed, how so very crazy and manic. The trees were behind me, laughing, screaming and pointing their oozing, broken fingers at me.“COWARD! COWARD! COWARD!” their words hit me like bullets and panic was holding me down. I wanted to fall into the pavement (which now seemed translucent and blue) and hide. But I kept going. Before I knew it, my phone was in my hand, and I was struggling to remember numbers. “What are numbers? WHAT ARE THEY?” Mind shrieked, and the touch-screen was swirling with pixels that I couldn’t understand. After mindlessly punching in random digits and tearing my headphones off, I somehow managed to dial my friend, Karen. The phone was ringing, but to me it sounded like a blaring horn, blazing at a million decibels. I was still walking, though my legs now felt like pieces of steel. I was molasses, and I could barely move. As the horn ravaged my ear, I was nearing the a local Pond. “It’s…the best place…the safe place. It’ll be better. Right…? Right?” I couldn’t answer my minds whimpering, because I didn’t know. I didn’t know ANYTHING. I was a fool, and I was weak. I was a single human being, a human being plagued by madness and panic. “Hello?” Karen’s voice drifted from the metal pressed against my face into my head.Help me. I’m having a bad trip on acid. Help.” I babbled pathetically. My voice sounded robotic- it wasn’t my voice. I was losing my sense of identity…that wasn’t my voice. “THAT’S NOT MY VOICE” my mind was nearly wetting itself. But it wasn’t my mind anymore.“You’re what?! Try and calm down. It’s just a drug.” “HOW CAN YOU SAY IT’S JUST A DRUG?” I shrieked, and a couple birds flew out of a tree nearby. Their beaks dripping blood, and their faces were skeletal, burning through me with gazes that sent the urge to vomit straight through my system.“…Calm down. You’re overreacting. Where are you?” I couldn’t even respond. My throat was closed, closed by adrenaline, sewn shut by the fractals that were dancing through my peripheral vision. I didn’t want to answer her because:“She’s in on it. This is a scheme.” Mind said to me, and each word it spoke sent another jab of panic down my spine. “They’re all in on it. They want me to go crazy. Every single one of them. I’m fucked up. I’m dead. GAME OVER” My phone slammed to the ground and I followed. I saw a girl lying on the pavement by the pond. Contracted into the fetal position, rocking back and forth like a boat in a storm. Muttering gibberish. Was this me? Suddenly, I lost sense of existence. I was staring out into the world, but I couldn’t comprehend what that was. I just saw colors, lines and shapes. I didn’t know I was lying on the street, and I didn’t know what I was. I didn’t know I. I blinked, blinked and blink, and then every negative emotion and every positive emotion ever created rushed deep inside my brain and exploded there. If I was able to comprehend physicality, I would have screamed, but I just lay there, mental shrieks bouncing off my brain and into the nothingess of my minds oblivion. It was the loudest mute sound I had ever heard and it was tearing my insides apart. My organs melted and oozed out of my body. I took the damage. I was no longer seeing the physical world. I was seeing photographs of my past, but not visual pictures…it was more like a bat’s echolocation. Quick, sharp, blinking visions of rainbows and spectrums that was epileptic by nature. They spoke to me. 'Who are you?'I…I don’t know, I replied. All I could think about was how pathetic I was, and how broken and crazed. 'Why don’t you know?' The rainbows pulsated whenever they spoke, the colors shifting and changing with no actual order. They understood that patterns were simply figments of a humans need to comprehend the world around them.Be…cause nothing actually makes sense. That’s why. I’m crazy. And hated. The rainbows grumbled. They didn’t care for human emotions, for they had transcended that. 'You shouldn’t be here.'Those words stung like the black ooze that poisoned the evil trees from hours ago. No. I shouldn’t be here. Then the bile came like a flood, and I vomited. Again, I had no vision, but I could feel the panic and absolute fear pouring out of my body with the fluids torrentially. It was never ending, and the rainbows simply observed. What did it matter if I was dying? I asked of them. Does it really matter? I’m one fucked up human being, and I’ll be dead in minutes…the world is so unified, so BIG, and I know that you will go on and the world will be alright…isn’t that all that matters?The rainbows continued to exist, not answering me. Shadows without origin or fire leapt to and fro, adding dimensions to the colors. I remembered the trees again, and my self-loathing contradicted my feelings of unity with the world. I was a self-loathing martyr. My ego would die, and so would my body…but the world would go on, with one less screw-up…one less me. The rainbows faded, and I gained my sense of my physical surroundings. Panic still controlled me, regardless of the serenity the rainbows emanated- their tranquility was NOT for me, and my madness was growing like a tumor.“Go home. NOW.” Intoxicated by emotion, I grabbed my phone, unaware of the fourteen missed calls from Karen and began to walk from the way I came. The road beneath me stretched like a rubberband and it didn’t end. It kept going…on…and on…my legs started running but the road wouldn’t end. This was a nightmare. My mind was shrieking again, shrieking at this abomination, why the HELL were the laws of physics breaking down? This was a nightmare. My mind was shrieking again, shrieking at this abomination, why the HELL were the laws of physics breaking down? The road was sucking me under and I struggled to keep my head above the current. The asphalt was reaching out, calling my name like those god damn trees. It wasn’t going to end. This road is infinite. My heart was beating faster than 500 beats a second and I was losing my mind. I am a fool. I am pathetic. This road was my punishment.Millennia later, my house (resembling an amalgamation of shapes) came into view. It’s going to feel better…once I go inside. The doctor inside to me lied. I braved the stairs, glancing back into the strip of trees that destroyed me at the beginning of this nightmare and entered my house. It all seemed so different from this morning, but I couldn’t comprehend my surroundings very well. The world was spinning not unlike a carousel and I stumbled to the bathroom to continue my vomit fest. The bathroom tiles were no longer just in the wall- they were moving in and out of their natural places, almost 3D, while others seemed invisible. The square tiles on the floor were becoming circular. I was melting into them. The toilet chuckled and I lost whatever sanity I had left.Screaming, I ran into my room, bundling myself in my green comforter, only to be greeted by thousands of spiders that crawled on me, in me, and into my skin. I was dying. This was fear at its worst and I was losing my mind. Foaming at the mouth. This had to be over soon, right? Right? Then I’ll be okay…I won’t be crazy anymore, right, Doc? Right? Frantically, I looked across the room to my clock on the wall. Everything was buzzing a deep red, angry, infuriated, and evil. It wanted to end me. The clock read 12:30 PM. 45 minutes had gone by, and I had eight hours to go.The LSD had no intentions of stopping.Exp Year: 2010ExpID: 88579Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 19 Published: Jun 6, 2018Views: 8,235    LSD (2) : Alone (16), Entities / Beings (37), Music Discussion (22), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab) 2 mgoralPharms - Clonazepam(pill / tablet) 2 mgoralPharms - Clonazepam(pill / tablet)BODY WEIGHT:135 lbPreface: I am normally a pretty grounded person and perhaps that’s what caused me to hold back from letting the effects sink in. I wanted to trip because I really missed the nostalgia of the headspace and visuals I get when on a psychedelic. I went in with goals of feeling more in tune with my own families and psyche. I was with two friends, we will call them Ned and Arnold. Me and Arnold are friends since primary school so I decided to trip with him, as we had not yet done so together. We go to Ned’s place and play some PS3 until we decide to drop. The Drop: We take the tabs, mine was 155mcg with perforated edges, Arnold’s was 100mcg with clean cut edges. My friend asked how we were on psychedelics, and I joking said I get a little psychotic- if only I had known. We play one more match on the ps3 and go downstairs. We go in this recreation room with this semi-finished puzzle on a table. The Come Up: There’s this giddiness that builds up as I’m sitting in the rec room, and Arnold notes the same thing, I also notice this painting on the wall looks sort of popping out like a 3D screen. After we begin to feel more and more giddy we decide to go outside to the beach and walk around. At this point, the visuals are coming on stronger and it makes the sand look like the grains are dancing in a harmony along with the wind. We walk over to this storm drain, and mind that it was a cloudy dark day and as a matter a fact about to rain, so looking at the nasty polluted-looking storm drain kind of set me off in a bad headspace about where mother nature was headed. I definitely think the shitty weather and the fact that we were in a rather urban area of the beachside, had already set me off in a negative headspace. I definitely think the shitty weather and the fact that we were in a rather urban area of the beachside, had already set me off in a negative headspace. This was particularly frustrating because as any tripper knows, indoors is not a very comfortable environment to be in during a psychedelic experience. The Peak: We are still chilling at the storm drain, but at this point Ned and Arnold are conversing and I was finding it harder and harder to keep track of the conversation and stay coherent. I would start laughing about random thoughts flying through my head and I being a flat out stoner thought of a brilliant idea: to smoke some weed now that I’m at the peak. In hindsight it was a good thing I mentioned that because we had to go back to my car to pick up the bud, and in the middle of the way back, huge gusts of wind were hitting us and we saw a heavy rainstorm approaching land from the sea shore, so we hightail it back to Ned’s and go back to smoke. We smoke in this dark ass room with a fan to blow smoke out of, and there was this other compartment at the edge of the room that was dark and everything there seemed to be moving, and same with the ground and the different patterns on the ground. I remember taking only one out of a one hitter, I mostly gave some to Ned as a favor for him trip sitting us. What scared the hell out of me was that I felt this presence and out of the corner of my eye, in that compartment in the corner of the room, I saw the figure of a person, very vague, but he had blue pants a red shirt and seemed to be like porcelain white. I didn’t say anything about it and brushed it off. After a while we decide to go back upstairs and play some Fortnite. At this point I was going deep into introspect, I mean just lost in the sauce. And I was thinking jeez it’s so hard to think or even do anything for that matter. Then I don’t know if they were really saying it coincidentally, or if I was going delusional at that point, but it felt like my friends were saying exactly what I was thinking. And it didn’t help that Ned was on the phone with our friend Matt who was talking about someone else and saying how all they do was nothing with their lives and the least they could ever do was pick up the phone. For some reason I felt like Matt was talking about me and how all I could do was nothing but lay catatonically while Ned and Arnold play fortnite. The Freakout (Mid Trip): At this point, I don’t know what happened fully, but I think I began to be scared that since they were saying exactly what I was thinking that life must just be some sort of illusion and for that reason none of my actions mattered. I began to be scared that since they were saying exactly what I was thinking that life must just be some sort of illusion and for that reason none of my actions mattered. I would have these thought loops that what’s stopping me from doing nothing and everything at the same time, and just really paradoxical thinking. I was also really scared that life was just an illusion that concocted with its own history serving as an illusory backstory to keep me fooled and that my friends were my watchers and were like oh shit he knows  none of this is real, we’re gonna have to put him down. In reality they were like oh shit he’s tripping hard and he’s freaking out, and they tried to put some benzos in this bottled water so I can calm down. So when they gave me the water, I don’t know what I was thinking, I was convinced my friends were just illusions that my mind created as a coping mechanism for being the only sentient thing in the universe. I mean really deep delusional shit. I grabbed the water bottle and let all of the water spill out, which my friends were hoping I wouldn’t do because that water had 2mg of klonopin dissolved in it to calm me down. They kept telling me to take a benzo to calm me down. I was thinking since the illusion  is broken the damn benzos [don't] work on me anymore lol. In a way the whole illusion theory I had made me come to the conclusion that I was some sort of god, but I was scared of this and I rejected the idea, I felt like it would be a lonely principle to be a god. Because I would be the only one of my kind and would fear that my creations and companions would not have the same level of consciousness and sentience as myself. Also at this point I was scared because I felt like I was gonna be punished for breaking the illusion and felt like I was gonna be transported into another body, another life, another illusion I wouldn’t be aware of. Apparently I kept saying “what? No way!” I think that was me reacting to these delusions telling me  that I was god, and what didn’t help was Ned twitching his foot because it made me feel like I was going even crazier, like I felt like Ned twitching his foot was the illusion of reality glitching out due to me being aware it was all an illusion. I continued to go through this thought loop that I was god, and I was just so tired of it. I continued to go through this thought loop that I was god, and I was just so tired of it. By the time Arnold had convinced me to finally take a benzo, my other friend Andre arrived, and that helped calm me down too. By that point I was calmed down by the benzo but still convinced that I was god and I created everything and I was just talking about how impressed I was at how I got everything down to the particle. Apparently I went on a lot about fractals, Niel Degrasse Tyson and quantum particles. My friend Andre, just going along with it at that point joked around saying “I’m glad you got it down to the particle,” and “some would say you’re a rocket scientist.” And that really made it feel like they were also aware that reality was just my own concoction. So despite the benzos calming me down, I still had this “I’m god” headspace about me for another hour. After a while I go upstairs and take another benzo and call my mom, because during that experience I was worried I’d never see my family again.The Comedown and After Thoughts: After an hour or so, the 4mg of klonopin really killed the psychedelic headspace and I asked my friend if he could do me the favor of driving me home. At that point I just wanted to be with my family and call it a day. By this point also I was back in tune with everything and was glad and humbled that I wasn’t a god. Because that would be a hard and lonely job. I was glad that I wasn’t just in a world that was a figment of my imagination because I learned that would also be lonely as fuck, and I think that’s why during the trip I was grabbing at my friends hoping that their reactions were real and genuine. I am glad for one thought, and that’s how much I care about my family. Because that experience made me really miss them a lot and want to reconnect with all of them, because I feared that I would never see them again. I’m glad I went through this experience despite how challenging it was, because it both humbled me and renewed my appreciation for the ones I love. Perhaps it was the scariest trip I’ve had, but it may also be the most enlightening.Exp Year: 2018ExpID: 111973Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 19 Published: Jun 9, 2018Views: 2,063    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1) DOSE:3 hits LSD  1 hitinhaledNitrous Oxide(gas)BODY WEIGHT:150 lbCurrently I’m 21 years old... since I was 15 I’ve done I LOT of drugs... mostly lsd, speed, and E. Well one night changed my life forever and totally destroyed my ability to use drugs.One night at a club I was on about 3 hits of good lsd... They brought out the nitrous balloons and not thinking about it I grabbed a balloon. Now luckily I was on a couch or I don't know what would have happened. Well here we go I inhaled... just as I started to let out the hit my vision swirled. I got struck by a terrible fear... It was like waves of evil deja vu. The swirling pattern started to take form into a single image the fear was increased but I couldn't do anything. All of a sudden I the pattern stopped and I saw what look sort of like an outline of a fetus or something like that and I heard a noise it sounded like it said 'UH OH' in a robotic video game sort of tone... the little fetus thing charge forward across the room and everything went RED. Now when I say red I mean my eyes were wide open and all I saw was a red a blank red screen. I was trapped and this pounding in my head was constant and wouldn't stop it pushed harder and harder and then I saw the figure again in the red screen. It was sitting like in the position I was sitting It was like I was looking at an outline of myself from several feet above. I then put my hands over my face and started to freak I could see the little fetus pattern bumping its head into a wall over and over and the sound electronic sound was bad and now it was repeating 'you fu**ed up' over and over and over with a strong beat pounding in my head. The fear was still strong as it felt I was trapped It was if my mind knew this was going to happen and was laughing at me I was in HELL. It was a constant wave of deja vu as if this is what happens when you OD and it is an endless hell. Slowly I tried to uncover my eyes I looked up and everything looked like a robot everyone was dancing in robotic movements. Still I was so scared I'm surprised I didn't have a stroke or something. I felt like I had to leave the club but I could see myself getting up and leaving in my head and I knew that I was trapped here. I finally managed to speak to my friend next to my and said 'I need to get the hell out of here' he said ok... but I couldn't move and he was so fucked up I think he forgot what I said a second later...For the next 30 min I sat there in fear as the nitrous faded away and the fear slowly left...Now one year later there wasn't a day that passed I didn't think about that night but I thought it was just because of the mix of drugs and it wouldn't happen again. Well, If you thought that was the worst part of this story it gets worse... One night I decided to go to my friends and do some acid... now I usually took a lot of acid (like 6-8 hits) well for some reason I wanted to try 12 hits.It was night time I took the acid my other friends just drank and smoked some mj. We were watching x-men and it hit me. A sudden wave of panic the same feeling I had gotten that night... in my head I thought 'OH SH*T' I jumped up and jumped out his window(we always use the window to get in and out of his house) and tried to puke. The fear started to set in then it happened... everywhere I looked it was the fetus now in a circular pattern. But now it was everywhere the universe around me was breathing this image and with this much acid it wasn't going away. Now It’s to much to write but I was stuck in a 12 hour nightmare of fear and If I didn't have a strong will I would’ve killed myself.About 2 years after that lsd nightmare I hadn't done any drugs and swore of lsd and nitrous forever. I still have nightmares of the experience sometimes as I dream I get the fear and start to fall into it... I feel trapped and I can't move... It is a terrible feeling but luckily these dreams a very rare...  Iv'e tried meditation and other things but this nightmare still remains with me every day of my life Now that you have heard my story I just want to say I feel I have somehow killed a part of my soul I have wounded myself so deep that even 3 years after the first incident I still think about it daily. I feel I have ruined part of my existence forever and was scares me most is when I die I will be trapped in that endless void forever and all I can say is whoever is up there and takes us when we die..

I was fifteen at the time and dating an LSD dealer who I will call (M). For our new years we decided to go to an outdoor rave several hours drive from our home city, my friend who I will call (D) came along with us. At this point I had taken LSD twice in my life, each time only taking one tab, and I had never taken Ecstasy before.After we had set up our tent in the rain, we decided to have a look around the different zones and wait until it started getting dark before getting our party on. At around 7pm we headed back to our car and me and (M) took one tab of LSD each, and (D) took 2 BZP pills. We then headed off to a hard dance tent and waited for the stuff to kick in. After about half an hour I started noticing the effect of the acid, the lights twinkling more, dancing felt amazing and I had a huge grin on my face. I had begun to feel a little disorientated so (stupidly) said to (D) “Hey I think we should head back to the car and take the rest of the stuff before I get too fucked to find my way around', so we found (M) and walked back to the car. Once we got back to the car it had gotten quite dark and was raining. At about 8.00pm me and (M) took a second tab of LSD and an Ecstasy. While sitting in the car I noticed I had begun tripping quite hard, the broken glowstick on the bonnet on the car was about the funniest thing ever, all three of us were in stitches laughing at it, and then (M) and (D) pouring water from one bottle into another made me fall off my seat in hysterics (not to mention confuse the hell out of me). About 30mins after taking the second tab and the E, we started walking back to the dancefloor, I was holding (M)'s hand and ranting about everything that came into my head, I then noticed I was squeezing his hand very hard and squishing it around in my hand- and it felt so good! I grinned at him as we entered the dancefloor.On the dancefloor it was raining hard, there were about 150 people there and what seemed like A LOT of flashing lights, I was dancing with (M) quite happily for about 10mins, but then started to feel really weird, like liquid... and was also feeling very loved up. I started telling (M) that I loved him so much, I loved this place, I love dancing, I loved the music, I loved how I felt... I began to feel every drop of rain that hit my skin, and the lights and music became very overwhelming. From about this point I don't really remember much for the next 6 or so hours. What I will tell from now on is what (M) and (D) remember as they tried to look after me.After my banter about how loved up I was, I wandered to the side of the dancefloor near the forest and fell onto my hands and knees, grasping the mud and grass and then putting some into my mouth. (M) went and found (D) and they lifted me up off the ground and walked be between them away from the dancefloor. We had to stop at every muddy puddle for me to have a barefooted stomp in. When (M) went off to find some help for me, (D) stayed with me beside a car, I remember hugging her and telling her that I loved her, and then started biting her neck until she pushed me away. When (M) came back we started walking back to our tent, I can remember holding (D)'s hand and saying over and over to her 'We're melting together!! We are becoming one!!' as I grasped her arm very hard and dug my nails into her.Once we got back into the tent, they decided I needed a drink, so tried to pour water into my mouth which I dribbled all over my chin and down my front (i can vaguely remember this feeling really amazing) then they decided maybe if they got (M) to put it from his mouth into mine I would drink, which just resulted in him getting his tongue bitten. At some point I started screaming random stuff like 'I can talk... I can scream!!!' (I can remember feeling as though I had discovered myself, or had just been born and was finding all this stuff out about myself I can remember feeling as though I had discovered myself, or had just been born and was finding all this stuff out about myself). When I had stopped screaming I started having a fairly normal conversation with (M) and (D) about things such as sports and school when I told them that I need the toilet... so (D) took my outside and took my tights, skirt and underwear off, as I lay on the ground trying to kick her. Once she had managed to get my clothes off I kicked her quite hard and crawled/ran off away from her and collapsed into the muddy grass and started shovelling the grass and mud into my mouth and with the other hand was masturbating.Eventually (M) and (D) got me back inside and put a pair of boxers on me and tried to hold me down, I managed to take the boxers off myself and started telling (M) to fuck me... but at the same time violently bit and scratched both of them. This carried on for about 20mins, and then would cease as I lay motionless on the floor of the tent talking to myself. At this point where I was talking to myself, I can very vividly remember walking around the rave site with (M) and (D) saying things to them like 'Is everyone tripping out like me?, Are they all feeling like this?' and I remember trying to figure out what was happening, and eventually I 'figured out' that we were all playing this giant game, and that (M) and (D) were in on the secret, but I was clever and had just figured it out I told them this, and then can remember (M) saying 'And she gets it....' But according to my friends, all these conversations I had with them was really just with myself talking as me and as both of them as I lay on the floor of a dark tent. At one point over the night, I urinated on my friend as she tried to hold me down, this really just goes to show exactly how little control I had over myself.Over the course of the 6 or so hours I went through 3 different personalities that my friends described to me. Over the course of the 6 or so hours I went through 3 different personalities that my friends described to me. One was semi-normal where I would sit up and have normal conversations and be calm, just talking about everyday life. One was quite violent, I would scream, try hurt both of them, masturbate, yell at them to fuck me and try rip the tent down. And the other I would just lie down and keep talking to myself and twitching.When I had calmed down a little, (D) went back to the dancefloor and (M) lay with me, I can remember waking up... feeling very confused, very sick, very sore and felt very 'empty', like I had no emotions left. (M) looked at me and smiled, he looked very tired. I smiled back at him and went back to sleep. Once it had gotten light I woke up, hearing (M) and (D) talking, I crawled out of the tent and looked around, seeing my clothes scattered around the tent. At this point (M) and (D) told me all about what had happened...I now know what a stupid fucking idea this whole experience was, I warn everyone to not ever try something like this.

I waited 30 mins, then took 1 more hit.After going to the bar, I started to go into my trip.It started out rough and I knew there was no way I would be able to handle this while in the bar I was in.(I have never done that much before)So I was dropped off home and I calmed down a bit.Wacthed 'finding nemo' and enjoyed my trip.A big fear overcame me , the feeling of dying or going insane.I knew it was the drug and ran out and calmed down,I got fresh air.My girlfriend came and she never done acid before.Barely handling it myself (stupid des.) I gave her 2.5 hits for her first time.It hit her in less than 15 min. After 40 min of experiencing the nice mood elevation, wall vibrations and tracers.She went into a full blown bad trip.I never seen one. I was def. Scared because I didn't know what to do.It began with her looking at her skin and then she started to freak out.It kinda sobered me up even though I was still in my trip.Her skin scrawling, with bugs, she would get often naked and say that she was bleeding from her vagina.She would also jump on me ask for me to fuck her then immediately run away and yell their on me.[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] I didnt know what to do.My only hope was to find her friend to help me calm her down.2am in a college town with a naked girl screaming and punching the windshield of a car I was driving while still triping is not a good idea to say the least.I get to her friends house, she wakes them up and runs around etc. I explain to them what happened. I get some pills and I took her homeThe pills were thorazine (to treat imbalance in the brain/ bipolar etc.)I give her one and in 20 mins she beginsa to calm down.And I give her another one.I also take oneIt feels Like eveyrthing is slowing down.My heart stops racing, I feel calm.I feel light and my mind is tingly and feel really nice.

We got a hold of 4 hits of blotter acid and headed for the hills. We each started of dropping one hit.The weather was beautiful and the temperature was comfortable. (Being a norwegian living on the west-coast, this is not always the case, so we learn to appreciate the few days we get.)We were fooling around the mountainside enjoying the woods, waiting for the effects. Nothing apart from the familiar tingling and some mild giggling. This lead me to believe that the hits we had got, where low in quality. This was not the case.As we decided to take to the top of the hill, a thick fog came upon us. We figured that even though we were not off our heads, we decided to go back down. (It is very easy to get lost in these hills, being covered with quite dense forrest.)It was now about an hour and a half into the first hit. (T+1.5h) We figured it was about time to drop the last hit, feeling it safe based on the first one. When we got back into town we went back to R´s house, dropped the last two hits and sat on his porch for a while. We were still feeling a slight tingle from the first hit, but we were both hungry for a slightly more profound experience. Suddenly R points out that we had nothing to smoke later on, so we headed over to a contact of his, to buy some hash. When we got there we told him (R´s contact) that we had dropped acid, just to clarify, in case the second hit should be stronger than the first, and we would start to act weird. It was now T1+2.5h, T2+1h.We were sitting in the apartment of this friendly couple smoking some bongs and just having a nice time. We had both nearly forgotten about the second hit.It struck me hard! I was suddenly overwhelmed with strong visuals. I informed R about it and that I thought it be best if we got going. He agreed and the host couple totally understood. I did not want to lose control in the home of strangers, no matter how friendly they were.We got out on the street and headed for R´s house. I could feel the acid really coming on in strong waves. I was new in town and not so familiar with the part of town my friend lived. I explained to him that I had no idea where we were. He assured me that we were on the right way.By this stage I was experiencing total confusion and I relied on my friend to get me to 'safety'. Even though it is only a 3 minute walk, it felt like forever. I was getting more and more paranoid, not able to shake the sinister feeling that R was not what he seemed. We were pacing along. R was probably a bit stressed to get me back to the apartment, so that we could lay back and let the acid have its way with us. TOO LATE!At this point I lost all confidence in R.This happened as we came to a playground that was just about 100m away from his apartment! This place looked so alien and when I looked at R he looked more like a joker, with evil intentions. His eyes were completely black and his smile was pure evil. The paranoia caused my confused mind to 'shut down'. Everything turned white and I can still remember shaking my fist at the sky demanding answers as to what the HELL was going on. R was still trying to pull my arm and get me to safety. A this point that was completely impossible, as I was convinced he had evil intentions. From here on I must have been wandering around. I can recall moments of clarity, when I could navigate. Identifying a  sign for a bakery which I headed for. It was only about 50m away, but it felt like an eternity. I felt like I was trapped in a loop and that I had been striding the same block for ever. I could not tell if I was alive or if I had gone to hell, and it being a state of eternal repetition.  After this I can not recall anything but short glimpses of my way home.I came to in the middle of the night, having been rolling around my bed for a few hours. I felt really bad about abandoning R and got in touch with him. He had been really worried about me. We sat down smoking some joints talking about what we had experienced. He had not been tripping as hard as I, but me flipping out and he worrying about me probably ruined his trip. I think that if we had just gotten back home before the big wave hit, it would have been an awesome trip.For me this experience made it clear how important it is to be in a 'safe' area. Most of the times I´ve dropped acid it did not matter where I was. Being in control of my self. But some times the stuff really hits and its important to have a retreat/safehouse.Even though it was a rough trip, those are probably the most educational and I would not change it for anything. Did I mention it was on friday the 13th? Keep humble, keep dreaming, keep loving!Exp Year: 2003ExpID: 60233Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jul 13, 2018Views: 794    LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Various (28) DOSE:2 tabletsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:165 lbAcid From HellSo I had just dropped 2 hits of acid questioning the real strength of this drug and oh boy was I wrong about itDosed at midnight, by 1 oclock I was playing halo 2 on my xbox 360 when I got this sudden burst of energy and then I look around the basement and I see all these colors pertruding out of the ceiling tiles. Just to let you know this waas my first time and I was in my basement without any1 to watch me. So then I hurd my dad coming down the stairs so then I ran to my bedroom which was dark and hid uner the covers and closed my eyes. Then I get very sweaty and panicky and started hearing these loud sounds as if my dad came down and through evreything to the ground, and then I questioned reality thinking mayb I was throwing evreything to the ground and I just wasnt seeing it kind of like an out of body expierence, and this terrified the hell out of me so then I opened my eyes and looked around my basement and saw evreything was normal and that ended the peak of my tripThe next couple of hours sucked the worst, I couldnt go to sleep, tremors, loss of appetite and my body tempature went up about 10 degrees and this lasted for the next 16 hours I am lucky my trip wasnt worse and the come down of lsd is sucks and I needed about 3 days to recover from it-dave 17/illinoisExp Year: 2006ExpID: 55318Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 17 Published: Jul 14, 2018Views: 1,363    LSD (2) : Alone (16), Hangover / Days After (46), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), First Times (2), General (1) DOSE:1 tabletoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:120 lbSince beginning my relationship with psychedelics about a year ago, I’ve become a strong proponent of the mind-opening properties that acid delivers. I feel lucky to say that, after a trip I never thought I would have, I still love this drug.Three friends and I made the trip to TN for the 2008 Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. We are all reasonably experienced LSD users (T having taken it the least at six times), and had for quite some time been planning on tripping Friday, the second night of the festival.Evening came and went on Friday, and we grew more and more excited at our campsite. We were all eagerly anticipating trying our new “Rolling Stones” blotters, which were a significantly higher dose than many previous trips (an estimated 250 micrograms). At 10pm, we each dropped 1 blotter hit (I took very slightly less than one and C took very slightly more), and headed to the festival’s center to watch the end of Metallica’s show. Joining a massive crowd made me feel uncomfortable before even really coming up, so the four of us walked around a bit. We took a seat on a bench on the side of a locked barn on the grounds, where countless people tried unsuccessfully to get in. About two hours and many Sour Patch Kids after dosing, we headed to a tent to watch MSTRKRFT perform. Two guys sharing a blunt with a crew of dancers waving Canadian flags on either side of them seemed incomprehensibly cool to me, and I imagine, to everyone in attendance. I thought the girl dancing next to me looked like Nelly Furtado (with no idea if she actually did), and enjoyed seeing her dance, but the guy she was with appeared to be confused every time I glimpsed over, which for one reason or another unsettled me. I found myself too careless to hold on to anything, so C took my sweatshirt as I gave away my glowstick to a very happy crowd member. Every so often I’d glance at people that were leaving the show. They seemed like they couldn't stop dancing, and that unsettled me even more.  Rather quickly, people all around me started to look panicked, and I decided I wanted to leave. C, T and I left the tent and emerged into the rain.We tried to find a tree to sit at by the Comedy Tent. C had one picked out but it didn't seem like we were getting any closer even as we marched on. I realized I was freaking out and told him I needed to leave, fast.  As confusing as Centeroo was to me, it was impossible to get my bearings in the current state and I quickly entered a panicked mindset. I was hallucinating endless rows of identical trees, and everywhere I turned, the Ferris wheel was in my direct line of sight. Leveling up Plasma Pong-like electronic music was all I could hear. I grabbed C’s hand as tight as I could and spiraled into a place so dark I had no idea my mind was capable of such thought. I also thought I was in the process of ruining the almost two-year relationship between him and me. I repeatedly voiced how scared I was and that I wanted to go home. Everywhere I looked were fractals and various geometric shapes, and I seemed to briefly experience a sense I don't normally have while walking past a wall designed for people to paint graffiti onto. Everywhere I looked were endless rows of camping tents, flags, cars, and vendor tents. It was raining fairly hard at that point (somewhere around 3 hours into the trip), and I thought I was the cause of the inclement weather. I recognized the Bonnaroo arch, aforementioned graffiti wall, and the infamous grilled cheese stand on the way to our campsite, all of which I considered small victories. After some difficulties finding the campsite, the three of us ended up back at the tent, where I entered the worst part of my night. I was consumed by mind-numbing fear, the likes of which I can't even really comprehend now, after the fact. At this point I buried my head in C’s lap and thought I was about to die (the feeling can only be described as being at the final step before death, whatever that may be. C later suggested I may have been approaching ego death here). My overwhelming feeling was one of embarrassment and shame, and I knew how embarrassed my parents would be if they knew what I had done. A guy in a scary outfit walked by and I thought he was an alien (I was later informed that a person in a scary costume had actually in fact walked by our campsite at that time). C put on recognizable songs (Transatlantic All of the Above, followed by Porcupine Tree’s Collapse the Light into Earth and a few more All of the Aboves), and slowly I started to improve. We entered our tent, where I cried and cried and begged him not to tell various people. He was calming and reassuring, and even in my state I knew I was in the best hands I could be in. Walking through endless swarms of women wearing tank tops at the festival, my prominent closed-eye visual pattern is best described as “kaleidoscopic boobs.” I knew I was compounding my problems through too much circular thinking, though knowing didn’t help. Aware that I was the reason C was missing two other acts we had looked forward too was certainly no help either. I felt like a small child, too overwhelmed to even change out of my clothes. We talked about things that were particularly bothering me at the time, and he gradually brought me away from a state of panic. Eventually (Around 4 or 5 am) I felt ready to emerge from the tent. It was as though I was emerging from the cocoon I had spent the last few hours in. Time, thankfully, passed very very quickly, but I felt as though a sinister aura was surrounding me for the rest of the night and into the next day (visuals lasted around 8-9 hours, albeit much lighter as time went on). During our first trip to Centeroo of the following afternoon, my strongest urge was to cry, though I curbed that feeling throughout the afternoon. I wondered if I would ever feel “normal” again. I got my answer later that evening, where my group of four was able to enjoy brilliant performances by Sigur Ros and Ghostland Observatory, and thankfully could enjoy the rest of the festival as though my mind hadn’t completely broken from reality the previous night. 	My Bonnaroo trip was a perfect example of set and setting being so crucial for tripping. Having never had a bad trip (before or after Bonnaroo), I learned that too much overwhelming input in an unfamiliar place can be disastrous. Now, I consider that night a learning experience, but will take precautions to ensure it doesn’t happen later on. I am so happy that I still intensely enjoy tripping acid, but now truly understand how powerful it can be.Exp Year: 2008ExpID: 72573Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jul 18, 2018Views: 1,109    LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Guides / Sitters (39), Festival / Lg.

It was a stormy night, and I was talking to a friend about LSD on the internet, and I told him I had some, he told me I should try it, and that it is completely safe, he was an experiences tripper and could guide me safely through the trip.5.00PM I trusted him alot, and decided it was a good idea, my parents werent going to be home for along time, so I decided to slip one in, and my friend gave me instructions on my first, It was fine, and he later told me it is only dangerous if I have more.5:30PM Still no effect, my friend was beggining to say I was jipped and had Purchased 'Blank Blotter' so he insisted I tried another, just to make sure, so I did, but it was different this time, and I felt it beginning to kick in.5:35PM All was good, I was explaining my trip Blankly to my friend, and he said its all good fun, and was encouraging like a good friend was, but he then insisted that I was taking a low dose, and the blotter was proberbly half dipped, and Not as Strong, without telling him, I slipped in another.5:45PM The high hit me like a wall of bricks, I was messed up, and alone, I explained to my friend I had another, I couldnt even type, and I fell to the floor Cluching my Chest, as it Began to Rain extremely Loud.6:00PM My friend explained I should go hard, or have none at all, the image constantly hit my head, I heard voices telling me to have the other, and I think the last tab was what braught me to insanity, so I had it, and I was ripped.6:10PM For 10 minutes, I constantly struggled around the house, I was scared, everything was comming at me, I heard Voices, voices of my parents, screamming and yelling, I ran into my room and lied down trying to sleep it off.6:15PM I was lieing in my bed for about 20seconds before I forced myself to get out, I was sinking inside, like I was struggling to get back out, I rolled out of the bed and hit hard on the floor, I thought I was going to die, I continously rolled over, I didnt care what I did I just wanted to get out of the trip.6:30PM I constantly ran around the house, trying to exhaust myself to try and get rid of it as fast as I could, I heard ringing and screaming, I picked up the phone after I heard a ring, and continuesly shouted HELP! FU**ING HELL HELP! IS ANYBODY THEIR?? I couldnt hear voices, or nothing, the phone clutched around me like it was stuck to my neck, I ran around trying to wear it off.6:50PM The trip was in its full force, I was crawling around in a dark corner of the house, moving and screaming, I saw thousands of things moving, I clutched myself deeper inside, trying to shake out of it, but it was no use, I was going to die.7:20PM I couldnt take it, I tried to ring friends but the phone numbers vanished, and moved around, and I couldnt remember them, I was braught to my knees with the phone in my hands, and collapsed.My tripping days were over.4:30AM Horrible, I woke up on the kitchen floor, with the phone in my hands, I had the immediate recognition my parents had seen me in this state, and just left me their, the trip was wearing, I could feel it, but it may had been a dream, I read the clock, and it was stable at 4:30AM, the trip had gone, and as much as I can say I was fine, I went back to the computer, to see  about 500 messages from my friend, trying to talk, and getting worried, it is alot better to know now, that I feel like I was not truly alone on my trip.I should have never taken LSD alone.Exp Year: 2003ExpID: 23701Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jul 24, 2018Views: 1,356    LSD (2) : Alone (16), Guides / Sitters (39), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5) DOSE:320 ugoralLSD(blotter / tab)   smokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:155 lbIt was Thursday night and I had no school on Friday so I decided to take four 80 ug tabs. Previosly I had been tripping constantly. I would say I'm experience as I've had 41 trips In last year. ( I know that I shouldnt or that it can lose its magic but Its always amazing and I never feel burnt out after) anyway, so I left home in a happy mood once I could feel the effects, I surprisingly havnt noticed any tolerance issues with the amount I do.I got a ride from 2 good friends of mine to a party going on but when I got there the party had just ended so I felt bummed out because I had to walk home. Suddenly my buddy, lets call him Trevor comes out of nowhere and I asked if he wanted to smoke up alittle. He agreed. I sat in his room and felt a chill go down my spine. Visuals arent that apparent untill I took 3 or 4 tokes. I needed to breath and think so I asked him to tell the music off for a few minutes and instead, he decided to put on pink floyed another brick in the wall.At this point I'm super on edge of a bad trip. He offered my chocolate milk and I accepted but then he kept pouring glass after glass and practically was forcing me to drink cup after cup. If things couldnt get worse he decide he was gonna show me his new axe when I wasnt paying attention. As soon as this guy takes the weapon out I'm conviced he wants to kill me. I insist on leaving but he kept trying to force me to stay. I finally managed to get out and the road is getting longer. I wasnt sure if I crossed the road that a car was gonna appear out of thin air so I ran. As I slowed down, to avoid police I went through a back alley where a gas station is and I hear a group of people taking about 50 - 70 feet away at the gas station. As soon as I came around the corner the voices stopped and the group was almost anticipating that I was gonna be around that corner because they all stared at me from a distance while I walked.There was a car dealership and they had a outdoor light that was shinking on a sign they had. I noticed that it was constantly flicker like a horror movie. As I walk across the town bridge the beams are lit up red and the bridge (made of wood and extremely long) seemed like it wouldnt end but I've walked that bridge many times sober and know that it is only a 5 minute walk but seemed like 20- 30. The rest of the walk home I felt as though somebody was gonna attack me at any second.Exp Year: 2017ExpID: 111153Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 16 Published: Jul 24, 2018Views: 892    LSD (2) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Various (28) DOSE: T+ 0:001 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 3:001 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:130 lbNearing the end of a sunny late spring day in the Pacific Northwest, I decided 'now is the right time'. I had been doing research on LSD off an on for the past decade, determined to someday try it, but only when the time was right. While I have experience with a handful of drugs, I am by no means a stoner. I hardly even drink. I'm not against it I just prefer to do things in moderation and under relatively specific circumstances. I had acquired a couple tabs from a trusted friend 2 months earlier, and was just waiting for the opportune moment. This was it.I had previously asked my friend D to tripsit me when the time came. He was available and down to hang out with me all night, so he came over. I was actually house sitting at the time, in a really nice, big house owned by a retired University professor. It was filled with many types of houseplants, exotic art, and also contained (when he felt like being inside) a very talkative and extremely large cat. I felt like it was just the perfect setting to trip.I took my first tab as soon as D told me he was leaving his house (he lived about 10 minutes away) and started to keep a journal. I set a bunch of alarms on my phone, one every 30 minutes for 10 hours, to remind me to take note of what I was experiencing. I set a bunch of alarms on my phone, one every 30 minutes for 10 hours, to remind me to take note of what I was experiencing. This trip report will consist of my typed up journal entries, transcribed voice recordings that I made, and some things I wrote immediately after coming down, along with some further reflections and other details that may explain things, give context, or other wise be of interest.T: 0hrThis tastes odd. It takes longer to dissolve than I had expected. I feel like an idiot for eating paper. I make a pitcher of pink lemonade, and repeatedly almost choke.T: 0hr30mI feel a little light. I'm probably imagining it. I'm drinking some lemonade. I should probably turn off the answering machine beeping before it drives me mad.T: 0hr:44mNot imagining it. Real. I like it.T: 1hrI failed to skip a line [in the notebook, as I have previously between entries], FUCK! It'll be okay. I feel soooooo good! Like happy! And tickled! I just want to flex all my muscles until they POP. Oh, my handwriting sucks. I hope I can effectively keep this journal [for the duration of the trip]. Pink lemonade was a risky choice. Ugh. Mucus. Oh, so we're in past tense now? Or were. I've always been shit at that.T: 1hr15mOK I just feel like saying something. I'm really enjoying silence right now. I'm a very visual person, and I'm not like, hallucinating or anything. I just feel like my visual input is really important. It's like 90% of what I care about.T: 1hr30mOh, just kidding, I'm hallucinating as fuck. It's beautiful! I can't stop smiling. How bad is my writing? I'm under drops of water. I feel like its physically happening to my eyeball.T: 2hrI already hate the fact that I need to write and can't just instantly communicate. Focusing on writing intensifies visual hallucinations. So much vibrating and squirming but its so pleasant. I find it odd that it's pleasant as if I should be repulsed. I'm giggling at my writing. It's very poor.T: 2hr30mI have to focusintenselytowriteanditsveryunpleasantsoI'mgoingto stop I JUST FOCUSVERY IMPORTANT the beautiful sunset more colors than I thought were possible I had never felt so HAPPY I'm going back.T: 3hrJust took the 2nd tab. I feel intensely compelled to document, but not in a medium I can understand. I'm sorry!! I'm worried I won't remember. How about 'yellow'?At this point I was feeling quite loopy and wanted to lie down. I told D that I was going to go chill in bed with some blankets for a bit because I just needed to. In between writing my journal entries, my interactions with D were fairly limited. When he showed up he proclaimed 'I just took a shitload of shrooms before I left.' Since we had previously (on a different day) agreed that he would be sober while I tripped, I was disappointed in him and slightly concerned. Ultimately, we got really giggly about nothing in particular and each wandered around the house looking at things, and I mostly forgot about it.He seemed content with hanging out in the living room so I went and snuggled into the bed. I probably laid down in the bed for about 2 hours, I was very relaxed and slightly overstimulated by all the visuals which were increasing in intensity every passing moment. I really did not want to move. I decided to continue my documentation of my trip via voice memos on my phone. I have transcribed them here. Important note: The AJ that I refer to is my boyfriend. I have to provide a little backstory here about why so much of this trip became centered around him. At the time of this trip, we had been seeing each other for about 5 months. He was in college in a different city a couple hours away, so we saw each other about every other weekend. Things had gotten really serious a couple months earlier when I casually mentioned that I was going up to [city] to buy LSD from a friend. This led to an all night conversation (via text) during which he expressed extreme distrust of the drug, and did not want me to use it. I tried to explain that it was very low risk and was important to me. I know that he had dated a drug addict before and was sensitive about these things. Ultimately the conversation led to me saying I would gladly delay my taking it if it made him uncomfortable, that I placed a greater importance on our relationship, and we told each other that it was love for the first time that night.Eventually AJ said he had loosened up his feelings about it, that he trusted me much more than anyone else he knew in his life who he associated with drug use, and I took that as more or less a go ahead, but I certainly wasn't going to be in his face about it. It was ALWAYS meant to be a personal journey for me. I had decided on this occasion that I would tell him after I had done it, so that he wouldn't worry about me from afar, nor would I worry about him worrying about me.Our relationship was (and is still) one of immense passion and I have always had very strong feelings about him. I did not want to lose him but I also very much wanted this for myself.Well..on to the recordings. The headings above the recordings are the filenames as they were in my phone, some of them were changed.Recording 1I’ve been making it a goal to document my experiences, on the half hour, every half hour, at the very least. I am free to do it more frequently should the urge arise. [sighing and giggling noises] Hang on.Recording 2Ok. I am having a hard time talking into this because I just want to laugh. The reason that I’m making this recording is that i don’t think I’m going to be able to write. Every time I try to focus on writing, the visual hallucinations get really intense, and its really hard to….[giggling]…I don’t want to sound like a crazy person. Recording 3Its fair to say that I am definitely going to sound a little bit like a crazy person. [sigh] Part of the issue is that I’m trying to be kinda restrained. I’d like to not feel that way, but I’m not alone in the house…so I can’t be free. Not truly.Recording 4I have decided, firmly, that: Fuck Cats.Recording 5[giggling] Jesus Christ, um, ok. [way more giggling] I am now on recording number 5. And I swear I am sticking to the original plan [uncontrollable laughter] of why I am fucking making this recording. Oh my god. [laughing] Nope! Not happening.Recording 6This is a very serious subject matter. It’s greatly profound, and it’s of grave importance that I communicate this clearly, eloquently, and with proper levity.Recording 7Except I keep trying and giggling and stuff so yeah, clearly this is just the pinnacle of human existence.Recording 8AJ, I forgot to use your name in all the other recordings, cause…the underlying feeling is I’m not telepathic, and that’s really frustrating. Like I feel like I should just be able to instantly impart emotion and sensation into somebody else, and that was what I wanted to do. Why I started making these recordings and then I started getting giggly cause its supposed to be serious. I just wanted you to know that I was having what I perceived to be a profound experience, and I was thinking about you, and like that experiencing it without you is kind of a deficit in my experience. But that’s ok. It was just like the realization that you couldn’t just feel what I felt, filled me with a real sadness. i’m just experiencing emotions like purely. [laughs] It’s definitely extremely pleasant. I’m actually just trying to stay really calm right now so that I can talk. Probably a lot of what I’m saying sounds completely insane. I just realized that. I don’t really know when I’m speaking out loud versus when I’m just thinking. This like line between consciousness….that part all makes sense. It’s all very blurred. Like I get why that’s always brought up. It’s just like you feel like you should be able to know and feel everything at the same time, and you kind of do, and it’s really awesome. Hey this recording went like a full fucking ten times longer than all the other ones. Good job, go me, I’m gonna stop it now.The Most Important One (allegedly)Holy fuck, okay. Hopefully I remember to rename this accordingly. Just, disregard all the other ones. This is what’s important. I was having a profound experience, or what I thought was one, whatever, doesn’t matter. And I missed you during it. That’s the sweetest thing that I can give you. Also I’ve been talking about this for fully a half hour now, fuck.((SIDE NOTE: The 'profound experience' I am referring to here was essentially me watching a particularly beautiful sunset. I'm sure that sober it would have been quite spectacular, one of those really dramatic sunsets with sweeping clouds and varying shades of purple, orange, and magenta. I was experiencing some distinct time dilation, as I know logically a sunset only lasts a matter of minutes, but it felt like hours that I was staring at the sky in pure awe. I have never seen Aurora Borealis in person, but the way the clouds shimmered and waved reminded me of it. The entire time I was watching this I felt utter joy, the likes of which I cannot remember experiencing before.))Recording 9Ok, I’m letting myself off the hook for abandoning the document stuff every half hour thing. Mostly because I am documenting it, just in a different way. But I also just have to accept that if I want to enjoy myself I can’t force myself to write. It just…its….unpleasant. So, I do want to document whats happening, so that I can remember, and for I dunno, informational purposes I guess. I just have to do it in ways that feel natural, I guess.Recording 10What could be more natural than curled up in bed with an iPhone. I can’t imagine anything. It’s beautiful [laughs]Self AwarenessThis is cliche as fuck. I think I’m gonna title this one “self awareness” and…it’s not funny.Recording 11Oh I keep being super not scientific about this. Like the whole reason why I wanna document things…I just keep ignoring the things that I would want to write down, like what the actual visual effects are, and what I’m avoiding when I’m not writing. All the colors. Just, every color. Especially the like, uh, the acid ones. [laughs] derp. You know the neon, whatever. All that. Is just happening. But when I focus really hard, like on writing for example, cause like right now I’m just letting my eyes do whatever the fuck they want. Which is…I don’t even wanna know…what it’ll look like. Just, its all over the place. Ohhhh no….the creature is up. It’s fine. He just goes…..you know…nature is calling…I can assume [crashing noises] Fucking christ, some things never change. Ok. The colors. That’s what I’m avoiding. It sounds really nice. That’s the thing…all the physical sensations, all the visual sensations, are things that should not be pleasant but are. Thats the crazy thing. And the only thing that’s unpleasant is resisting it. Let the vibrations happen and it just feels really good. But like you try to hold still so you can sense them, and everything starts to go all like, putrid, and the colors, instead of being this like harmonious rainbow fractal awesomeness is like bruises and sickness and like vomit. It’s really gross and you want it to just not be happening anymore and it’s super easy to make it not be happening anymore. All you have to do is relax and stop resisting. Time is a little bit different, which is what I expected, which is why I set alarms for myself so that I could document properly. I’m just a step ahead of myself the whole time. Anyways, feels like it’s been like 3 hours and it’s been 3 minutes and that’s just the nature of this, I suppose. I’ll stop.Recording 12This is a….mad props to myself for my restraint and not sending these.((SIDE NOTE: I wanted very desperately to share with my boyfriend, as I was feeling a profound amount of love for him, but it was the middle of the night and he had class in the morning, and in the back of my mind I was worried he would become upset and not understand if I told him that I was tripping.))Recording 13Oh god! Not sending them until some time that I will send them, and that I’ll just have arbitrarily decided is the OK time, so that I can continue to congratulate myself. Ohhhh I get it, this is fun, this is a fun game. I’m really sad that you’re not doing this game with me.((This made complete sense to me at the time, and I do know what I was driving at. Basically I was becoming increasingly aware of myself, my attitudes towards myself, and the way I justify my behavior. Basically I was becoming increasingly aware of myself, my attitudes towards myself, and the way I justify my behavior. I was pleased with the objective level of insight I was feeling.))Recording 14This is me being sad again at my failure to commit to writing in the notebook. I wanted to have that artifact. And now I’m not gonna have that artifact. I’m just gonna have like, part of one. That annoys me.Recording 15This is also important. I feel like I am just completely objectively evaluating everything. Like I…ff…I’m just going off an an—whoooo, I dunno what that’s gonna look like in the finished recording, but I just got like my….it’s 11 o clock alarm, in the middle of trying to say a sentence, and uh, yeah. I have no fucking idea what I was talking about. Probably something super important and you know about consciousness and all that bullshit—ooh spiders!Recording 16Yeah I keep thinking I’m seeing spiders like really creepy big daddy long leg ones, and they’re trying to cuddle me, [laughs] and its great. I want them to cuddle me.Recording 17I still don’t have fucking wifi on this phone right now. I’m using….data…in the middle of I’m laying in bed. Comfortably, I could fall asleep at any time, just happily with my phone trying to internet, as kids do….just not on wifi. [laughing] why does this enrage me so much?I went to excruciating effort to rename thisD’s in the living room, and I don’t know who he’s talking to, and I really really wanna know, but I also really don’t wanna get up or care about anything other than how comfy I am.Recording 18I really like the liquid part. The part where I feel like I’m just…in liquid. That is very appealing. I just wish I was more warm. I’m gonna complain about being cold constantly. And the way my glasses feel on my head. No, those things aren’t worth complaining about actually, those things are fine.Recording 19I’m gonna take a break from making the recordings for a while. I realized that I’m safe from having to display them, cause, I’m in the other room of my laptop. And thats where I recorded the initial greeting, the introduction, so to speak. And uh, I just could not in good….good conscience, introduce something so poorly. There is already an introduction. I will leave it until I can comfortably access it. So…all of these recordings will follow that. I’m gonna just try to get warm now. I feel like this sounds really way more sad than it is. It should not sound sad cause I’m smiling and I’ve been smiling the whole time.((Right after taking the first tab I recorded a video, about a minute long, which I intended to send to AJ in the morning along with all my other data collected.))Love[sigh] There’s always like 2 degrees of separation from my intention and the finished product, so this is going to be, I guess the finished product. AJ. Hello. I’m making it for you. I fucking love you. That’s all. That’s literally all. oh…Recording 20I don’t know if I made note of it earlier. I know that I remarked it aloud to myself, and the universe, and anyone who was listening…[sigh] no. Uh…[sigh] man, talking is just…not easy. Ok. [laughing] Oh my god. I’m actually fucking full on deleting this one. This….this uh, this marks a milestone. No. I won’t delete it, cause then I’ll never know that I said I was gonna delete it. But know this: I felt at some point that it needed to be deleted. Ok. I’m, I’m finished.Recording 21What I meant to say is that it’s just literally impossible to have a bad time doing this. Whoever said you could have a bad trip is fucking retarded, and a liar, its…not possible. Everything is fantastic.((Famous last words anyone?))Recording 22With the exception of the fact that I am still really fucking cold and….just…be warmer!Recording 23I am going to enjoy listening to these later. This is a fact.Recording 24I was way more deeply affected by the jarring nature of the alarms than I thought…oh my god it’s really…I should not have made them. I have like….four more?!Recording 25All I wanted to say is that the physical effects are much stronger than anticipated.And this....this was the final recording I made before shit got weird. The next section of this report is what I wrote up the following day after coming down and reflecting. I never finished the story intially because I grew frustrated with my inability to properly convey what I experienced. I do remember it relatively well, and will try to summarize it now, 6 months after the fact.I have to say that my ultimate conclusion from the waking nightmare that was “my trip” was not surprising. Well, it was somewhat surprising in that I was incredibly impressed by the immense creative power of my brain. That is astonishing. What I mean is that if I was seeking an answer, the answer I got was that I understand myself and the things that are important to me.The world around me became immensely beautiful. It filled me with such astounding joy. I wanted so badly to tell AJ that I love him, that I really love him from the deepest and truest part of me. I remember saying that I wanted him to be there, but I really didn’t, not physically. I wanted us to be one, and I have no other way of explaining that. Perhaps the resistance to telling him, and the anxiety underlying the keeping of my secret was part of what led my happy dream to becoming a nightmare. I believe it was a combination of things, though.Once physical sensation became something completely foreign and alien, I started to inspect my body. I remember resisting thinking negative thoughts about it, but I couldn’t help it. I was advised to stay very hydrated (I understood why, later, because drinking water was fucking impossible) and my belly swelled painfully with the liquid inside it. I curled up under the covers because I was cold, and held myself. Because the nerve endings in my skin were not firing in a familiar manner, my body felt strange and different. When my fingertips ran over my buttocks and thighs, parts of my body that I know to be strong and lovely, the skin felt soft and melting, and my muscles fell away, atrophied and wilted.I thought about looking at them to confirm that they were still there, but I was afraid of what I’d find. I was afraid I’d see myself for who I really am, ugly, withered, sagging. This thought became reality and I could see myself without looking and it was truly horrible. I knew that I was merely dreaming, and allowed even the bad thoughts to come, because I was curious. I fell into a black hole in the bed, my body parts swelling and swirling into a spiral/pretzel type object. I was inside and outside at the same time. I saw my skin stretched and puffy, just a mass of fatty limbs, a completely inhuman form. I relaxed and thought “of course this is how you see yourself. Don’t be afraid, you knew all along.”When I relaxed more my body became pure color, shards of black, white, green, and blue, continually breaking and reforming into extremely intricate patterns. It was sort of beautiful, but in a different way from the happy colors from earlier in the evening. These shards were painful, and menacing in their speed. They did not ebb and flow, like the happy colors. They whipped and swirled like a storm.At this point I still was not truly scared. I was an observer. I knew what I was seeing and feeling was the pure representation of the negative feelings I have about my physical self. It was interesting. At some point the swirling storm settled, I returned to my bed, and I knew that I needed to get up. Mostly because I needed to pee, but also I felt that I should change my environment. I felt that I had been lying there for a few days.I remember turning over in bed, feeling the blanket slide over my skin, the mattress give way beneath me. It all felt so strange and different. There were holes everywhere, and everything that moved fluttered and skittered about. I had to move very slowly because sudden movement was guaranteed sensory overload. Pulling the blankets back was a true exercise in bravery. The gaps in sensation on my skin meant that the feeling of fabric dragging over flesh felt like the stabbing legs of giant insects walking over me. The erratic manner in which the blankets appeared to move added to this illusion. I felt extremely uncomfortable, and though I didn’t feel intensely bad, I felt that the time of happiness had ended.I walked across the floor, my bare feet on the wood felt like they were made of a shifting sort of swiss cheese. It occasionally gave way and my foot fell into nothingness, like when you think you’ve descended the last step on a staircase, but there is really one more. Somehow I did not lose my balance because of this, but I was very hesitant to touch anything. My phone was still in my hand, and I felt it so firmly and heavily in my fingers, as if it were fused to me. I went into the living room to tell D, and my phone recordings, one final message before descending into hell. “The physical effects are much stronger than anticipated”.I tried to record a new message. I wanted to say that I was starting to become afraid, that I was having a bad time, that I was unhappy. I couldn’t speak. I said “it won’t let me say bad things about it”. D asked what it was. In my head I answered “my trip”, but I couldn’t say it aloud. I dropped my phone onto the red leather chair, it sunk deeply into it, impossibly deeply, and became immersed in the leather, which more resembled a very thick paint. “I guess I’ll leave that there,” I thought to myself, somewhat amused.When I turned my attention to the restroom, a terror so absolute gripped me, I was completely immobilized. At this point I realized that my trip had personified itself, and he did not want me to communicate anything negative. He also wanted me to do certain things, and did so by making anything else impossible. I stared at the door to the bathroom. Tears welled up in my eyes. “D,” I said, “I need you to help me.”“Help you with what?”“I need to go to the bathroom.”“Ok, you need me to walk you there?”“I mean I need to pee, but not in there, it won’t let me,” I laughed at the absurdity of this statement. I tried to will myself to walk to the bathroom but my body just would not move. Forcing it caused immense feelings of fear and anxiety. I took a step in a different direction, which was fine. Fascinating, I thought to myself. At that point I knew what my trip wanted me to do, but I still denied it. I started to laugh hysterically. ((SIDE NOTE: as a child I was extremely phobic of bathrooms because of some traumatic experiences at a very young age. Bathrooms and urination have been a strange fixation in many ways throughout my entire life for probably a whole host of weird psychological reasons that I wont get into here, just know that they exist and I am aware of them)).“I can’t believe this,” I said. “I figured out the rules to this game a while ago. Lose yourself to the trip and everything is fine. Resist and face consequences.” I started to shake and bounce a lot because I had to pee so badly. I didn’t really want to do what I needed to do, but I couldn’t wait any longer. I asked D to come with me, and he accompanied me as I very easily walked to the front door.When I was outside, I knew that it was cold, but I couldn’t really feel it. Everything was covered in ice. “That frost isn’t really there, right?” I asked. D merely told me that it was, indeed, quite cold. I squatted on the front porch and pissed, hard, over the stairs. The relief was overwhelming. I felt mildly ridiculous but at the same time part of me knew why I needed to do that. It felt very meaningful.When I returned to inside, I grabbed my phone from the liquid chair, and laid on the couch. My body felt better, and I felt better. My skin was still falling away in pieces, and it was very hard to move without a lot of discomfort. My arm against the back of the couch felt like it was made of hornets nest. Pieces of reality fell away, leaving a honeycomb type pattern. A fly buzzed around my head. I felt repulsed yet fascinated. What is my brain doing? I wondered to myself.My nightmare only became truly scary when D decided to go to the store. I was already somewhat uncomfortable with his presence, but I also did not want to be alone. He said he would be right back. Once alone I remembered the rules. Give in to the trip and he will take you for a ride. Don’t resist. I buried myself in blankets and closed my eyes to enter a world of Gigeresque horror. My world was a liquid gray and green, melting into black void. The black void took the shape of holes, which stretched the gray and green goo into thin lines between them. A vast network as far as my eyes could see, if it was my eyes that were seeing. This network zoomed away from me and I realized I was looking closely at the eyes of an enormous insect, the size of a universe. It’s face was incredibly detailed, and slightly glowing, as if it were an image on an old computer screen. My skin was the insect, and the insect was me. Bright green lasers crisscrossed the void, forming patterns. I was so cold. I was under piles pf blankets but I could not feel them. “How can I warm my flesh when my flesh is not real?” I thought. I battled with succumbing to the feeling, the imagery, I wanted out. It had been years and D was still gone. Maybe he was not coming back. The silence of the house felt oppressive, rather than peaceful. I felt deep loneliness.I turned and picked up my phone. It stretched and contorted in my hand. I struggled to read it, or even hold it. The lock screen displayed a notification. “AJ replayed your snap”. Suddenly struggling to swim back into reality, my mind raced for a memory. What had I sent? I don’t remember talking to him. I opened the app, the snap was replayed 19 minutes ago. What have I done? Let me apologize, I pleaded with my trip. Let me make it okay. I don’t want him to be scared, he can’t know that I am scared. I am strong and I am fine.I tapped his name but nothing happened. The letters were just pushed out of the way. No! I thought, why won’t you let me? I fiddled with the other functions of my phone, which was now trapezoidal in shape and a foot long. The screen was all gray and would not display color. I returned to snapchat. It was frozen. My trip won’t let me talk to AJ. But maybe I had? My eyes bored into the text that read “19m ago”. Hadn’t minutes passed? What was happening?D returned. His presence in the house was overwhelming. I silently sat with my anxiety. He laid on the floor eating chocolate. I didn’t want to look at him. I wanted him to leave, I wanted someone else there. Someone who was safer. I was not sure that the person who had come into the house was really D at all.I checked my phone again. “AJ replayed your snap 26m ago”. So time was really passing, apparently. I tapped his name and nothing happened. I tapped another name and a chat window opened. I don’t want to talk to T, I thought, I don’t want to bother him. Returning to the home screen I tapped AJs name, and still nothing happened. His name swelled to a much larger size on the screen. I was frustrated. I knew I wasn’t going to send him anything, I just wanted my phone to work. My phone working means things are real, this was not real, and I became extremely afraid.I suddenly realized that D had been chewing on food for an incredibly long time. I could see him, hunched over, out of the corner of my eye. Just constantly eating, so fast, so viciously. I was disgusted.“I want M,” I said. “Help me call M.”“Why would I help you?” D asked accusingly. I looked at him, and his face was that of a demon. His eyes hollow holes of glowing white. Black ink flowed from the sockets. I looked away. That’s not real. Fuck that can’t be real.“please, I can’t make my phone work, call M for me.”He took my phone and said “Is this person EXPECTING you to call them?”. I felt very personally attacked and wracked with guilt after this question.I hesitantly said yes, even though that was not exactly true. I found M's contact page and he helped me put it on speaker. I listened to it ring for an incredible time, and then it went to voicemail.“Call again,” I pleaded, feeling panic.“Are you sure you’re not bothering them?” D asked, in a very mocking tone.Yes…I thought…I am bothering her….but I need something to be real…and we called again. No answer.I thought of who else I could call, but my phone was frozen on her contact info. My trip wants me to contact M, and no one else. But she was not there. I struggled to operate my phone. I got to my contacts list and scrolled through it. None of the names would work except for M's. Fuck.I opened snapchat again. “AJ replayed your snap 34m ago”. Fuck.I opened my contacts. Scrolling, scrolling, frozen, M. Open. Send text message. Fuck I can’t type. Go back. Scrolling. M. Go back. Scrolling. Frozen. This went on for almost an hour. Finally something clicked and I remembered how to make technology work. “Siri, tell M: ‘I need you.’” Message sent.Snapchat. “AJ replayed your snap 34m ago”. No...almost an hour has gone by. At least half an hour, but not even a minute has passed?This is a nightmare, I told myself, and I will wake up. I just have to watch it play out. Yes.And what a nightmare it was. Here is where I am picking up the retelling 6 months later. Eventually D asked if I wanted him to leave. Maybe he picked up on the fact that I was extremely distrusting of him. I told him that was fine, that I was just going to ride this out by myself, maybe I'd get a hold of someone else. I was honestly terrified of being alone, but I was MORE scared with him there. I probably looked relatively fine, I'd just been bundled up on the couch not doing much but messing with my phone and internally panicking for quite a while.At this point D had not ever done acid before, so I don't think he really knew how to take care of me at all, not to mention he was tripping on shrooms as well. D had not ever done acid before, so I don't think he really knew how to take care of me at all, not to mention he was tripping on shrooms as well. When he left I felt a sense of relief but I also felt utterly incredibly alone and scared.I knew that I was just on a drug, and that it would wear off and everything would be fine. I knew that everything I was thinking and feeling and fearing were my thoughts and maybe I had the power to turn it around. I came to the conclusion rather quickly that I lacked the fortitude to turn it around, and began to really feel pure dread.I didn't want to talk to AJ. I don't even know what I was thinking about that. I kept trying to come up with some reason that he'd replayed a snapchat when I didn't think I'd sent him one for hours. I was very afraid that I had sent him something recently without remembering it, and that it would clue him in to the fact that I was tripping. Time was passing so slowly that even the idea of waiting out the trip seemed agonizing and impossible.I wanted to cry. I ended up calling a lot of people, but no one answered, probably because it was 1am on a Tuesday. Finally I got a hold of someone, a fellow psychonaut, the friend who had sold me the drug. He was awake. He lived about an hour away, but I convinced him I was wigging out bad and needed company. He agreed to come but a deep paranoia had gripped me. Everything he said carried a similar mocking tone, the one I perceived D as speaking to me in earlier. I realized that I must be imagining it, but this led me to wonder what else I was imagining. Maybe I was imagining this phone call. I got up from the couch. Moving around was still difficult but I was desperate to get a grip on reality. Still on the phone with my friend, trying to make casual conversation and seem like my normal self again, I paced around the house. I insisted that my friend stay on the phone with me, consumed with the idea that if I hung up the phone, it would be revealed that it was all in my head, that I never called anyone, that I was alone and fucked up forever. I kept obsessively asking him where he was. Very familiar with the route between his town and mine, I checked his information against the time. I was suspicious that he was still at home, in his bed, just laughing at me.He suggested that I drink some water. There was a glass sitting on the table that I had poured for myself hours ago. I sat down in front of it and stared at it the way a chess grandmaster stares at his chessboard, contemplating his next move. Drinking water seemed like a monumental and impossible task. For some reason the idea of drinking water frightened me. I reached out and touched the glass, but I never got farther than that, choosing to get up and walk away instead.I still find it odd how I continued to be afraid of drinking the water. I kept going back and forth between determination to do 'normal' things, and exercising willpower, and wanting to just stop giving a fuck. But I was worried that I was brain damaged somehow, that I'd done something very wrong, that my relationship with AJ would be ruined and he would be devastated. A part of me was very aware that these were somewhat valid emotions and I couldn't help feeling them as intensely real because of the drug. After all, earlier in the evening I had experienced pure joy in a similar manner. This was of course, much less tolerable.My friend had apparently gotten lost on the way, taken a wrong highway exit, and wanted to get off the phone so he could use his GPS. I was utterly convinced that this was some kind of trick. I still was not sure I hadn't dreamed up this entire phone conversation. I 'knew' that if I hung up I would wake up from some stupor having not called anyone at all, still alone, still psychotic. I begged with him, practically crying, to stay on the line.Thankfully blessed with a very good sense of direction and knowledge of local geography, I was able to navigate him to the house. I had opened the front door at some point, to get some fresh air. The door opened to a semi closed off porch, so I couldn't really see the street from inside the house. He told me that he had arrived and was parking. I could hear the sound of an engine running outside, and then a car door opening and closing. A sense of relief like no other washed over me. The room seemed brighter, I was smiling.'See you in a second,' I said, and hung up the phone.Black.Silent.Grey clouds filled my vision, and everything looked like a typical haunted house. 'No! No! No!' I screamed inside my head. How could I be so stupid as to hang up the phone? But no, hanging up the phone did not suddenly cause him to blip out of existence. He was never there. My consciousness had given me hope, built up over the course of an hour (which felt like eternity on Acid Time), just to take it away. To punish me. I needed to be punished because I am a bad person who lies and and is lazy and hypocritical.Some part of me still knew that everything that was happening was just being created by my own mind, and that I clearly had some fucking issues with self esteem I needed to sort out. I just needed to wait for the drug to wear off. This didn't really calm me much though, because minutes felt like hours, and I had, by my estimation, at least 4 more hours of this to endure completely alone.I started to cry. And then...I heard something. Footsteps.J had arrived after all. Only seconds had passed, my mind slowed them down to an eternity of agony. But there he was, his usual goofy self. We sat on the couch together and I tried to explain everything that had been happening. Quite poorly, I imagine. I still felt as if everything he said was dripping with sarcasm, derision, and disgust. This actually comforted me somewhat because I figured this was me projecting my insecurities in a very extreme way because of how the drug was making me feel emotions. I just kept telling myself he was talking normally and I was reading this tone into it.What ended up saving me, because I was still paranoid that none of this was actually happening, but that I was making up my own personal hell because I felt like I deserved it, was watching a youtube video. J and I are both fans of this one movie review channel, where they do reviews that are about an hour long. One had just been released the day before and I watched it then. At least, I started watching it, but got distracted and did other things while it played in the background.Seeing the familiar first 15 minutes of that video, followed by snippets of of the vaguely familiar and snippets of the unknown, was immensely reassuring to me. I felt that there was no way I could keep up hallucinating this entire video with such accuracy. It had to be real. J was really there, I was really fine, I wasn't eternally in my own personal hell. When the sun came up about an hour and a half later, J decided to go home, because he had other obligations. I was coming down, and watching the sunrise was like being fucking reborn. Alone in the house as it filled with light, I settled into a chair and felt extremely satisfied with myself, like I had just exorcised a demon from me. I took a selfie. My hair was disheveled and my pupils were dilated. I sent it to my best friend with the caption 'Dragon Slayer'.And I really felt that way. I reflected on everything that I had felt and thought over the past several hours, and it all made profound sense to me. I vowed to love myself a little more, doubt myself a little less, and to appreciate the people I care about. None of the paranoia or bad feelings persisted. I vowed to love myself a little more, doubt myself a little less, and to appreciate the people I care about. None of the paranoia or bad feelings persisted. They were part of me that were always there, and I looked at them in a microscope for a while, and accepted them.I ended up talking to my dad that morning. We have a very special bond, but we are not very affectionate. I went disc golfing with him, and it was honestly one of the most beautiful things ever. It was still early morning, everything was covered in dew. It being late spring there was maximum green and flowers everywhere. I was definitely still a little high at that point, feeling familiar feelings of contendedness and a strange good energy. After our game I told my dad I loved him for the first time in probably 20 years. I told him that he was a good father and I hoped he understood how much I appreciate him.He seemed surprised but happy. I was too. It wasn't until around T+20h that I was confident all the effects of the drug had ended. I did continue to find myself in a somewhat different mindset for the next week or so, though. Very positive, reflective, and accepting.((SIDE NOTE: When I told AJ about what I had done he FLIPPED HIS SHIT. We almost broke up over it. Apparently my anxieties were somewhat well-founded. He came around eventually and has since tripped himself, afterwards apologizing to me profusely for not trusting my judgement and for being so judgmental himself of a beautiful experience.))((ADDITIONAL SIDE NOTE: I am assuming that my dosage was around 200ug, not exactly an advisable beginner dose, though not exactly a hero dose either. From my conversations with friends and reading various trip reports online I've found that by and large the level of visuals and dissociation I experienced were more on par with 350+ doses. Like I said in my opening, I don't use drugs of any sort very often. I was raised atheist but have always had a spiritual side to me from a very young age and would wander off into the woods by myself and meditate, often achieving a state of waking dream which I found very enjoyable. I also suffer from some moderate mental illness (Bi-Polar Disorder, Body Dysmorphic Disorder), as well as a type of migraine known as kaleidoscopic vision. A lot of the visuals I saw in my trip were actually things I have seen before, completely sober, since long before I ever touched or heard of psychedelics. It is my suspicion that because of the way my brain works, I was already very 'primed' for a psychedelic experience. 4 friends of mine have taken similar or higher doses from the same batch and got nowhere near the level I did.))Exp Year: 2017ExpID: 111357Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 29 Published: Aug 16, 2018Views: 2,019    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Guides / Sitters (39), Bad Trips (6), First Times (2), General (1) DOSE: T+ 0:00100-150 ugoralLSD(liquid)  T+ 4:0050 ugoralMDMA(powder / crystals)  T+ 8:0020-30 mgsmokedMitragynine BODY WEIGHT:200 lbMitragynine is know to have antagonistic properties at the 5ht2 receptor.

One drop each of what was reputed to be "Pharmaceutical grade Sandoz LSD smuggled in from Europe". Anyway, about 4hrs in we split 100mg of rather pure mdma crystals. At about 8hrs I was really feeling ready to sleep. So I decide it was time to kill the trip as I had in the past with some purified kratom alkaloid (97% mytragynine alkaloid extract). Upon smoking it I felt a distinct boost to the trip. I decided that was enough and went to bed. The most intense closed eye visuals of my life set in! *Vivid* dream like moving scenes of color and activity.

I had never done mushrooms before and I heard of some very good ones that a friend of a friend had. After I got mushrooms I knew that I wanted to do a full cut for my first experience. On the 4th, I met up with two friends who were also going to trip with me. They had done mushrooms before I had not. Anyone I asked how much I should do my first time suggested I did not do the full cut I had planned on doing. But I was stubborn and did not know what they were like and thought I could handle it. Anyone I asked how much I should do my first time suggested I did not do the full cut I had planned on doing. But I was stubborn and did not know what they were like and thought I could handle it. It was a very hot day. I’d say it was around 85 to 90 degrees outside. We met up at a park near my house after I got off work. It was about 1 p.m. and I was ready to get my trip started. Between me and my two friends we had psybocilin, lsd, mdma(molly), and marijuana. We all ate our mushrooms in our respectable doses, mine of course being a cut or 3.5 grams. Also when I got the mushrooms I picked out a huge cap which weighed to be about 2.4 of my 3.5 gram cut. I ate it all. We then moved to a different spot and as we walked I suggested we go all out and do everything we had. I bartered with my friend to give me two doses of molly and intern I would give him and our other friend some acid.About 20 minutes a dropped a hit of acid on my tongue then 5 minutes after that I ate two doses of pure molly crystal out of the bag it was in. I wanted to walk somewhere to buy a bottle of water so I did not get dehydrated on such a hot day. We walked to a gas station and I bought a liter of water. From there we decided we wanted to smoke a bowl. So we went back in the woods to smoke. We found a secluded area with a huge log on the ground that provided us with seats to sit there and smoke and relax.I just realized as I write this I begin to feel anxious and sick to my stomach. I think bringing the memories back from this day is causing the anxiety.We sat there and smoked as I played music from my phone. This spot in the woods is where I first started to feel myself coming up. There was trash and leaves on the ground and these things began to light up. Not at once, certain sections of debree would slowly light then fade as a different section would do the same. The ground was waving in front of me. I then began to lose track of how I got to where I was and how to get out of the area I was in. I was not worried at this point because my trip was very enjoyable. But we sat there for a while (personally too long for me) and I was ready to get up and go somewhere else and do something. But they did not want to go and I did not know where to go, so I sat there with them readily awaiting for them to be ready to move on. This is where my trip lost enjoyment. I soon began to feel uncomfortable sitting in the heat, in the woods, on a log. So I moved from the log to the dirt on the ground. I did not care about getting dirty I just cared about comfort.  I was hot and slightly nautious. Soon my one friend who was also tripping that said something that disturbed me.“Imagine what it would feel like to kill someone.”I sat there in silence but in my head I was saying “ok, I’ve had enough, I’m leaving”.Five minutes later I stood up and made my departure announced. I said I was going home. I was too hot and too fucked up to be here in the woods doing nothing. So I started to walk home. They walked out of the woods with me but after that I went one way and they went another. I got to a main road near my house and immediately felt as if everyone was looking at me. I felt like I was covered in dirt from laying in the woods. I felt everyone’s eyes on me and that somehow they knew what I was on. I now did not want to go home. I called my friends to see where they were but they did not answer. From there a paced a quarter mile trying to find them but I felt too uncomfortable in mid day walking near my home tripping, feeling like everyone knew and everyone as watching, so I made my way home.By the time I had gotten home my trip had intensified, which I did not see happening. I thought I was peaking in the woods but I could not have been more wrong. Time was hard for me to keep track of but I estimate I got home approximately 1 hour after I had ingested everything. I went into my house and there was no one else home. I immediately flung open the door to my room and ripped all my clothes off from feeling hot and dirty. I got in the shower because I thought it would make me feel better because at this time my trip had gone from undesirable to extreme discomfort. I felt more uncomfortable then I had ever felt in my live. The best way to describe it is I felt as if my skeleton has rotated lightly inside my skin and I just was not fitting right inside myself. Every movement I made was the wrong one. I felt like screaming from discomfort. Keep in mind, this is the hardest I had ever tripped at this point. What I was seeing and hearing was distorted. Walking was harder then usual and the mental trip was taking me to a level I never could have wanted to imagine.I have tripped on acid several times before but the most I had ever done at once was 3 hits. I was nowhere near experienced for everything I did that day.Soon after I got in the shower and cooled of I became extremely enraged because the shower did nothing to ease my discomfort. As soon as I got cooled off I felt even more uncomfortable. I quickly got out of the shower and dried off. I stopped at the bathroom mirror to see what I looked like. I did not even see myself as I had known myself. Instead I saw a body that had something inside of it. Because my pupils were so dilated my eyes looked as if they were all black. I had remembered a movie where a girl who was possessed by a demon had eyes that looked exactly like mine and this led me to think, is there something inside me?I ran into my room to try and lay down and listen to music, making one last desperate attempt to make the trip enjoyable, but nothing worked. A few emotions I felt while tripping: anger, discomfort, fear, confusion, rage, discomfort, and paranoia. Laying in my bed listening to music was what I always did to make my unpleasant trips enjoyable. But it was not working this time. Just as everything felt uncomfortable, all the music I tried to listen to was the wrong choice. I became more frustrated and enraged which eventually led to psychotic thoughts.“Why won’t anything sound good?”“Why can’t I get comfortable?”“Why am I so alone?”“Why am I so itchy?”“Is something on me?”“Where is everyone?”“Is someone home?”Those thoughts repeated in my head for what felt like a few hours but in reality was approximately 3 to 5 minutes. I was laying in my bed trying to think of what to do. I did not want to be tripping but I knew it was beyond my control. The worst part was that it was not even 2 hours since I had taken everything and I knew I had a long ride ahead of me. I could not handle it at this point. I got up to take another shower, I don’t even know why, I guess at the time I thought it could help, but it didn’t. the second shower only lasted about 30 seconds until a ripped open the shower curtain and ran into my room naked. I felt so confined inside my room but I knew if I went outside I would feel exposed and this caused even more frustration knowing that there was nowhere to be that would make this better. The walls and the floors were moving. I was cold and hot, weak and strong. I was losing my grip on reality. Every trip I’ve ever had the thought “Is this ever going to end” has crossed my mind, but this time I was convinced that the trip was never going to end, even worse, that I was not going to get through this day to see tomorrow.The next 30 minutes of my life felt like hours. And when I say hours I mean HOURS. I thought I was in my room for 6 to 7 hours tripping. The time after the second shower consisted of me going to all the rooms in my house over and over again looking for some kind of enjoyment. Every time nothing was found, I became even more enraged, scared and desperate. This was it, I gave up. I layed down in my bed. I was convinced I was dying. I called my friend who was experienced with these types of drugs and asked him if what I had taken was killing me. My hearing was so distorted that I could barely make out what he was saying so I just kept asking questions after questions without hearing the response. I very vividly remember asking him if I needed medical attention. His response came to me distorted. What he really said was no I don’t think you need to call an ambulance. But in my head what I heard and invisioned was, in a panicked voice: “Ok… um I think im going to call an ambulance for you, don’t worry they’ll be there soon.” It was only about a second from the time he said that till he spoke again but in that second was the start of my death. I heard that and immediately closed my eyes and saw ambulances lined up in front of my house, with paramedics walking into my room to find my dead, deformed body, laying a puddles of my own piss and vomit. That 1 second did not even feel like time. I was outside of time at this point. I was no longer in reality. I was somewhere else. That 1 second did not even feel like time. I was outside of time at this point. I was no longer in reality. I was somewhere else. I continued the phone conversation for a little after my friend repeatedly reassured me that I was not dying and was going to be perfectly fine and that I was just tripping really hard. But I did not trust him or anyone else. I was convinced that no one understood what was happening and that I was dying.After the phone conversation I laid in my bed starring straight ahead. I had remembered something my friend once said about people getting so freaked out when tripping that their face droops to the side and they have a heart attack.  I felt my face and it felt sideways. I got up to look in the mirror and it looked like the left side of my face was drooping. I tried to concentrate really hard to see if it really was or if I was just freaking out. But it did not matter. Either way I was dying. And after I looked in the mirror and couldn’t see what I wanted, I was convinced I was also going blind. One final time I laid down in my bed convinced I was blond and dying and I wanted to cry, but I couldn’t. My eyes started leaking. I don’t mean I was crying, I mean liquid started flowing out of my eyes and I couldn’t stop it and had no idea why it was happening. My first thought was that I had drunk too much water and gave myself water poison. I now had 3 different things that I thought were causing my death. Now in my bed, it happened. I was lying there with my eyes wide open but I was not seeing reality. Instead I saw the scene of my death as it was about to happen. I saw police and ambulances in front of my house. I saw the police tearing my room apart finding drugs everywhere. I saw my mother in my room looking at me in disgust, lying there dead in puddle of my own piss and vomit and being ashamed to call herself my mother. I see her shed not one tear. I saw myself. I saw my dead body lying there, motionless and white. I saw all this from what I can only explain as 5 or 6 feet above my body. But I could also see outside in front of my house from the same position. Its hard to explain and even harder to understand. But at this point in time I was dead and was not coming back. I was outside of my body watching the last moments of my life and the first few minutes of my death.Then out of no where I was back in my body again looking straight ahead., the fan in my window still blowing and my room still  a mess from me tearing it apart. I know felt the biggest sense of euphoria I had ever felt. The rest of the day was my comedown and I was not normal again after I slept that night. But the rest of the day(remember was the 4th of July) I spent telling my friends about my experience and trying to get insight on it. But no one had any words of comfort to say. I knew that part of me died that day.It has been10 days today since that happened and I think about it every day. Some day’s it gets me so worked up that I still want to cry like I did that day. It was the most traumatic event of my life.  I have not felt the same since that day and in a way I am convinced I died that day and was reborn a different person.Since that day my anxiety and sadness have become worse even just smoking marijuana now is not as enjoyable as it used to be. I am also much more paranoid and untrusting of people. I feel like I’m trapped inside my body. I am hoping someday this will all go away.Exp Year: 2010ExpID: 86375Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 19 Published: Sep 3, 2018Views: 3,512    Mushrooms (39), LSD (2), MDMA (3) : First Times (2), Combinations (3), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Depression (15), Hangover / Days After (46), Post Trip Problems (8), Various (28) DOSE:  oralCannabis(edible / food) 1 tabletoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:165 lbIt was late July and a couple of my friends and myself were on our way to see a concert not far from our hometown. It was extremely hot out that day and seemed like it would be the perfect day to see an outdoor concert. To make the situation even better, I received some tickets for the event that morning completely out of the blue. Prior to that I thought that I was going to have to buy from a scalper.I've seen a number of concerts at the venue that we were going to, so I knew what to expect. Before the concert starts, tons of people hang out in the parking lot and drink, grill, sell food, walk around etc. The type of music that we were going to listen to also basically turns the parking lot into a pharmacy; drugs are being sold everywhere and people are using drugs everywhere. My friends and I knew this and planned on ingesting some mind altering substances upon our arrival. When we arrived at the venue we walked around for a little and sat under some trees to cool down because it was so hot out. A bunch of our other friends drove down separately and they joined us as we sat and cooled down. We had about two hours or so before the concert so the plan was to relax, eat some LSD, and get ready for a great night. If I recall correctly, everyone in our group including myself had several experiences with LSD. I'd taken acid approximately ten times up to that point and every experience was wonderful. I had a few instances in previous experiences where I would get a little paranoid, but nothing I would call a bad trip. On one occasion (coincidentally at the same venue) I had to undergo a sobriety test during the peak of my trip. I was escorted to a police trailer along with a friend and a couple of other people we didn't know. Even though it was a very stressful situation being taken away from my friends by cops while I'm well into an acid trip, and I was quite paranoid, I held myself together and performed the sobriety test perfectly. The only thing that the officers said was peculiar was that my pupils very large (so large that they exceeded the largest diameter pupil measuring device) and that there was a 'relapse' or something when light was shined in my eyes. Although this is another story, I thought I'd mention it because I believed if I could go through that experience I could go through any. I knew LSD was very powerful drug, but I didn't realize how powerful until that day in June. With a number of experiences under my belt, I believed I knew what it was about and what to expect. So here I am sitting in this field with bunch of my friends under a tree, and one of my friends that joined us had just baked a fresh batch of cannabis brownies. I received a brownie and ate it quickly. The concert was scheduled to start at 7:30 and I ate the brownie at about 4:00-4:30. Having eaten cannabis a number of times before, I knew I would be feeling the brownie before I went into the concert.Right before the cannabis brownie started to take effect, I took one dose of white paper acid. With two doses, the plan was to take one and then take the other in the show when the effects from the first began to wear off. I have taken up to eight hits in one sitting, so I thought one would be nothing to worry about. I  couldn't have been more wrong. As the effects of the brownie started to settle in (about a half an hour after I ate it), I started becoming paranoid. It had been a while since I had last eaten cannabis, so I didn't remember how strong its effects can be. The combination of the heat and the unsettling feeling that I had from the brownie was making me uncomfortable. I felt tired, paranoid, fidgety, and very anxious. The friends that joined me had also ingested some acid at this point and everyone was kind of silent as we waited for it to take its course. We decided to return to my friends car and lock up our belongings so we wouldn't need to worry about it later. Sitting in the car is the last thing I can remember before things started getting out of hand. The first thing that I remember bothering me was the intense heat. I must have been at least 95 degrees that day so I felt like I was melting. Now, I don't know if I was just destined to have a bad experience that day, but I think the heat and the brownie had something to do with it. In any case, I was in a delicate situation. I then made the worst mistake I think one can make while taking LSD or any psychedelic: I forgot that I took the LSD. It was at this point that I was in for the most terrifying experience I've ever had in my entire life. The bad experience lasted for about two hours, but it seemed like a million lifetimes. While most of my memories of it are blurry, there were some very vivid moments that I don't believe I can ever forget. As the acid took effect, I became extremely confused and I didn't want to be in that parking lot. The two friends that I was with were just starting feel the effects of their LSD as I stumbled around aimlessly and they followed me. They noticed that I was having some trouble after they tried to get me to follow them to our other friends but I refused. I feared that my two friends had turned against me and were bringing me to the police who would then search me and throw me in jail for the rest of my life because I had more acid in my pocket. There was a small hill in the field and behind it was supposedly where our friends were. Every time that I would finally give in and start to follow them I would envision the police waiting for me on the other side to take me away. I'm not quite sure if the order of the next sequence of events is correct, but as we were walking around I noticed words from conversations that people were having were meshing together into offensive sentences in my head. All that I heard were people's voices taunting me and making fun of me. I believed that everything I was experiencing was real life as I forgot that I ate LSD. People's faces were terrifying me as they melted and twisted around. I thought I had done something terrible and I was about to be given some sort of trial to see if I would be thrown into hell for eternity. I am not a very religious person, I'm agnostic, so what happened next really freaked me out. For some reason I knew that everything I thought was true. I could see into the future and it was horrifying. The scariest part of my trip was when god and the devil became involved. I realized that all of the horrible things that I was hearing actually was god speaking to me telepathically. One of my friends then said something to me, I don't remember what it was because I was in such fear that god had actually stopped time and begun talking to me through my friends body. He told me something along the lines of that I was a failure and I was damned for eternity. I then believed that I was the anti-christ and that all of the horrible things that were happening to me were all planned my whole life. I saw hints everywhere that I was the devil and I was crushed by it. I could see nothing but horrible things happening to me. At probably the worst part of the trip I asked my friend if I was the anti-chirst. They laughed at me because of how ridiculous the statement was and I perceived their laughter as negative. I thought that they knew very well that I was indeed the anti-christ and they were going to lead me to where I would be killed by god himself. I eventually forgot that I thought I was the anti-christ and as we finally reached the hill that we were trying to get to earlier (I was with other friends at this time as the other ones decided to let someone else deal with me). On the other side, my thoughts from before about bad things on the other side of the hill were somewhat true. Two of my friends were being searched by policemen right upon my arrival and I thought the whole parking lot just got busted and we were all screwed forever. I very slowly began to come back to my senses in short increments. I actually experienced some of the most vivid and extraordinary hallucinations I've ever experienced during this period in the trip. I had become so used to the bad trip I guess that I didn't really even care anymore and I started to think positively at times. Finally I sat down in a chair and I remember thinking that I could just blast off from the Earth and go anywhere. I closed my eyes and saw the most unbelievable fractals and geometric designs I've ever seen. It was like I was painting in the backs of my eyelids. I felt a great deal of creativity. But the bad side wasn't over yet. I was still very confused as I floated along with my friends' faces in the air. All of our heads were flying together (bodies were not there) which was cool but frightening at the same time. One friend had mirror sunglasses on that I thought contained another world of some sort. At this point in my experience, it was time to go into the concert. As we waited outside the entry gates for our other friends it hit me that I had just had a horrible trip, and I didn't even realize it until then. Though I was still hallucinating for several hours, I pulled myself out of it after indulging in two hours of complete chaos and hell. I confirmed with one of my friends that I just 'freaked out' and was completely stunned as to how it happened. I was fine the rest of the trip, but I felt very strange and couldn't stop thinking about why it happened.I took a break from doing LSD for a while and I've only done it one time since my bad experience. My last experience was wonderful, but I don't know if I'll ever do it again. I wanted to end my experiences on a good note. But I've now realized just how powerful LSD really is. I only took one hit and one brownie and I was done for. I'm thankful that I didn't eat anymore that day because it could've been 100 times worse.Exp Year: 2009ExpID: 82764Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 20 Published: Sep 12, 2018Views: 2,956    LSD (2), Cannabis (1) : General (1), Combinations (3), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Festival / Lg.

I really enjoyed meth a lot, but feel I got lucky the first time and didn't get addicted Addy: not my favorite thing in the world as I took 2 30mg er's and was up for 2 days in a row Alcholo: not bad, Can be enjoyable, but I would prefer to stay sober if anything. Air duster: my most favorite thing in the world. Nothing compares to airduster in my mind. Pot: used to be a heavy smoker, but it's just not worth it anymore Kratom: I also love kratom as it mimics opiates for me and I can not do any 'real' drugs per say Xanax: I used to really enjoy Xanax, the mentally calming effect it had, the carelessness, but I grew to hate it because of the stupid decisions I would make when I'm barred out. (Huffed gas)Gas: didn't really effect me, felt like a weak air duster, so I didn't enjoy it. With that out of the way, I would like to say I am some what an experienced tripper. I used to kind of sell acid, and was tripping about every other day. Basically when I took acid, I was trying to force a spiritual experience, see crazy shit, etc. I never really respected her. I loved the intensity of it which is why I always went for the higher than 'normal' dosages. So let's get into the story that scarred me, and made me never ever wanna drop acid again! Me and the lady couldn't really do drugs out of fear of getting tested, so we resulted to drugs that didn't stay long in your system: Molly and acid, basically.One night we had planned to trip with our friend out of town. We had planned it basically a week or two in advanced, our friend was gonna drop two and our plan was to drop 5, but ended up doing 8. Most of the acid I got was pure, never the fake synthetic shit, I wasn't about that. All of my acid had been on blotter paper, whether it had art on it, or just white on white. This acid we got, we were told it was a little weaker than the last batch, so that's when we decided to take 8. We had a total of 20 tabs, 16 of them were mine and the ladies, 4 was the homies. So we get to our friends house, about 40 mins away and right as we got there dropped the tabs. I didn't really keep track of time, but I will guesstimate when everything happened. T:4:20 p.m.- 8 tabs on mine and my ladies tounge, friend did not drop his yet because wasn't sure if he wanted to trip or not. The acid had no taste, other than the cardboard it was on. The guy I got it from drew on the hit sizes.T:4:40- lady tells me she is already getting pretty heavy visuals and is feeling quite off, she's acting kind of distant, but we can both be quote shy at some times, so I thought it was that. It did strike me as odd that she was already getting heavy visuals, but we both didn't eat anything the whole day for this reason, and this was the most acid shes eaten so I didn't think that much of it. (I wish I had. Looking back now, there was so many warning signs of her having a bad trip)T 5:30 p.m. I'm starting to slightly come up and our friend, my lady and I had just gotten back from the gas station (our friend drove) and we had gotten some smokes, me and my lady chain smoke like crazy on acid. For me it kinda levels me and keeps me connected to the world. So we're walking through the woods behind my homies house and everynow and then my lady says the phrase *it happened again*, I didn't think to much of it (I wish I had, like I said, so many warning signs of a bad trip was coming) I'm starting to get enhanced vision, H.D. Vision, as I call it and the lady said, the next day, that she was tripping harder than ever at that point, she said it looked like the grass was coming off the ground, and everything looked very cartoonist T:6 p.m.- were out of the woods now and I can feel the acid in full effect. It was hitting me very hard at this point, I was seeing intense tracers, depth perception was fucked, and some very beautiful patterns all over the ground. The friend asked us '1-10 how hard are you tripping?' And instantly the lady said '10' which really struck me as odd cause I was just now starting to come up and she was saying she's full blown tripping. Some time passes, we watched the Simpson's Halloween special, very hilliarious on acid, we were all enjoying our self, but I could not shake the feeling that something was off. The movie ended and we were all a little hungry, so we went down stairs to see what there was, nothing really looked appealing so we just got water. The lady was acting very different, she just seemed so disconnected from everything around her. I shook it off, thinking it's just the large amount of acid we'd done, and her being kinda shy around newish people (our friend) We go back to my friends room, and start playing some dead rising. It was very difficult to play, I was tripping really hard, but not getting very much visuals, more just a 'mind trip', I guess you could say. The lady was seeming reaalllyyy disconnected from the world at this point. She kept saying 'I wanna play a game', and we'd hand her the controller and she wouldn't really do much, so shed hand it back and then a couple minutes later 'I wanna play a game'.Eventually, it was just my friend playing a game and I was on social media on my phone and just talking to my friend and the lady everynow and then, but the lady kept saying 'it happened again over and over, about 5 minutes in between each other I estimate.I started to think, maybe I'm doing something that I do not realize, and she doesn't like it. I wish that were the case.So we go downstairs cause we wanted to smoke, just me and the lady, our friend was doing something I don't remember and he didn't wanna get up. We're on the porch of my friends house and smoking a cig, and I ask my lady 'are you okay? You seem kind of off' and all she says is 'yeah' we keep smoking our stoggy, and I remember looking out onto his front yard (his house is on a decent sized bit of land), and it was dark by this time, and all I could see was fractals, patterns and colors. I had never experienced this before and it kinda threw me off and freaked me out, but I held it together and just focused on something else. I told the lady, 'this Is kind of getting really intense and I just want it to stop, but I also don't want it to stop', this was maybe the 3 hour mark of our trip, so we hadn't even hit our peak yet. The lady agreed with me, but still something seemed so off with her.We go back inside and bull shit around with our homie, and he tells was about an hour prior, he had dropped 2 of his tabs, and that made us happy. I loved getting fucked up with friends.About 30 minutes to an hour pass, and we go back down stairs to go out side and mess around in his big garage, and smoke cigs and he was gonna smoke some pot.He goes down stairs and goes outside, but when my lady started down the stairs, she fell flat on her back and slid all the way down the stairs, it was kind of comical how she slid down them, but it was the love of my life, so I didn't find it all that funny. I made sure she was okay and asked again If she was okay (mentally) and she said 'okay' or 'I think' so this whole time were still trying to get outside my lady was becoming more and more disconnected from reality. We were all standing around talking, she was against the wall and just collapsed for some reason (she didn't pass out or anything, just lost her footing I guess). When she stood up, the look in her eyes was very odd, it was pure embarrassment, mixed with 'why tf did I just do that, is everything okay?' It kinda broke my heart, that look in her eye because she wanted to make a good impression on my friends and be 'cool' and didn't wanna make a fool of her self. She can be very self conscious sometimes, but she has kind of grew outta that and also all my friends love to chill with her and I, so this night did not ruin that.After her falling, things started to change for the worse, she was fully disconnected from reality at this point, but I was also to high to realize what was going on exactly. In my head, it was the acid making her feel pretty good and just goofing around, doing weird stuff, but it was anything but that.At one point she was laying on the floor on her stomach, shaking her rump-a-dump around acting very unlike her self. This was very odd because she can also be insecure as well, and is nothing like a hoe that'll do this for the fuck of it, but again I was still to high from the acid to put two and two together that she was so far from reality, she didn't really know what she was doing. We finally make it out side and goto the garage when things really went down hill. We were all messing around, giving each other shit and the lady was acting all big and tough so we told her to show us and pump some iron. She didn't really acknowledge that and did something else I can't recall. She started acting very violently towards me and my friend, but I was still under the impression she was goofing around and having a good time, so we kinda wrestled a little bit, but she was actually hitting kind of hard and struck me with a good right, so I put a stop to that. At one point she was screaming and yelling and that started making my friend kind of angry because of his neighbors possibly calling the cops and they kinda got into it and started at each other, but I instantly shoved both of them back telling them to knock it off.My lady friend at this point was uncontrollable, walking/running around yelling at the top of her lungs, flaling around and what not.We took her inside due to the scare of possible cops being involved, and she just wouldn't stop acting like this. My friend was still coming up on his 'cid and for a start to a trip all of this going on would not call for a good trip. He actually started to have a panic attack, and at one point was almost in tears. This whole time, I just wasn't really taking this serious as I really thought she would just start acting normal again and she was just enjoying her self. I thought she was horny cause she kept saying certain things pointing towards that and the acid was making it really intense to where she couldn't control her self (I really don't know what was going through my brain. I was so god damn high from the acid) so I took her to the bathroom, adjusted my self ;), and showed her that I could not stick it in right now due to the acid giving me limp dick. She saw that and kinda straightened up for a minute and I felt so much relieve, but then 'boom!' She was right back to acting how she was.[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] She was screaming at the top of her lungs now, and my friend was panicking more and more at this point and yelled 'do we need to take her to the hospital or something' and I said 'bro I really don't know this has never happened' (this was when it finally clicked that something was seriously rong roughly 4-4-1/2 hours into this trip) I told her, 'if you don't straighten up were gonna have no choice but to take you to the hospital. You're parents are gonna be involved (she was kicked outta her house and not on good terms and moved in with me) cops etc' and she sobered up really quick and said 'okay' and I said 'you good now, babe?', and she said something that shed been repeating a lot and so I carried her outta the bathroom saying to the friend ' were going to the hospital idk what's going on with her, Can we take your car I don't trust mine?', and he was basically already ready. I carry her out of the house, she pukes a little while being carried, I've been around tons of people puking, and puked a lot my self from duster, so it doesn't bother me, but something about this little puke she did the sound of it I can still hear clearly to this day (8-9 months later) I don't know how to explain it. On the way to hospital, I text my mom our safe word (shes a great mother, she doesn't like me doing drugs or anything, but she said if I'm ever in danger or anything text her this safe word and she'll be there as fast as she can) she wasn't replying so I called her 2 times in a row and she finally answered and I explained to her the situation. At this point, in the car, my lady was kinda screaming and what not, but basically just repeating certain phrases over and over, and having spastic movements. My mom told us to not go to hospital so no one official is involved, including her parents like right as we were at the front door, so we just parked there. My step dad, I think is secretly very knowledgeable when it comes to drugs, so I'm sure that was his idea. They told us to get some orange juice to see of that'll help her, it ended up being spilt over my friends car. My friend started freaking out even harder, and couldn't drive and for some odd reason, I was practically sober, wasn't getting much visuals unless I really focused, and felt pretty calm in the head to try to keep the peace between us all, so I drove us to the house.Basically by now she was not screaming or anything, she was just repeating phrases over and over. She would be like this until she came down, some 6 hours later. This killed me to see her like this. This girl is the love of my life, and seeing her so out of control, having no idea what she's doing, out of her mind hurt so bad and it still sometimes does to this day.We're at the house now safely, thank God, and she's just doing the same stuff, my parents show up roughly 15 minutes later, and when I'm in their car everything feels so much better. Everything is so much more calmer, I knew we were gonna have a nice long talk about this, but that wasn't the matter at the moment. I felt so safe with them, and finally for the first time that night, I knew my girl was gonna be okay. I left everything I brought with me there, even my shoes, I just wanted to leave and be in the comfort of my parents. I gave my friend a hug cause he was shaking and rocking back and forth and kind of crying and said 'I love you bro' and left.We made it home and my parents went inside cause my lady was being difficult and I couldn't get her out of the car and she was basically under control, just looping out loud still. It was so odd, I would tell her things about the real world and her pupils would shrink back to normal size, and for litterallly a split second, I knew my lovely girl was back, but then instantly bam, she was gone, pupils so large there was no color in them, just black from such dilated pupils. Those sights of her eyes have scarred me and I can still picture it crystal clear. It was the oddest/heart wretching thing to see her come back to reality fully, then a second later she was gone. I hated my self for getting us the acid, saying we should just take 8 a piece, I hated my self for everything that lead up to that. I got her inside and our dog even knew something was wrong with her, he was being extra sweet to her, giving her kisses and he even had a worried look on his face. We got her laid down in bed and she sat there in the same position for an hour or so, looping away.Then another couple of hours she was finally able to fall asleep, but I was still worried so everynow and then I would listen to her breathing, feel her heart beat to make sure it wasn't to fast or to slow. I even woke her up sometimes when she would make noises asking her if she was okay. I kept saying, 'I'm so sorry for tonight', but she didn't understand why I was saying that and I told her, 'I'll tell you in the morning'. While she was asleep, kind of, I would go to our back porch and smoke cigs and just cry to my self. I was so torn up that I would let me and the love of my life get into that situation, I'm here to protect her and never let her get into sticky situations, never let her get hurt or anything, and I failed. I would go to our back porch and smoke cigs and just cry to my self. I was so torn up that I would let me and the love of my life get into that situation, I'm here to protect her and never let her get into sticky situations, never let her get hurt or anything, and I failed. I morally failed at doing that all night. It was the worst feeling ever looking back at that night, the worst empty, sickening feeling in my stomach I have felt to this day. I still feel that sometimes. The next morning when she woke up, she sat straight up and looked around super confused as to why we were back at our house, she didn't remember a thing. I explained to her what had happened and she could not believe it, but slowly some memories she had of that night slowly came back to her. Her side of the story is jaw dropping, she had a completely different experience then what had actually happened. Literally a completely different story than what I just told.After this night, I swore to my self and her that I would never ever let us get into that kind of situation ever again. I made it my goal to look out for her if we were doing drugs, rather it just pot, alcohol, anything. I would never let her go through this again, because one time when she was looping out, she said 'I just want it to stop, make it stop please'. This stood out to me cause again in that moment, my girl was back, but was gone right after she said that. I knew she would come back enough to realize she was miserable, but just couldn't do anything about it. It literally broke my heart in so many ways.We will probably never tough acid again, due to the fear of this trip. It is engraved into our minds and memory. It will stick with us forever. We are in a lot better place now. I'm in my dream college, passing it with flying colors, and she is in school for something she really enjoys. I'm so happy for us. We have so much good going for us, I know we're gonna have a great future, despite our interactions with drugs.I will talk to her after work and see if she wants to include what was going on in her world for this report. If not, you guys will know. Safe travels, comrades! Hi I'm the little lady of the story you just read and now I'll tell you my side of everything:My drug experience Pot: use to love it then it became more of a struggle Acid: both good and bad experiencesXanax: I love it but it makes me stupid, though I do wish I could experiment more with itMolly: absolutely amazing Meth: best hyped feeling I've ever experiencedExtacy: second best feeling I love feeling more open while on x Oxy: very mellow drug and helped me do my job a lot easierDuster: it was fun but probably the most stupid drug I've doneGas: not really that much to my experience so I'll give it a 1/10 Kratom: it's a good substance when yoou can't actually do drugsMorphine: by far the best thing on this earth, it is the best thing I have experienced so far with any substance I've done.How I refer to what happened that night was me being in my dream world. I'll be honest I have always been the kind of person to keep quite about my opinion if someone else wanted something different (this is a bad habit I don't suggest getting into) and that night I had a bad feeling about tripping that much and with someone else but I blew it off because I have the tendency to ovethink things and I figured it was just that. I still felt good enough about everything to think everything would be okay.When I started feeling the effects from dropping acid,about 20 minutes later, I was feeling good but I suppose more retreated now that I look back on it. When we got back to the house after getting stogys I started feeling really odd and kind of not good, it was a lot of effort to stand so I sat at the table in the yard for a minute, when it seemed like something was really off I decided to go knock on the bathroom where my boyfriend was, I wanted to tell him there was something up but for one it seemed like too much effort to really talk and two I didn't want to seem like I was trying to bring the mood down so I said nothing. Another note is with a couple of the last trips before this one, I would get sick on the come up which started up randomly after a few times tripping so I thought it was something I was going to get over and start feeling better again.The next thing I remember is walking through the woods and my boyfriend and his friend were walking ahead and I couldn't hear what they were saying, I felt a brief moment of loneliness and had a slight thought they were talking about about me which was just an irrelivent paranoid thought( this small moment has played a dramatic roll in me now even today which I will explain later on) but as we were walking that's when I saw the sharp cartoon grass explained in the first part of the story and that was the last visual I saw the whole night. I supposed I had begun blacking out between those periods because the next moment I experienced was we were in the room playing a gameNow bare with me this is where things get confusing. When we were playing the game I asked to play and in my dream world I thought I was doing good but my boyfriend kept saying I was gonna die which was confusing.. This was my first glimpse of reality when I was in my dream world. I feel like if someone would had told me to snap out of it right then and there I might have been okay because that was the last moment of the real world that I had before it got all distorted by my dream world. The next glimpse I remember was us walking down the stairs and me falling all the way down. The pain kind of brought me back to what was going on in reality but my mind was still morphing it into some dream of mine.The next thing that happened that I can actually semi explain was when we were in the garage and both my boyfriend and his friend kept telling me to get mad over and over (this didn't actally happen in reality) I decided to yell and run over to the punching bag and hit it and then at another time me and my boyfriend were having a hitting match which in my dream world seemed normal and fun( its like those moments when you dream something completely odd but you think it's okay anyway until you wake up) I remember slapping my boyfriend in the face hard and he did it back and I felt a pain in my cheek that made my right eye water and for a second I thought that this wasn't normal but in an instant my dream state sucked me back in and made it seem like it was a playful thing that was okay. The thing about my dream state is everything in it seemed so dark but instead of letting me be afraid of it, it was convincing me it was good, and if anything negative happened it would almost shield me from it and I would be all happy again.The next big event that happened was we were all in the car driving and I was completely in my dream world at this point. It was like I was hitting duster and blacking out which is a scary thought because I was already blacked out in a dream state but when I 'hit duster' I would completely black out and later on wake up, this happened multiple times and one time our friend, who in the real world WAS our friend, but in my dream state I thought was my boyfriend, kept smacking my cheek trying to wake me up from passing out( this never actually happened in reality and I never even actually passed out at all.) When I was 'conscious' and we were driving I would wake up to us stopping at the same stop sign, passing the same semi, and pulling up to the same store over and over. It would happen in the same order, I would wake up experience one thing, pass out experience the next, and then it would all repeat over and over. When I was 'conscious' and we were driving I would wake up to us stopping at the same stop sign, passing the same semi, and pulling up to the same store over and over. It would happen in the same order, I would wake up experience one thing, pass out experience the next, and then it would all repeat over and over. As I came to find out the next day there never was a semi that passed us at all and the store I recalled we never pulled up to either. I remember us driving and someone on Bluetooth talking to my boyfriend crying and saying ' she needs help' and so on which sounded to me as if we were trying to make an intervention for someone on drugs and during that moment it felt like me, our friend, and my boyfriend were all like brother and sister and the person on the phone was our mom who I imagined being a overweight person, little did I know it was my boyfriends mom on the phone talking and everything I heard her say didnt match up with what was actally said but they were discussing about me, (also his mom is not fat at all haha) As the night went on I would pass out and wake up to find one detail change than how it was before, the car would be a different color or the seats would be different. And I believe it was a transition from our friends car to my boyfriend's moms car. I would continue to do so until everything was transitioned completely. Every time I would wake I would see little patches of the real car and reality as it really was, but even though I could still basically see everything my mind was still converting it into a dream Some how. Everything kind of seemed calmer after and I do remember pulling up to my mother in laws house and lying in bed. This whole time I just thought this was one big huge trip and I was just going along with it, it never crossed my mind anything wasn't was unusual from all the other times I tripped, the last visual I saw was the grass, everything else was just a dream. When I woke up the next day and realized we weren't still at our friends house and we were in fact at his mom's, everything was so confusing and I kept thinking about what all was real and what wasn't, turns out not much of what I actually experienced was real. A big lesson I learned from that night is to never abuse Lucy because she will fuck my shit up. From the first time taking acid it changed how I react to smoking pot. I will say that since that night, instead of smoking for comfort and joy, it's been a constant battle that has messed with me ever since. When I said to remember that brief moment of loneliness when I couldnt hear my boyfriend and friend talk, and how I thought they were talking about me, well every time I smoked pot after that, I could hardly hear what people were saying even if there right in front of me, and I constantly thought everyone is talking about me and even though it was a long time ago, acid is still affecting me through pot. One tiny little moment that happened that night, out of everything else, has stuck with me still. I am now incredibly paranoid which I use to not be and I hardly enjoy smoking any more, it's made my social life horrible and I still don't really know how to get over it. I am now incredibly paranoid which I use to not be and I hardly enjoy smoking any more, it's made my social life horrible and I still don't really know how to get over it. It's basically branded in my brain and if I would have known how strong acid can be even long after a trip, I would have been much more smarter with my choices.Thank you guys for taking your time to read this. I know it is long, both of our experiences during this night, but there is no short version of this trip.Again, Safe Travels, Commrades!Exp Year: 2016ExpID: 111135Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 17 Published: Oct 5, 2018Views: 1,562    LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Post Trip Problems (8), Second Hand Report (42), Relationships (44), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:1.5 tabletsoralLSD(blotter / tab) 1 hitsmokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:125 lbIt was a spur of the moment decision to take acid, which I realize now is not something that you should do with psychedelics.  There was an enormous jazz festival at my school and my fiance Delyriem and I thought it would be incredible to watch a jazz concert while tripping.  I had listened to jazz on mushrooms before and found it to be hilarious, and so I imagined that it would be a similar experience on acid.  What I didn't take into account was the insane amount of stress in my life at the time, and although I know it's a bad idea to take psychedelics when stressed, I didn't really think about it.  I had tripped on mushrooms a few times, and had attempted to take acid twice but both times it turned out to be DOB and I didn't trip hard at all because the dose had been too small. We decided to split 3 doses in case it was DOB again, so at least we'd trip a little if it wasn't real acid.We weren't sure if we could get tickets, and didn't want to take the acid until we were sure we got seats, so we didn't take it until about half an hour into the concert.  20 minutes after we took it, it was intermission and I had a sinking feeling that we wouldn't come up until after the concert.  However, I did start having some intense visuals a few minutes into the second half of the show, and everything started being abnormally funny.  I felt like the musicians were all talking to each other with their instruments.  I could understand what the musicians were saying, but knew that it couldn't be put into words.  When one of the guest musicians started scatting, it got especially intense and confusing because he was using his voice without actually saying words and so it seemed like he was communicating with the instruments with his voice in a way that I realized no one else could understand except me and Delyriem because we were the only ones with the 'full experience' I thought.  I felt incredibly happy, everything was so silly.  As soon as the concert was over we stood up and realized we needed to get out of the auditorium immediately because I was in no state to run into people I knew and have to talk. I was just tripping madly. We went back to Delyriem's room, and laid in his loft bed, just laughing about everything.  We must have sat there laughing for about an hour, I honestly have no clue what we were talking about, but everything was hilarious.  I remember saying things about having two voices, laughing voice and normal voice, because our voices sounded very strange when we were laughing constantly.  I was getting some visuals but not as intense as I'd had on mushrooms. We watched the ceiling, the walls, and some optical illusions on his computer.  His roommate was in the room, and he knew we were tripping, but then our friend ML came in, who didn't know either of us had done drugs. We tried to act as normal as we could but I could not stop laughing.  ML was talking a lot about strange things that Delyriem and I found hilarious, and I had been staring at an optical illusion for a while so her body was swimming around and her face was twisting and melting and I had to pretend that everything was normal. She kept walking in and out of the room and every time she left we would crack up again, for no reason at all.  Then she'd come in and we'd try to act normal.  I was still having a lot of fun.  Our friend Aj had called earlier and wanted to know if we wanted to watch Fear and Loathing in las Vegas.  We thought it was a good idea, so at this point we decided to meet her on campus and walk to town to another friend's house to watch the movie.  We met up with Aj who was with another friend of ours. They were both sober, but had tripped before so they knew kind of what was going on for us.  They said they had to stop at a few places first before going to watch the movie.  I didn't really feel comfortable going to any parties, and said I wanted to stay outside and we'd wait for them.  As we walked through our small town, I felt like we owned the streets. Everything struck me so funny still, the way we walked through the town, kind of strutting down the sidewalk like we could do whatever we wanted.  Everything Aj and our other friend were saying was so funny to me and I kept laughing at everything.  I still have no recollection of what we talked about or why it was funny. It was inexplicably hilarious at the time though.  We were going to our friend B's house, but he was at the house where a bunch of theater kids lived, playing beer pong.  He invited us to come in and I said no, but he said everyone there would be cool with us tripping.  I agreed to come in when he said there was a hookah, I wanted to smoke.  We went inside and immediately I knew it wasn't the best situation.  I saw a bunch of people I knew who I didn't want to know I was doing drugs.  I tried to act as normal as I could and ignore that I was tripping. This is when it started to go bad.  I realized later that what set me off was trying to act in a normal way, because I couldn't figure out what normal was, and that got me freaked out.  The party was full of drunk people, some talking to me.  I tried to smile and laugh at the appropriate times, but I had to think really hard to decide when to nod or smile, etc.  There was some sort of a bong going around, and I took a hit off of it.  My lungs had never felt so strange, the flavor was not at all like what I imagined it would be and it was cold.  Startled, I began to cough, and I suddenly couldn't remember what was normal in any sense of the word. I didn't remember how to breathe normally, and continued to cough every few seconds.  My throat and lungs burned and every sensation was like I was feeling it for the first time.  My tongue in my mouth, the way it felt to swallow...it was all new to me, and I still couldn't remember how to breathe.  Delyriem asked if I needed water, and left to get me a glass.  The moment he left I got sucked into my head.  I was alone in a crowded room.  My thoughts were uncontrollable, I had no clue what was going on. I was alone in a crowded room.  My thoughts were uncontrollable, I had no clue what was going on.  My body felt strange, I was staring into space. I didn't have any visuals at this point so I didn't really remember that I was tripping, I just knew that I felt very strange.  Suddenly I was outside, I don't remember getting up at all, just sitting on the porch outside.  The whole thing was like a dream, like nothing I'd ever experienced in trips before.  I was completely disoriented, lost in my mind, hearing people talking but not sure what was going on. I'd piece together things they'd say, but never was really aware of the conversation as a whole.  Someone said something about sneaking to a car and I become paranoid, thinking we were hiding from someone.  I heard the word 'acid' and suddenly remembered that I'd taken acid. A couple seconds later I forgot again, but remembered almost instantly.  The same thought ran through my head every few seconds, 'oh yeah, I took acid. Why was everything so strange? Oh yeah. I took acid. Why do I feel so funny? Oh yeah. I took acid.'  Then I realized that I was thinking the same thought and I became freaked out, stuck in a loop of perpetual realization.  Everything was a blur, suddenly I was at B's apartment on the couch, watching Fear and Loathing.  The movie is hard to follow when I'm sober, but I had no clue what was going on.  It was like Johnny Depp was explaining to me what had happened, and every time I heard the word acid in the movie I'd remember again that I'd taken acid, but was never sure if I'd actually forgotten or not since the last time I remembered.  I never saw B leave the room, but he seemed to keep coming in the room over and over, sitting down on the couch.  He joked that he had a trap door by the couch, and I knew he was joking but I didn't understand how he could keep coming in without leaving unless there was a trap door.  Nothing made any sense.  I was with Delyriem the entire time but felt distant from him.  I was leaning on him while we watched the movie, but the entire time I was stuck in my head, not able to escape. I wanted to talk, and somehow get out of my head, but I didn't know what to talk about. I couldn't remember why I had taken acid. It was supposed to be fun to trip but this wasn't fun.  I couldn't remember what it meant to trip.  What was that feeling, was it a good one? Then I started getting visuals again and I remembered that visuals were a part of tripping. I felt a little bit of comfort once I started getting visuals because it helped me to feel like I was on a drug, instead of just a state of confusion. I still felt uneasy, and I kept trying to grasp onto the trip and make it fun like it had been in the beginning, just laughing. I would force myself to laugh at the movie, realizing that it was silly and didn't make sense. I knew the nonlinear fashion of the movie was messing with my head, but even though I knew the movie didn't make much sense anyway, I couldn't get out of my mind loop. I continued to feel uncomfortable but wasn't sure why I felt uncomfortable. I continued to feel uncomfortable but wasn't sure why I felt uncomfortable. I had to go to the bathroom, so I asked where the bathroom was, and B told me the second stall was the ladies' room, and something about the mens room having a dart board.  Because it was a pretty normal apartment I thought he was being figurative or something, it didn't make sense to have a ladies' room.  I wandered into the apartment, but couldn't figure out where to go. I walked into a few rooms, looking for a toilet. Finally I stumbled into a room that had two toilet stalls, like in a public bathroom.  I stared at them, trying to figure out if I was in a dream...it didn't make any sense to me.  I stood for a long time staring at the bathroom. Unsure of what to do next.  My body felt strange, I wasn't sure if I actually had to pee or not, or what it felt like to have to pee or not have to pee. My body felt strange, I wasn't sure if I actually had to pee or not, or what it felt like to have to pee or not have to pee. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] Eventually I went back to the room to watch the movie more but I couldn't handle being in my head so I told Delyriem I had to talk.  We went in the kitchen and I told him I was in a bad place in my head.  He tried to comfort me but somehow he still seemed far away. I didn't know what to talk about, I tried to explain how I was feeling but because my mind still didn't make any sense.  I don't remember much else about being there, but eventually B said he'd drive us back.  I remembered then that he was really drunk, and said that we could walk back.  A few minutes later though I was in the car, forgetting again that he was drunk.  We got back into Delyriems room, the first time since we left that I felt in a familiar place.  I knew where I was and it seemed a little more normal.  I thought it was about time that my trip was over, and I was hoping it would settle down soon.  I kept trying to explain what I had been feeling to Delyriem, but as I would explain I would get stuck in my head again and would become afraid.  I didn't know if it would ever be normal again. I was close to tears a few times, uneasy about everything that was going on.  I wanted to sleep, but my mind wouldn't calm down.  I tried to sleep a few times but would jolt back awake in terror after a few moments of restless sleep.  I was laying next to Delyriem and wanted to be cuddling with him but I felt exhausted and couldn't get enough energy to pull him close to me.  He was clearly worried about me and kept apologizing about me having a bad trip.  He tried to bring us back to a silly place like the beginning of our trip but it seemed clear that he was too worried about me to enjoy himself very much. I had to go to the bathroom again, and went upstairs.  I told myself that I couldn't look in the mirror, knowing I could get stuck looking at myself.  I washed my hands, avoiding myself in the mirror, but when I looked up to grab a paper towel I saw my cheeks move, kind of fluttering or twitching.  I stared, trying to figure out what I'd seen and so I smiled at myself, and watched in awe as my cheeks moved abnormally fast and kind of shuddered. I began to stare at myself, and watched myself become cartoon-like.  I was completely 2-dimensional for a while, then I suddenly realized that I was watching myself, and I was the mirror. I could see the real me through the mirror, but I was separated from myself.  I don't know how long I watched myself, before realizing that Delyriem was probably worried about me.  I walked back downstairs and Delyriem was at the door waiting for me, alarmed at how long I'd taken.  I told him I got stuck in the mirror, trying to explain what I'd seen.After laying in bed for a while longer, he told me he couldn't sleep and asked if I would stay awake with him.  We got back out of bed and sat facing each other in chairs. I had intense visuals still, after about 7 hours of tripping hard.  He started to look like the visuals in Fear and Loathing, his face was bulging in and out, in squares and circles.  I couldn't see straight, and just wanted it all to end.  I was tired of the visuals, I just wanted Delyriem to look like he normally did instead of a stretched out strange version of him.  He kept looking cartoonish, and I could see all the colors in his hair instead of just brown, I saw green and purple strands that mixed to make what looked like brown.  I had never had such intense visuals so far into a trip. It was starting to hurt my eyes because the intensity of the colors, and being unable to focus. Eventually around 6 or 7 in the morning I drifted off to sleep after many more terrifying failed attempts.  I was afraid to sleep because I thought that because tripping was kind of like a dream, it meant that I would have to go through a few more hours of tripping before waking up to normalcy.  I had an entire night of nightmares, and even when I woke up at noon the next day I felt disoriented and out of place.  For a few hours after being awake I couldn't decide if my thoughts were normal again, couldn't figure out what it was like to be conscious.  I was afraid that I would never wake up from the trip, that I would never be the same or figure out how I thought normally.  I imagined becoming schizophrenic, kind of tripping for the rest of my life.  Delyriem and I talked continuously about the trip, trying to work it out in my head what had happened and why I felt the way I did.  Before going to sleep we had looked at a reputable harm reduction website's facts about LSD to assure me that I would be okay, and I kept trying to reassure myself.  I finally started to feel normal in the late afternoon, able to sort my thoughts out.  I know now that I was way too stressed about life at the moment to have taken a psychedelic, and I realize that I should not take such powerful drugs so spur of the moment.  Delyriem and I decided that we need a break from psychedelics for at least a while, which was really sad to decide, but we knew it was for the best until we felt ready again.Exp Year: 2008ExpID: 70308Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 21, 2018Views: 1,769    LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Music Discussion (22), Various (28) DOSE:7 hitsoralLSD(gel tab)   repeatedsmokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:110 lbI was 15 years old. I had taken lsd about 35 times previous to this halloween. The first time I took it I kinda enjoyed and kinda didn't. But I always looked forward to doing it. So, on halloween me and my friends decided to trip because it seemed like it would be fun. This was before I had a good understanding of powerful drugs like lsd. There was about seven of us. And we all bought light blue geltabs. And a few of us got some dark purple ones. Unknown to me the purple ones each had two doses in them. I'm a very small guy for my age, and had never had a bad trip before. I also have bi-polar 2.The night started off with alot of other people buggin us to get them some geltabs(it was from a semi exclusive source) and this ended up injecting 5 more people into the mix, and they weren't close friends. So we all took our acid, I ate a light blue and a 2 purple ones, but I thought I dropped one of them out of my mouth so I took another purple one. And we started smokng alot of weed out of a bong. We were chillin in my friends neighborhood in someones garage who we didn't even know. It was just getting dark and people were just starting to trick or treat. After about 5 bong bowls I started to feel real fucked up and I was feeling extremely uncomfortable with everything. I couldn't take bein outside anymore. My good friend noticed and suggested we go to his house for a little bit. So we did that.We sat in his room for a little bit. It was there I was starting to get schizo of the lsd. In his room I started to feel like I was in a moving spaceship and I couldn't get comfortable. Then our friend who was 21, tripping as well, showed up. We all considered him our drug mentor as it were. He came by to get us out of the house, he was worried about me. Right around the time we left I was feeling more fucked and confused than I had ever been. We went back down to the neighborhood, everyone I saw trick or treating was getting to me in a bad way. After we got back down there I layed on the grass just staring up. I was really starting to hate how I felt. My behaviour was getting erratic by now. I didn't want to be outside so I went home.I was at home flipping out basically. I tried to fall alseep at one point, I tried taking a shower, I was trying anything that popped in my head to get sober somehow. I contemplated calling my dad and telling him I fucked up bad, good thing I didn't. So after a while of my running around whacked out of my gourd, my friends came back by. They knew immediately I was having a bad trip. I thought I had the secrets of the universe figured out and everytime it was on the tip of my tongue it would go away and I was very confused, but I seriously believed this. And I kept thinking about x-3 whatever that is. At this point I was not me and I can't even explain what happened next. Too fucked up for words.My friends saw a bottle of my medicine sitting out and thought I overdosed on them, which I didn't. Then they dragged me out of my house and I made an ass out of myself in front of alot people on the street. My friends didn't handle the situation right at all, they were slapping me and stuff like that. Later on I ended up coming down, but still thought they were doing magic tricks and things like that. I've left out a good deal of what happened because I can't even explain it.I ended up learning alot of things from it. Lsd isn't a 'fun' drug. For the right person it makes a good shaman tool. It doesn't make your body feel good at all. The only thing enjoyable about it are the hallucinations, but for that I have to eat too much. I haven't tripped in 5 years, and never will again. I did trip again after that a few times. Lsd is stupid in the hands of a kid.Exp Year: 1998ExpID: 16365Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 30, 2018Views: 922    LSD (2) : Various (28), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), General (1) BODY WEIGHT:110 lbThis past Halloween weekend I took some LSD. While I had a good and insightful trip, I also had a frightening experience that tested the strength of my psyche.We all know that set and setting is essential to an acid trip. I was at a good friend's party. I thought it was just going to be people we knew, but it turned out there were friends of his roommate as well. And one of them took an interest in me. (He was not tripping, by the way.)We got to talking and just to make conversation, I asked him if he was in college. He responded, 'No. I am a private military contractor. I go into foreign countries, take care of business there.. and yeah. I can't really tell you anymore.'I was like WTF. Let me just say, when I am tripping on acid, that is the last thing I ever want to hear. Especially being the peace-loving, environmental girl that I am. And this guy is telling me he's involved in top secret mercenary activities?!Even if I was just normal, this would scare me. Um yeah.. I was tripping on acid and terrified.My interpretation of private military contractors kill people in defense of business and government interests. They are involved in guarding corrupt political figures, training militias, and protecting 'resource extraction sites', such as diamond mines and oil fields. They defend this exploitative, unsustainable way of life. It scares me that people like this exist. It scares me that we live in such a violent and unsustainable world. He told me how he served two years in Iraq, and how he'd just gotten back from diamond mines in the Congo. It was all very hard to handle while tripping on acid. The icing on the cake was when he said, 'I'll be right back, I have to go to the hummer'. I was like are you serious. It was like a ridiculous joke at that point. It was a terrible encounter, but I managed to draw some positive conclusions from the experience. I feel like a stronger person than ever before. I feel stronger about my beliefs than ever before. What i know to be right, good and true~ I am more sure about than ever.Exp Year: 2010ExpID: 88036Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 21 Published: Oct 31, 2018Views: 873    LSD (2) : Large Party (54), Therapeutic Intent or Outcome (49), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5) DOSE:1 tabletoralLSD(blotter / tab)   smokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:165 lbI was always interested in the the effects of LSD and mushrooms long before I was ever involved in drug use myself, mostly because I knew it had inspired some of my favorite musicians, authors, and other figures I admired.  I was experienced with marijuana, having been smoking for the better part of a year and had been actively looking for shrooms for close to two months at the time but the connections kept falling through.  When my friends told me they had an acid hookup who was good I bought three hits, one for me and two of my friends who I will call C and J, with a kind of nervous excitement.My friend C ended up taking his hit a few days before J and I, and I spent the day with him to see how he reacted.  His trip seemed very mental, though just from smoking weed with him on a regular basis I knew he often ended up in his head while I tend to be enthralled by how things look and sound and was expecting a very different trip than the one he had.J and I took our hits at approximately 4:30 in the afternoon a few days later in our dorm.  I noted the blotter paper had a vaguely metallic taste.  I kept the paper on my tongue for about 20 minutes until it dissolved and I swallowed it.  After swallowing our paper J and I went downstairs where he smoked a cigarette (I don't smoke) and then we went into the store and each bought a bottle of orange juice to sip on while we waited for the effects to set in.Back in our dorm we were starting to feel the onset of the acid.  I had butterflies in my stomach and was feeling very excited, though I can't say for sure if this was the effect of the drug or just my natural excitement about what was about to happen.To occupy our minds for a while J put on “Wasp/ Behind the Wall of Sleep/ Bassically/ N.I.B.” by Black Sabbath with the Classic iTunes visualizer on.  I'm not sure at what point during the almost ten minute song I actually began tripping, but when it finished and I pulled my eyes away from the screen the effects of the acid were definitely hitting me.  The outline of my hand specifically seemed to undulate, like it was breathing.[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] It was at this point that J and I gave C a call to drive us around and smoke some weed as we had planned.  He took us out and we drove around our usual burn routes and the three of us smoked two bowls I believe.  The music playing in the car was all encompassing. I was trying hard to keep up in C who was quite talkative (as he tends to be when high) but the sensory experience was too powerful and I really didn't hear much of what he had to say from the back seat.  As we were driving I watched the clouds which had some of the most interesting visuals of the entire trip, the clouds seemed to bloom outwards into starburst shapes in time with the music we were listening to.  We parked beside a river which we had planned on going to watch but J vetoed the idea in favor of sitting in the car and listening to music.  I was fine with that idea at the time, enjoying the view of the bushes outside (the branches of which were waving around in a very lifelike manner) though in retrospect I wish we had gone out to enjoy the river.  Inside the confines of the car I started to get sucked into my mind and grew somewhat silent.It's hard to explain, but it was as though my mind split into two halves, one that was caught in a standard stream-of-consciousness and one that was watching the other half critically.  The second, critical half kept questioning if I was tripping (as the visual effect of the drug was quite different than I had anticipated) despite the fact that I obviously was.  Every now and then I was struck by an epiphany, that the only reason my mind was acting strange was because of the drug and then I would be happy to watch the world for a while, but then I would sink back into the uncomfortable mind patterns.  A change of scenery probably would have done me good to keep my mind occupied, but in the end J and I went back up to our dorm thinking that the familiarity of our dorm was what we really wanted.In the dorm I laid down on my bed while J chose music.  The acid was making me feel completely strange by this point, though it isn't anything I can really put my finger on.  Everything simply seemed completely alien to me on a fundamental level The acid was making me feel completely strange by this point, though it isn't anything I can really put my finger on.  Everything simply seemed completely alien to me on a fundamental level, I remember even my blanket felt strange.  J put on the Klaxons, a band that I wasn't familiar with at all, which added to the alien nature of the world around me immensely.There is a period of time here that I lost.  I don't know how to explain it except in contrast to how I felt when I snapped out of it: When I sat up what felt like an eternity after laying down on my bed (though it was probably not very long at all) it was as though I suddenly remembered who I was and where I was, and yes, I had in fact taken acid earlier.  The period of time in which I was laying down was one without thought, not even comprehending everything that I was seeing, hearing, and feeling.  The one solid memory I have of the experience was the poster beside my bed, a Klaxons poster to match the music.  The poster is set up like a collage and all the pieces of it were moving around each other in a fluid and slightly disorienting manner.After snapping out of my trance if you will I was quite worried about the road the acid was taking me down.  I was aware that the trip I was having was not what I really wanted to have but just the fact that I knew I wanted to have a better trip seemed to calm me down.  What I really wanted was something normal to grab on to instead of the strangeness I had been going through and thinking about my trip as just the effects of a drug was a good start to grounding myself in reality.  J had also been having a mental trip and was for us finding a change of scenery.  My depth perception was all messed up as we walked down the hallway to the elevator, it almost seemed like the floor was slanted.Outside, J called another friend of ours, B, who invited us to his room to play a round of Nazi Zombies.  I got myself under control in B's room while he and J played videogames but still had an anxious, nervous undercurrent to everything I did.  After a few minutes we had to leave B so he could study so J and I stepped outside and I called a friend of mine, M, who was a very experienced tripper.  I told M I was on acid and he immediately asked if everything was beautiful and perfect.  I told him it was more strange than I had expected, almost too disjointed from reality and he helped to talk me down.  Just hearing his voice practically lifted the anxious feeling from my trip and made me feel comfortable again.  He told me some websites to go to and by the end of our conversation I felt like I had risen above the trip and it was no longer in control.After talking with M I was feeling tons better, but J was still floundering with the drug so he and I decided to go on a walk around the campus.  Being outside felt much better and we found a good spot to sit on campus underneath a sort of bridge that connected two halves of a building. We probably sat for an hour or more, sometimes silently sometimes talking.  Outside I finally returned to some visual effects of the trip; the bricks in the wall across from me seemed to be moving, every other row seemed to be scrolling to the left or to the right.  I talked about how I underestimated the acid, how it was completely different than I had anticipated.  He said that he too wasn't having a “normal” trip but had been spending most of the time thinking about his life, school, and other concerns that he had been having.  We decided that while we weren't having a normal trip it was still positive in the end.  It had put things in a new perspective for both of us.  Sitting outside there calmed us both down and put us in a sort of self-cleansing state of mind.  The total experience had left me emotionally exhausted, the way I feel after a heavy cry and something I hadn't felt in a long time.By this point it was after 10:00 pm (it was the first time I really became aware of time) and me and J decided to go to his friend A's house.  I was feeling down from the acid by this point (though still slightly disjointed from reality, like after a weed comedown) so I drove us to A's place where he and his girlfriend had been drinking wine.  The four of us all drank a bunch of wine, smoked a lot of weed, and watched Across the Universe.  The movie, alcohol, and marijuana all combined to bring back the tripping state of mind (though with virtually no visual effects) and left me feeling very comfortable, much more so than I had felt at any other part of the night.In the end, it was a good experience in that it taught me how to trip.  If I could go back I would probably do it slightly differently but I'm glad I had the experience.  I wish I had understood the drug more before I took it so that I could have prepared myself more fully I wish I had understood the drug more before I took it so that I could have prepared myself more fully but I feel that now my next time will be much more positive throughout.  More than anything this trip made me respect LSD more than I did.  As J said to me: “People think that acid is just like a cool light show or something, but really it can put you in your place.”  It was, ironically, quite a sobering experience.Exp Year: 2010ExpID: 85095Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 19 Published: Nov 12, 2018Views: 852    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Guides / Sitters (39), Music Discussion (22), Bad Trips (6), First Times (2), General (1) DOSE:1 tabletoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:80 kgWent up to the country with my friend 'andy' who I met this year, to his house with two of his friends, and one of my friends. None of us knew each other too well, but we all wanted to take LSD, were very naive, and had an intense time to say the least. We had four doses of LSD, in sugar cube form, two of them were three hitters (about 210 mics) and the other two were two hitter (about 140 mics). I was unaware that the doses were like this until just before we took the stuff, which meant that I pretty much was forced to have 3 hits, when I was only expecting to have 2, which made me more nervous and worried than I already was, not a good way to be when I'm taking lsd.Andy had the other three hitter, and the girls took the 2 hitters. We had another guy there, who was our tripsitter (and thank god for that). The effects started for me and andy a bit quicker than for the girls, I'm guessing because of the higher dose. About 20 minutes in, I remember getting the giggles, and was nibbling at an experience which was about to become full-blown and extremely intense.The first hour or so was absolutely amazing. I cannot put into words how mind bending this stuff was. My friends became cartoons, up became down, I ceased to exist, I started rambling like a madman and couldnt stop, I was continually posing questions of what must have been nonsense logic, and answering them immediately after. Basically my mind was not only doing backflips, but was doing them at light speed.Initially the trip was very visual- I was focussing on patterns (the rug was of great interest to me) and everything became totally stimulating. Just looking at a table or even more TOUCHING it! Such things became absolutely overwhelmingly brilliant. Of course, as any acid tripper will know, there' not much point trying to describe the feeling to someone who hasnt been there, because it gets misinterpreted. People imagine that LSD is just visual distortions, but fail to realise that it is a total shift in the way one perceives AND comprehends. I did at one point believe that I had died without dying, and that I was feeling oblivion. Anyway, as the trip got very very intense, it started to overwhelm me. I dont know the exact order of events, but at some stage, I felt like I was trapped, and had to get out and that nobody was listening to me, and that I had to be heard. I started yelling at the top of my lungs, and threw a wine bottle at my friends tv, smashing it. Basically it was all downhill from there. If that was bad as I got, I would not give a damn, but I got a hell of a lot worse. I had what I think is called 'LSD mania' which as the name suggests is where a person feels godlike, and can act on compulsion and do shit that no-one in their right minds would do. Basically I was on the verge of what became close to 'worst case scenario' I started getting aggressive, and the fact that my mind had gone through so many bizarre rationalisations, like 'people dont exist' and 'the world is best summed up as a set of pixels...' all sorts of craziness, didnt help me in making rational decisions. At this stage my memory weakens, but I remember distinctly feeling as if I was no longer steering myself. It was as if I had taken the back seat to my impulses, and had absolutely no control whatsoever. At this stage my memory weakens, but I remember distinctly feeling as if I was no longer steering myself. It was as if I had taken the back seat to my impulses, and had absolutely no control whatsoever. And this is where it gets ugly - my friend Jess became the object of my impulsive behaviour, and apparently I had to be pulled off her by force because I was groping her madly, and basically trying to have my way with her a number of times. She was needless to say traumatised, and after I calmed down, I couldnt understand the accusations that were being made against me. I had no idea what I'd done, and I couldnt handle the situation at all.I remember the next period very well, it was the most distressing thing in my entire life - I felt like time was repeating itself, going in a cycle of what must have been a few minutes, but felt like eternity. I really feared I was never going to see another day, and that I was trapped in this minute forever. I kept checking my watch, and time had dilated in my mind so much, that when I looked, expecting to see an hour having passed, it turned out to be about 1 minute. It was extremely distressing. And even though every time I saw my watch the time had moved a bit, I was still totally convinced that time was circulating, and I was trapped in a circle of time. Anyway, I spent the next 10 hours or so totally distressed and unable to sleep, extremely paranoid, and feeling like I'd never be able to be the person I was before. The next day I had my actions explained to me, and I was in such a state of shock (still reeling from the trip also) that I could barely bring myself to eat, and spent most of the day lying on the couch bewildered at myself. Basically my trip is a testament to just how much care I should have taken when planning to do acid.Exp Year: 2007ExpID: 66812Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 17, 2018Views: 860    LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:4 tabletsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:175 lbLSD awarenessLSD...One word AMAZING. The stuff is amazing. It's fantasy, mystery, bliss, and OBLIVION, all dropped into one. At the time of last ingestion I was 19. A buddy and I, experienced trippers, went up to the lake for a night of chillen and trippen. The whole evening went as planned. A fire for comfort, outside for peace of mind, and acid for the show. Each hour melted into another and before the millionth thought had melded with the ten millionth it was light. Time to head back to life and town. Each hour melted into another and before the millionth thought had melded with the ten millionth it was light. Time to head back to life and town. We paused to look at the sand under the water and ponder just how all the little valleys and towns had formed below the surface...very interesting at the time. Out of nowhere,(I say nowhere because the night had gone so well), blickity blam...........the sickest feeling in the world hit me. It was despair, fear, and evil rolled into one thought and then injected into my soul. I turned and looked at my bro.....his eyes reflected the same intensness that I was feeling. Before I could ask him he said ' Something is wrong...do you feel it?'. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] We ended up driving up into the mountains (which I had always enjoyed) but the feeling of 'evil' or 'despair' still plauged us. A literal 'shadow' was cast upon everything our eyes looked at. Very intense. We swore never to injest this chemical again....and nine years later neither of us have.It took quite a few years to 'recover' from the effects. For what seemed like a lifetime (6 years) I still saw spinning wheels in front of my eyes during my awake hours. The clouds would be full a faces at night. While affected by these persistent post trippen signs, I had to have faith and peace. I had to remember I was still in control of my life and mind. I could achieve whatever I determine to put my mind to. Since those younger years, I have married, had children, and acheived. I have still had an occasional momentary trip, but who cares.Exp Year: 1995ExpID: 21485Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 27, 2018Views: 1,010    LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Post Trip Problems (8), HPPD / Lasting Visuals (40), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:180 ugoralLSD(blotter / tab)   repeatedsmokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:185 lbMy goal of this report is to try and really instill the importance of not letting your experience and confidence with a substance override your knowledge of its dangers. Before the experience, I had 30+ acid trips. Background: Prior to this experience, I had experiences with the following compounds and plants:MDMA, MDA, LSD, Psilocybin, Cannabis, 2C-B, 2C-I, Diazepam, Ketamine, Amphetamine, DXM, 5-MeO-DMT, Changa, Cocaine,  Methylphenidate, Salvia, and Mescaline.Before I begin relaying my experience to you it is important to note that at the time of this experience, I recently started using cannabis again, after three-month abstinence, My recidivism to cannabis was not something I was particularly pleased about, as my relationship with the plant had become toxic and purely habitual.  Prior to this experience, I had been using cannabis again on a daily basis for around a month. The effects had changed since my abstinence, not drastically but enough to notice that it was causing a much more negative, somewhat irrationally negative form of introspection.Source & Setting:A Friend of mine had bought some LSD off a reliable source online that he had used many times and had always had received a quality product. Testing was done with an Ehrlich test to calm the anxiety that comes with taking a psychedelic. We planned to do our usual tripping routine, go for a walk around the surrounding countryside, Enjoying the visuals, have interesting conversations, the usual tripping activities. The Trip:A couple of days before we planned to drop I just didn't feel like taking acid and said to myself that I wouldn't take any but I would still come along for the walk. One of the many fatal errors laid in not telling my friends my change in mindset and continuing anyway.The day eventually came around, I woke up in the completely wrong mood. I really was not up for dropping any acid. I lay in bed contemplating not going and calling off my date with uncle Sid. Eventually, my two mates came knocking on the window of my flat at around 10 AM. I chose to ignore the knock, they rang my phone, rang the bell a few more times, shouted my name through the letterbox. And I didn't answer. Eventually, they left without me. Although they sent me a text asking me to call them once I was available.I lay in bed for another half hour or so, arguing internally whether to go or not.  Eventually, I got up, threw on some clothes, rang my friends and asked where they were, I met them at a lake which was about a 15-minute walk from my flat. When I met them they were in high spirits, they asked where I was and I told them I quickly had to go to the shop for some groceries. Off we set on our walk, 30 or so minutes into the hike the blotter was taken out and the other two were getting ready to drop their dose. I was handed my portion and in my overconfidence and overestimation of my experience with the drug dropped 180µg of LSD.T 00:40We arrived at an area of the woods that has a large fire pit, Are attempts to get a fire going were futile and we quickly gave up on the prospect of a comforting fire. At this point, a sense of nausea that I have always associated with LSD has started to creep up on me, No visual distortions but I definitely starting to feel different. My friends and I start to get the uncomfortable restlessness that is common with coming up on many acid, so we decide to carry on with our hike, To ease the process of coming up.  T 01:00At this point, trails are starting to appear, colors are becoming vibrant. My mind is in a good place I am enjoying being with my friends, Laughing, fooling around.  I remember at one point lying down on a bench looking up at the sky and seeing birds. The more I focused in on a group of birds more would appear and they would start crisscrossing across the sky forming these slippery hexagonal patterns, eventually, they would group together and be sucked up and disappear into what can only be described as an invisible plug hole in the sky. T 02:30Peaking, Everything is swirling and distorted, the simplest of things aren't making much sense. I can remember looking at the tarmac road we were walking on and all the stones it was made up of started to look like the bottom of small feet with this wave of shimmering purple dancing across the road. My mind is still in a good place and I feel in control of my thoughts. Although the sense of unease and nausea that usually disappears for me after the come up is still present. The concern quickly passed and I got on with my experience.T 03:30 We stopped for our second spliff of the trip on top of a hill overlooking a river and a cow farm. I rolled the spliff which took me about 25 minutes due to my eyes focusing sharply onto very specific parts of the spliff. An inconvenient hallucination but somewhat enjoyable. Once smoked it seemed to have little to no effect. We started to walk again. When we walked passed the cow farm we could hear the cows inside but could not see them. This was for some reason quite a dark, unsettling experience.T 04:30We were coming to the end of our walk and we decided to sit on top of a cliff that overlooked the surrounding moorland and river. prior to this the subject of where we should go after the walk was brought up, A decision was not agreed upon, and this created an air of anxiety, and made the feeling of unease within me a lot more prominent. We sat on this Cliff for around an hour watching the scenery distort and dance in front of us. During this time we smoked 5 joints in quick succession of each other. This was the dumbass decision that turned my enjoyable trip into a journey into a psychotic esq hell. T 05:30We left the cliffs in a typical silent stoned awkward way, still undecided of our next destination. This was plaguing my mind. At this point, dusk was coming around, the sky had turned a shade of pink and grey. and visibility was getting less and less. We climbed over a fence into a field that leads back into town when suddenly one of my friends frantically started to panic saying he was starting to have a bad trip. I quickly tried to calm him down which worked, he sat down and very quickly was down to baseline. for whatever reason, a wave of panic and anxiety washed over me and I couldn't stop thinking why he freaked out. I got stuck in a thought loop. my mates tried to calm me down, by this point, my mind was starting to rabbit hole. I was convinced we had taken something bad that wasn't LSD.The typical bad trip thoughts were overcoming me, I'm going to die, I'm going to be in this state forever, Now I'm starting to think of an immediate family member who has Schizophrenia, I start cursing myself out like you knew this was going to happen, you were testing fate.I am now fully lost in a negative confused mindstate. I'm no longer walking with my two friends, I'm 10 meters in front of them, Completely delusional  I was convinced that I had fallen into a coma at the fire pit and I was just dreaming the rest of the trip. In my delusional state, I came to the conclusion that I needed to go to the hospital so I could die, thus waking up from my coma. My two mates decided to take me to another friends house to get me inside and attempt to calm me downT 06:30Upon arriving at the house I was extremely restless my vision had been set to the pink and grey colors of the sky. And everything was breathing heavily. the confusing thoughts of why my friend freaked out persisted as did the coma delusion. I was led up to a bedroom and i lay on my mates bed trying to calm myself. as I closed my eyes it felt as if my body was slowly disappearing and my consciousness slowly unraveling. I was quickly hit with the thought I can't die here, I need to die in hospital. I called a close friend at this point who was not into drugs at all. I told him the situation and asked him to drive me to the hospital. He agreed and set off on his way.When he arrived roughly an hour later I was still a complete mess the visuals had calmed but the mindstate persisted. When I got in his car and shut the door a wave of calm came over me and a sense of safety.....This was short-lived, panic quickly shot back into my mind. And the delusion of death to regain my sanity returned to my mind. I tried to explain this to my friend but getting words out was almost impossible, they would almost frazzle out halfway through a sentence. T 08:00We arrive at the ER. a sense of clarity creeps back into my mind and I beg my friend not to take me into the ER. I tell him I fine and I'm starting to chill out. He rejects my plea and we go in. The whole process of telling the staff at the ER what was going on was so humiliating it gave me some clarity.  In the waiting room, I started to finally calm down and get extremely tired and just wanted to go home. A nurse took my blood pressure. It was crazy high, they wanted me to stay so they could do further testing I refused I told them I'm fine, just let me go home.  I could hear them talking behind the curtain about what I was here for. At this point, I feel like a complete tit. I just want to leave. By far the most embarrassing and scary situation I've ever been in all rolled into one.I walked away from this experience with no long-term side effects. No symptoms of HPPD. No flashbacks. I haven't smoked weed or touched drugs since.  Psychedelics can be a cruel but effective teacher.Exp Year: 2018ExpID: 112774Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 23 Published: Jan 4, 2019Views: 2,067    LSD (2), Cannabis (1) : General (1), Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:2.5 tabletsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:140 lbI was 22. Had just moved in with my boyfriend into a building that was being gentrified from a former crack house to the standard yuppie apartments (we had bullet holes in one window). As the renovations were ongoing for our time there it was rarely quiet and often workers walked in and out of our residence unannounced. But the day previous they stated they all had Sunday off, so that was when we decided to do our acid.Unfortunately my mind set was much as it is now and always has been. Depressed, anxious, paranoid, and pessimistic. I try to keep all that at bay and enjoy my life, but its difficult. So that Sunday morning with a freshly neat and cleaned apartment my boyfriend gave me two and half little pieces of paper. I put them in my mouth and left them for half an hour. He did the same.At first it was nice. It was sunny out. A warm late spring day in the midwest. Sun was streaming through the windows. I was with the man I loved and would eventually marry. I felt nice and cozy. The cat was on my lap purring. Just laying there purring. I wasn't even petting her. We decided to paint. Make some music. Draw some. Just do as we pleased.I honestly have no recollection of how it happened, but I found myself naked as the day as I was born and just laying on our bed. I was perfectly content to stare at the textures of the ceiling. Then someone knocked on the door. It seemed impossibly loud. My boyfriend hurriedly put his pants back and on and went to the door. The workers decided to try and get some time and a half pay. They were working Sunday.I heard all this while cowering naked in the closet and desperately clutching my confused cat for comfort. My man came back and tried to calm me down. It did not work.We returned to the bed (I had replaced my clothing), the cat sticking by my side for some reason, and tried to again find the calm comfy place we were. I couldn't find it. I could hear everything at once. Screaming children, running faucets, footsteps, conversations, the pipes being worked on downstairs and it all came from everywhere and nowhere. It was horrible. I started to cry. I thought of the sharks sticker in the bathroom, the bullet holes in the window, the phantom image of a toddler running by it I had experienced much earlier and while not all drug impaired. I decided then that he had been shot to death and cried even harder.The cat nuzzled my face and emitted a worried little meow in my direction. This for some reason struck me as hilarious. I then proceeded to laugh hysterically for approximately 15 minutes. At the site of my mate's worried face I then flipped into sobbing mode for a few minutes. Eventually the groaning, whining, screeching, and banging caused from the plumbing work below began to disturb him as well. It sounded like it was in our bathroom. The footsteps seemed to be in our hall. We looked but no one was there.We relocated ourselves to the front room and sat in front of the big windows and just basked in the sun for awhile. I was feeling pretty good. Then I heard a woman scream. Heard a kid being smacked. Heard a baby cry. I looked out and saw the beautiful tall old trees, taller than our building, and thought of all the horrible human mess below. I then proceeded to cry non-step for more than half an hour.We tried listening to music. It sounded like the musician was standing next to me, singing the words directly into my ear. I could not stand the sensation. We shut it off.Somehow I gave in to my man's request for sexual intercourse. I found myself naked on the bed again. I felt like I was going to sink into the mattress like someone sinks into quicksand and I assumed I would be suffocated. It took an intense effort to keep myself sane enough to recongnize the fear as completely insane. Then he was doing what guy's do and I was enduring it. I usually love it. I felt like my limbs were shrinking. Like rapidly deflating balloons and that my skull was collapsing. I thought he was going to meld with me like two plastic pieces being melted and stuck together forever. I felt like my limbs were shrinking. Like rapidly deflating balloons and that my skull was collapsing. I thought he was going to meld with me like two plastic pieces being melted and stuck together forever. We'd be like siamese twins conected at the genitals. I focused on staying calm. I heard footsteps, but disregarded them. I heard a man laugh. A man say, 'There indisposed.' Then a door close. I still do not know whether or not a worker walked in and witnessed or drugged copulation or if it was a hallucination.For the remainder of the trip we retreated to a newly empty room of the house. My man's schizo brother had moved back in with his mommy and taken his stuff with him. The large empty minimalist space soothed my mind and my racing heart. We sat on the floor and just stared at each other. Waiting out the unpleasantness. We seemed to read each other's mind. I leaned on the window while he went to use the toilet and was horrified at how I actually did want to do the cliche. I felt my body wanting to toss itself out the window and I fought with my hands to not open it and help me through. It was no death wish. There was a crack dealer standing below. It ocurred to me that it would be hilarious for a drugged chick to land on him and smash him.Fianlly, after 9 horrible hours the trip ended. I had never felt my depression, paranoia, and anxiety at a more intense level than when I was on LSD. I'm 26 now and still have never taken it again. And I never will.Exp Year: 1998ExpID: 14114Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 6, 2019Views: 995    LSD (2) : General (1), First Times (2), Bad Trips (6), Sex Discussion (14), Depression (15), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:3 hitsoralLSD(edible / food)   oralLSD(liquid) 3 hitssmokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:100 lb[Erowid Note: The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] It was about 10 at night and I was with my two roommates. We were completely bored so my boyfriend and I decided randomly to take some LSD. The other roommate doesn't really enjoy tripping that much but he was completely ok with just hanging out with us for the night. My boyfriend and I both had a 3 hitter sugarcube and we had the remnants of a vial left.  We had been saving this vile for sometime but didn't know quit what to do with it.  We just decided to go for it.  We then cut it open and licked out the remaining liquid in it. Stupid move, but we thought it would probably be a fun night. After the trip had ended I would say that it felt about like 9 hits total for the night?  That is a complete guess but just for the sake of trying to put a number on it, I think that's it.Just for the record we are both very experienced with LSD, although we had never taken quite as much as this we have taken 5-6 hits on a regular basis.  We have never had bad trips either, maybe rough moments but that's about it.It was almost instantaneous. Most likely because of us licking it out, I don't know.  I would say less than 20 minutes we were very much coming up.  Everything was going awesome though.  We were both feeling really great and decided to go down to the basement to play some music and just hang out.  My boyfriend, lets call him John, was playing guitar and I was playing piano, and it was awesome. Ha. Playing music while tripping is the most awkward yet satisfying thing. I became completely entranced in it. For full minutes at a time I would just go off on my own little solo and feel as though it was my soul speaking in music form.  I then decided to do some painting which only turned out to be bright colors and squiggly lines of weird faces and things. My other roommate, Frank was just playing drums completely happy watching us playing and painting terribly.  I would find myself just staring at the tapestry on the wall as the butterflies would almost fly off of it and around the room. I could feel their souls, they were real. The picture I was painting was real, the man's face I was drawing was speaking to me. Sometimes good sometimes mean things.  My spirits were still high though. After about an hour of this we decided to go upstairs, it wasn't quite as intense as we were expecting so we decided to smoke some weed. If there was anything we shouldn't have done, it was smoke weed.  We usually do quite a bit but almost instantaneously after smoking the other three hits from the sugar cubes brought us to our knees.  We were just sitting on the couch listening to Tom Waits and my world collapsed. The room fell over on itself. Frank told me afterwards that I said I'm going crazy, the world is falling apart. With each second the room would collapse on itself then the next second it would do it again and then again.  I would close my eyes and I had no idea what was going on outside of my mental head.  I had no idea if I was standing, sitting, laying, nothing. All I could feel was pure terror.  It was the biggest mind-fuck I have ever experienced. I remember looking up and seeing my roommate and being scared to death of him because he wasn't tripping with me and had no idea what I was going through. I curled up in my boyfriend's lap (who at this point later said that at that moment almost the same thing happened to him) and cried and kept repeating I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy.  After what seemed to be an eternity (I'm sure it was only a minute) I regained sight of what was happening, I was just tripping, it is only a drug.  We decided some fresh air would do us good. I think sometimes walking is the only way to go, so we walked.  The world was dark, not new and fresh like I had experienced in every other trip. There were demons lurking around every tree, every bush. Just keep walking, just keep walking. My heart was racing.  I would close my eyes and my body would disappear, my lip ring was the only thing that still existed. (It was really weird, but I think because I was biting it constantly that that's why I thought this) My body was dead. All that was left was my beating heart, I was a walking dead.  I asked several times if there was any way I could die from this drug only to have my boyfriend reassure me that there was no way on only 9 hits. We talked and talked, mostly about theology. We were completely unhindered to talk about religion, spirituality, and how we think the world should be.  God seemed utterly ridiculous. Religion was ridiculous. Culture seemed ridiculous.  I didn't even know why I even wore clothes. At one point during the night we saw a train go by.  We ran full sprint until we were about 5 feet from it.  It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen.  The only thing that was real at that moment was the train. Everything else was some sort of foreign world.  The train was almost comforting.  The sound of the whistles, the way the wheels sound on the tracks.  It was so large and so loud it took over my world for those few minutes. It was one of those moments that you are so overwhelmed that you just want to cry, not out of terror, but out of awe.  The wind from the train was absolutely breathtaking. From there we decided to go inside we were feeling a little better after that.  The house was so foreign. While walking up the stairs I felt like I was entering new worlds. If I looked at anything I could see a fourth dimension. It's really hard to explain, but it was definitely nothing like a 3-d world. The walls were more than breathing, they were alive.  The door would move so much that it could be on the other side of the wall. Everything had a spirit, everything had a voice talking to me, some comforting, some not so comforting.  I eventually had to lay on the bed, which is where I stayed for the rest of the night and closed my eyes.  I had to just let go of everything holding me back from having a good trip.  Every anxiety, I just had to let go of.  The world was swimming in itself. It was almost like the world was dancing. For the last couple of hours that is all that we did, lay there and let the music and the world dance with us.Exp Year: 2007ExpID: 64349Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 17, 2019Views: 871    LSD (2), Cannabis (1) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Music Discussion (22), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:1 hitoralLSDBODY WEIGHT:71 kgIn this report I'm going to be writing about an acid trip I had this summer that ended with me in the psych ward. Btw this my first time writing some sort of trip report, but I felt that I had to share this, and I’m hoping someone is going to learn from my mistakes and not use such a powerful and heavy drug as irresponsible as I did.It all started with my mother and my siblings visiting my grandmother (she basically lives on the other side of the country). I had been planning an acid trip for a while and this looked like a pretty good opportunity because I had the apartment all by myself for about a week.I wouldn't really call myself experienced when it comes to LSD, but I had dropped acid about 4-5 times before, but I never had a bad trip. That was about to change however.There was nothing wrong with the LSD, I bought it from a guy I trust and I had dropped the same acid before with the same dose. There was nothing wrong with the LSD, I bought it from a guy I trust and I had dropped the same acid before with the same dose. At around 17:00 two of my friends came to my house, I'm going to call them S and M. It was around that time I dropped my acid (155 mics). My friends had recently bought a relatively large amount of hash, and we decided to bake brownies. I wasn’t planning on using any cannabis or any other drug for that matter because I was being drug tested, and I also wanted pure acid trip, I feel like cannabis has a way of ruining a trip.Around 18:00 we went to the store to buy baking ingredients. About this time I started to feel the acid kicking in, this made me feel a bit paranoid because I felt like I was going to meet my mom’s friend or something in that fashion. I started to feel somewhat anxious and stressed which kind of built up during the trip.When we arrived at my apartment about 30 minutes later my friends started to cut up the hash bar to smaller pieces, and because of my heightened senses, the entire apartment smelled like a fucking dispensary. When we actually got to the baking point I forgot how to use my oven and got really uncomfortable and paranoid.Sometime later after we finished baking my other friend L came to my house, if I remember things correctly he was unaware that I was tripping but I think he found out eventually, which was very relieving because I felt like he treated me weird at first. After a while we went outside and they smoked a few joints, we were sitting by some thorn bushes and they made me extremely uncomfortable, I felt as if there was a dangerous animal behind me and I could feel its breath in my neck. I also made the terrible mistake of sitting in moss, because it got stuck on my legs and arms and I thought I had hundreds of ticks all over my body, I could also feel my eyes and fingers turning to some sort of mossy sand, however S reassured me that it was just a hallucination. I started to feel these disgusting rotten green tentacles ensnaring my entire body. This was when things started to get really horrifying.I think my friends noticed me getting uncomfortable so we went inside. I remember that the window was open and I felt the energy of the evil forest. Every time I looked through the window I would feel the tentacles slowly ensnaring me again.About 22:00 I got a call from my mother, and for some unknown reason I decided to answer, and she noticed something was off with me. I have no memories of the phone call, my short term memory was pretty much nonexistent at this point my short term memory was pretty much nonexistent at this point. I think that my friends left me because they didn’t want to get in trouble, I don’t blame them though.The next thing I remember is my dad knocking on the front door, and for some reason, his friend was there too, and he had lots of tattoos which in my brain meant that he was a Nazi. Suddenly I was in my dad's car. I think I started talking to him about Nazism, and I think they were joking with me, but my brain decided that they were threatening me about taking me to a concentration camp.All of a sudden my dad stopped the car immediately and I almost flew out of my seat, which triggered flashbacks from a car accident I was in when I was younger. He also played a song in the car that made me think my best friend had died. I think I had a memory loss because all of a sudden my dad was driving a tractor and he looked like Adolf Hitler. Then he drove into the psych ward, and all the houses were white red and black, confirming my concentration camp theory.I was unable to walk out of the car because of an extreme pain in my legs, for some reason I was also bleeding from my head. I think I had to be carried by my dad and a nurse who also was my English teacher except he was Danish (I’m going to call him J). I had another memory loss, and suddenly I was in a room on a bed with my dad and J. I had no idea how I got there or why, so I assumed it was a nightmare, but no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t wake up. I was stuck in a horrible nightmare and my only wish was to wake up, but I couldn’t.J took my blood pressure with those bands that go around your arm, and it felt like the life was squeezed out of my arm. I was being tortured by my English teacher. After practically killing my arm he asked me to take a shower, however, when I entered the bathroom there was no shower to be found. I suddenly realized I was about to be gassed to death, J tried to close the door and I started hearing an unpleasant horrendous agonizing sound that I don’t think is possible to explain in any human language, imagine hearing the end of your life and everything you love in audio, it sort of reminded me of planes bombing a city with air raid sirens in the background, but way more complex and horrible. I forced myself out of the bathroom in fear of my life. My dad and J were mocking me because I didn’t have the guts to die. I tried once again for some reason to enter the gas chamber, once again I heard that horrifying sound of the doors closing. I noticed a mirror, shaking of fright I tried to look in the mirror, I saw a glimpse of a brown suit with a red band around the arm. In my reflection I saw Adolf Hitler. I was certain that my life was about to end, but yet I refused to accept it. Once again I ran out of the bathroom. This time there were more people outside, they were all laughing at me. At this moment I felt nothing but misery and total hopelessness.I think I repeated that process a few more times. It felt like I deserved it for not having the guts to end my own life, I felt like the world would be a better place without me, I despised myself for having the courage to take my own life to make the world a better place.I have no idea how I got out of that situation, but I was put in a room. When the door closed I saw a sign saying “you are at the hospital”. My entire body was filled with an indescribable amount of relief. When the door closed I saw a sign saying “you are at the hospital”. My entire body was filled with an indescribable amount of relief. Everything slowly started to come back to me, I didn’t even have the energy to worry about the consequences, my only worry was how worried my friends had to be, I didn’t get the chance to contact them until the day after.IN CONCLUSIONThis is probably the worst experience I’ve had in my life, and it could have been avoided just by turning off my phone and not going to places that made me uncomfortable.Even if this was a nightmarish experience, I learned some very important things. I think most of the people that use psychedelics are aware that psychedelics should be treated with respect, and that you shouldn’t take them just to see some “pretty colors”, but I also think that a bad trip is almost necessary to really understand the astronomical amount of respect that is needed to safely use psychedelics. I also learned that if I have even the SLIGHTEST doubt before dropping acid, I shouldn’t do it.

I celebrated all night, dancing spontaneously at numerous parties on my college campus, shouting 'here's to humanity, here's to our mother earth!'.  I got blissfully drunk.Once inebriated and back in my dormroom at 4am, I took 3 tabs on a whim.  The duration of the experience happened in this room.The trip was a rollercoaster:  at points I contemplated suicide matter-of-factly (absent of terror and anxiety), while at other points I was seeing a divine eye and matrix overlooking me.For this report, I want to focus on the 'negative' experience, as I think it highlights the possibility for 'unwanted life-changing experiences.'As the LSD came on strong, I was staring out my window.  I saw beautiful trees, greenery, and thriving life (including groups of students merrily walking), but this beauty was CUT and MARRED by the numerous roads and cars streaking like dirty death bullets through my campus.  This led to the realization that I was in the city, deeply desiring a natural habitat but unable to access it.  I have always been a huge fan of human rights.  While not religious, I firmly believe in the human spirit.  This experience undermined and questioned what I thought to be a guiding force in my life.I lost my ego to the force of 'human conquest,' strangling every last living beauty from this earth.  I realized that no matter what I did, there was no way to escape being a firm member of a destructive civilization.  The notion that an environmentally destructive civilization is the 'natural evolution of humankind' became imprinted on my cosmic view.Since returning to baseline, I have re-questioned my unwanted awakening, and do not plan to change my course in life (guided by love for both the planet and humanity).  However, it was a deeply disturbing experience that irrationally stays in my psyche to this day.Here's some unfiltered, free-associated thoughts I wrote down while tripping.  I recommend skimming it, as only a few passages are worthy of keeping, but I am including all of it for a wholistic stream-of-consciousness (note: 'fungus' refers to the exponential human population growth on this planet since the industrial revolution):'ahhh, a further degree of technological relation.  self to self!  mode:  conscious express uninhibited happening.flowing through.  pulsating.  everything is electric!  electrified!To think that this existence, this ability to sit around and take acid, to mobble bobble, all this free time, to think its based off of the industrial revolution....the pillaging and raping of the earth...the species dying, the population rising, two roads cut through like dirt on this computer screen, cringing at my being, two roads cut through what should be all unified grass and green...   oh civilization is a strange thing. Somehow, it really HIT IT when we got MACHINES to start doing the WORK.

Some friends of mine and I planned on going to a festival in late May. This was my first festival and I was quite pumped for drugs and live music. Because I was quite excited and had to work late the night before sleep was something I had little of. We were running a little bit behind schedule but we made it. My friend (we’ll call him Ole) was excited as I was and because he was excited as I was he too had little to no sleep. We struggled to set our tents probably and in the end I am glad it didn’t rain like it was supposed to because my tent totally would have been soaked inside.When I arrived and saw everyone else on various drugs that were going around my first feeling wanted to get on the same level as them. After watching the main band that we went there for it was roughly 12:30 am. During this time my other friend (we’ll call him Sven) had gotten some Oreos that had two hits on each Oreo. We went to our tents and got some more Oreos. I took one Oreo and both Sven and Ole took two Oreos.We sat in the tents, smoked Cannabis and visited with the guy we got the Oreos from. After he left my two friends and I decided to take a walk. My guess is that it was around 1:30 am. I started to feel the affects around this time. It rained quite hard earlier so the night was cool and damp. In my head as I walked through the mud I imagined it as the area labeled between two trenches during WW1 called “No man’s land”. This is a place where I don’t want to be. Not sure why No man’s land was in my head, it could have been the cool and foggy weather which is quite similar to European weather and the mud reminded me of trenches. While I was in No man’s land another feel of worry swept over me. The dark realization came in my head that I was in an unfamiliar place that I have never been to.By this time I would say it was around 2:45 am. I was kind of paranoid of giving my friends a bad trip so I never once said anything about No man’s land or being worried about being in an unfamiliar place. I would about twenty minutes later manage to tell myself to calm down and that I was in an unfamiliar place but it definitely was not a hostile one. I have taken LSD a few times before so I learned the ability control and ease my worried tripping mind.My trip started to turn good at this point. I became mesmerized by the trees as they swayed in the air. The branches seemed to sway in the wind so harmoniously that it was as if I heard music and the branches were dancing to the music. I did notice that someone was playing some electronic music by their tent. This made me laugh pretty hard perhaps because the idea that whoever was playing music had no idea that he was helping in my trip and that amused me quite a lot. We decided to take our stroll towards the outhouses to empty our bladders. I’d say when we went to the outhouses it was around 3:30 am. I stood in a pitch black outhouse urinating while directly at face level there was a hand sanitizer dispenser. Since it was dark enough the only thing I could see was the shape of it. I started to contort faces I saw on this dispenser. I was going between smiling and frowning. In my head after I contorted the face to frowning for about the fourth time I looked a little above the dispenser and there was the most evil demonic looking smiling face with triangle shaped teeth. This face was huge and it took up most of the wall I was standing in front of. I quickly looked down, shaked and walked out of the outhouse. I took a deep breath and said to Ole as I was laughing “shit dude it’s fuckin intense in there”. He agreed as he looked back the stalls (I have no idea what he saw in the stall he went in). We walked around more and at this point we didn’t really have a whole lot to do so we decided to go back to the tent and smoke some more Cannabis.When we got back into the tent we smoked a lot of weed mainly because it was something to do and we had plenty of it. There was this extremely annoying security golf cart that drove right by our tent because we set up our tents right by the path (there were slim pickins for tent spots when we got there). The light flashing was a little nerve wracking. But we learned to deal with it. Ole humorously told me that this is my castle and I have complete control of it. Ole is quite a big guy with a deep voice. As I looked at him looking out of the tent at other people he reminded me of this large goofy medieval general that was in charge of an army that was protecting this castle. It was very cartoon like and extremely funny. We continued smoking and thought it would be funny to shine our flash light at people walking by. One guy with a UN helmet came walking past and he dropped everything and said in a much panicked voice “Im cool man, Im just looking for the bathrooms”. The even funnier part of it was he was walking in the opposite direction of the bathrooms. Right now I can admit that I feel a little bad fuckin with the dude. It was probably the CannabisIt was starting to get light out by now. Ole then assured me that if it rains I will get wet. I am sure it was true and that was something that made me a little uneasy but at this time I was laying down in the tent staring at this red line through on the tent roof noticing that it was getting light out. I knew that this would bring on new hallucinations so I popped my head out and enjoyed looking at the branches while admiring the colors of green in contrast with the whitish gray milky color of the sky. The time then was probably around 4:30-5:00 am.I sat back up and realized that Sven has been a little quite. Right after me noticing that my buddy was being a little quite I noticed that red line on the ceiling of the tent again. That red line distracted me. I looked at this line and noticed that the red inside the line started forming what kind of looked like D.N.A. As I was completely staring at the line I listened to Sven and Ole talk. Sven was getting a little worried about the tent and it not being waterproof. I told him not to worry. I had no reason to give why he shouldn’t worry but at this time I was too enthralled by the red line and honestly didn’t at all care about the rain. Ole assured Sven that it would be alright and he should calm down. Sven then said “no its not, it’s not alright”. At this point t was obvious that Sven was having a bad trip.Ole and I tried talking to Sven again. He was unresponsive. We asked him again still with no response. He was in this total vegetative state for a good few minutes. Ole then humorously said “dude your tripping balls”. Sven then just got this horrible look on his face like he was just rejected by the girl of his dreams or something. We asked him if he was alright. Sven then finally replied “I am just losing my mind”. I humorously retorted “right, isn’t it awesome just relax and go with it” in an attempt to lighten the mood. My eyes were still fixed to this red line and watching all the different shapes flow through it like a river. Ole then looked at Sven and asked “dude are you crying, do you need a hug”? Ole replied with “no, I fucked up”. Okay, I must vaguely explain background of this. Sven has some legal issues and he is essentially looking at 15 years in prison. He thanked Ole for being such a good friend and I thought maybe these negative emotions were leaving him.We sparked up another bowl and Sven told Ole “I get it now”. Ole and I were trying to figure out what he gets but we never really did. He would not respond to the question “what do you get”?  He said it again “I get it now”. We asked again “what do you get”? He looked at Ole with a very angry look and said in a stern voice “why are you doing this to me”! We asked Sven what Ole was doing and he wouldn’t say. I tried to calm him down and I offered him a cigarette. He replied to my offer “no I am turning my life back to Christ”. I knew Sven was a Christian so I encouraged it and maybe thought it would calm him down or at least bring some kind of light in his head. Sven then said “dude I am never doing acid again”. When he said this I had it my mind that it was almost a mission or something of Ole and I to calm him down and turn his trip around. At this point also I stopped paying attention to the time but it had to be at least 6 am and we all were still tripping pretty hard. Sven then proceeded to speak in tongues and call out for Jesus to save him. This to say the least freaked the fuck out of Ole and I. I then said “dude we have been in this tent for way to long, lets go for a walk”.Sven got out first, then Ole and me. When I got out of the tent (which was quite the challenge) Ole told me that Sven stared at him as he was hiding behind a tree right by our tent and then ran away. Ole then started freaking out. He said “dude this is not good, some crazed hippy with his knife on him running around thinking that people are trying ‘to do something to him’”. Ole has some anxiety issues and has told me before that he is a paranoid schizophrenic. He literally thought that Sven was trying to kill him. I calmed him down and we walked around and discussed this crazy situation. Maybe a half hour later we saw Sven being carried away by two Sheriffs and some security while he was screaming on the top of his lungs ”JESUS IS MY SAVIOUR, HE’S IN THE WHITE VAN”!   I had all these thoughts racing through my head. I have no problem with the whole Jesus thing but when it turns into a snitch thing then it’s no so cool. If he spilled the beans in detail Ole and I might get into trouble for harboring a fugitive. I began to panic. All these thoughts were racing through my head. We walked by a tent of some early risers one of them said to Ole and I “hey you dropped something”. We were obviously confused and looked on the ground. The guy then said “your smile”. I knew this guy had no idea of what situation we were in or the seriousness of it but regardless I found my smile again. When he said that the uncontrollable smile I gave felt like a surge going in face then into my brain of utter happiness and relief. In my still tripping mind I told myself whatever happens, happens and there is nothing I can do about it. I can be all freaked or try to enjoy the rest of my LSD trip. This took a lot of will and mental power. I was going to title this report “Triumph of the will” but unfortunately that is the name of a Nazi propaganda film.My buddy Ole on the other hand couldn’t achieve the apathy my brain had towards our current situation. He wanted to try to sleep and asked if he could share my tent because remember he still thought Sven was trying to kill him. As Ole and I walked Ole kept on reminding me what was going on as I was noticing all the tents breathing or looking at some pretty girls. I wanted to just walk around more until the LSD wore off but Ole wanted to sleep as he told me “its time to go to bed”. Being the good friend I am I decided to try to get some sleep. My good friend was tripping and he thought someone was trying to kill him. If it was any other situation where we had two tents and he wanted to stay in mine I would have felt a little awkward. I lay down and tried to sleep. The distractions left and the only thing I had was my mind and my thoughts. I started to lose my smile again and became panicked. I asked for a Klonopin pill that Ole was prescribed to. This helped me calm down but I sure did not sleep. I closed my eyes and enjoyed the patterns that my brain produced. I dozed off eventually.The next day Ole saw Sven sleeping in a cot by the security tent. Nothing happened, the Sheriffs were allowed to be there in order to help security if need be. The park was on private property so it turned out that the police really couldn’t do much. I doubt they even knew of his current legal situation. In the end this trip made me much of a more mature tripper. I have learned that sleep is very important the night before dosing. I will not trip with anyone having something extremely heavy over there head. Sven and Ole were much more mature trippers then I. This experience also has let me learn that even mature trippers can have bad trips. I don’t want to know what kind of hellish crazy world my friend Sven was in but because of what I learned from this event hopefully I will never be there. As freaky as this was this is something now I can laugh about.Exp Year: 2011ExpID: 91651Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 23 Published: Jan 24, 2019Views: 709    LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Nature / Outdoors (23), Festival / Lg.

Don't do it!] I have had one bad trip.  I took an unknown dose on a cube in the woods with my friend. It was dusk when it set in, and it was fairly chilly.  I was prepared for the weather, but my friend was not.  We enjoyed ourselves for a bit, but everything went down hill after we smoked a joint.  All that either of us noticed after the joint was that our ability to concentrate had vanished, therefore destroying any chance of a stimulating mental experience.  Soon after the joint my friend began to worry about the cold, although he could not feel it.  He worried that he would become hypothermic and not realise it in time.  Unfortunately for us, we had no where 'safe' to go, or so we thought, so I ended up driving him around for about 7 hours, until we were both way down and I was about out of gas.  Driving, needless to say, was not pleasant.  Possibly out of a desire to concentrate, or for some subconscious reason, I talked without more than 30 seconds of interruption for the entire drive.  Imagine what that must have been like for my friend.  Luckily there was little or no panic; it was more like time had become a skipping record, repeating over and over without our knowledge.  Slow torture. Later my friend admitted to me that while we were still in the woods he was having deja vu, the setting reminding him of dreams which he had had predicting the day of his death.  I still don't know whether he had those dreams in reality or not, but I'm quite thankful that he had the consideration not to tell me about it at the time, because surely I could not have helped and we would have spiraled into terror together.  I'd like to believe that he was not already there.I believe that if we had both been properly prepared for the weather this may not have happened, but I think the joint was quite detrimental.  Our minds were much more lucid before the pot.  Lesson learned.Never had a flashback.  Just wanted to tell my story.Exp Year: 2000ExpID: 14706Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 5, 2019Views: 941    Cannabis (1), LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Nature / Outdoors (23), Bad Trips (6), Difficult Experiences (5), Combinations (3) DOSE: T+ 0:001 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 2:003.5 goralMushrooms(dried)BODY WEIGHT:250 lbJust a note... I refer to my friends only by the 1st letters of their names.It's a Saturday night, and I had gone over to my friend 'S's' house to hang out with him until the rest of the crew showed up.  It was about 7:00 and I still hadn't had anything for the night.  I had plenty of options, but I just couldn't make up my mind on what I wanted to take that night.Well my friend 'S' scored a hit of acid from one of his friends by giving her a ride to one of her friend’s houses.  Steve isn’t too big into drugs, so being the nice guy he is… He gave it to me.  I’ve never tried acid, so I was kind of excited.  I knew it probably wasn’t going to do much, being just one hit and all, but I still was hoping to feel something.I take it, and waited for about an hour… Didn’t feel anything.  I’ve heard that it takes awhile for this stuff to kick in, but I was still disappointed, so I decided to go pick up a quarter oz of Shrooms for the night.  I take alone with me my friend 'K' because he’s stoned and wants something to eat… LOL!We pick up the Shrooms and head straight back to “S’s” house.  Still not feeling anything almost 2 hours after taking the cid, I decided to munch on my quarter.   About half an hour later I’m starting to feel the effects.  I go out to my car to listen to some music to get things going.  Shortly after I feel enclosed, trapped in my car, so I got out.  It was dark, so I gout out and laid under the stars.For some reason I couldn’t get comfortable, I felt like something was wrong.  In the back of my head, I had a feeling that this wasn’t going to be a fun trip.  I go inside looking for something to satisfy myself with.  Some of my friends are chillin watchin some TV so I watch some TV with them.  No… TV wasn’t what I needed.  So I go into a dark room to listen to some music.  No… Music wasn’t what I needed.  I go back out and am watching TV with my friends and suggest going to the roof.  YES!  THAT’S what I needed!So we go up onto the roof, and by then I’m frying my balls off havin a good time just talking.  My friend 'S' gets a phone call, and that’s where it all goes down hill.  I overhear the person on the other line say that my friend 'E' has been arrested.  He gets off the roof to go inside to talk, and tells me to stay there.  I knew what he was trying to do… He knew what would happen to me if I heard that information on Shrooms, I would have a bad trip.  It was too late though… I had already heard what was going on.I sat there on the roof for like 5 more minutes, just trying to realize what was going on.  I started having thoughts about the police coming over to 'S's' for some reason and finding me.  I kept thinking that my mom was going to show up and know what I was doing.  After awhile, I couldn’t take it, so I went back inside.I went inside, and asked what was going on.  They kept telling me nothing, but I knew what was going on.  I told them to tell me, but they wouldn’t.   They were trying to keep from putting that on me that one of our friends was arrested.  I finally told them that I knew, and they assured me everything was going to be alright.  I kept asking him if the cops were going to come here.  I was scared people were coming here.I felt uneasy, and I started to feel sick. I felt uneasy, and I started to feel sick.  I could tell that that acid had kicked in… I could tell I was no longer just shrooming.  Things were different… A lot different.  I couldn’t get my mind off the fact that one of my friends was just arrested, and that sent me into a emotional head spin.  I kept asking where they were.  I kept asking if they were ok.  Every couple seconds I’d ask if I had done something wrong… If I had hurt somebody or broken something.Finally 'S' gave me an iPod and sent me into his room to try to calm me down.  By this time, I was FREAKING out.  I decided I’d try to calm myself down and relax.  Just listen to music and think about something different.  While I was in there, I was completely lost.  The room was going crazy, and I felt lost in his bed.  The lights were messing with me, and I couldn’t enjoy the music.  I soon threw my headphones off and tried to get out of bed.  It took me a good minute to find my way out.This is when things got really crazy.  This is when I started to peak.  I sat down on the couch, and I felt like shit.  I felt sick to the stomach, and the acid was fucking with my body.  I know I’ve never done acid, but I’m positive it was the acid.  My lips were numb, my head felt like it was going to explode, and my heard was racing and I could feel it tightening.  By this time, I didn’t even remember why I was the way I was.  I kept asking my friends what drugs I had taken, what I had been doing, and where everybody was.I felt absolutely horrible… Terrified, worried, sick, and tripping balls.  My mind was racing, I didn’t know what was going on.  All of my friends tried to help me, but there was no helping me.  I made myself throw up in an attempt to get some of the shit out of my body.  I sat in the bathroom with two of my friends trying to calm me.  Nothing was working.  I kept asking the same questions every few seconds.  Where were 'E' and 'K'?  Are they alright?  What drugs had I taken?  Why am I like this?  When are they getting back?It was horrible.  I just wanted the feeling to escape my body.  I just wanted everything to be gone.  I wanted to be normal.  I finally couldn’t take the inside, so I went outside alone to try to calm myself.  After about 10 or so minutes of thinking alone, I calmed down quite a bit.  I could tell my peak had passes, and that I was going to be alright.  I went back inside to chill with my two friends that were there at the time 'K' and 'G'.  They were rollin, so they were in a dark room listenin to techno with some glow sticks, lol.They asked me if I was alright, and I said yea… I’m feelin better, which I was.  I just plopped down and tried to relax even more.  I still had bad thoughts of cops showing up, and my mom finding out, but it wasn’t as bad.  They really helped me a lot to bring my mind to ease.After about an hour, everybody came back.  They had to leave to go pick up “E” from where he was being held.  As they got back, I was flooded with relief.  I instantly felt 10x better.  At that point I knew everything was alright, and I was going to be okay.  And what made me even happier was that I was still tripping, so I could finally enjoy myself.We all just stayed up all night talking and smoking squares till about 4 or so in the morning.  It was nice… Finally able to let loose and have a good time.  I finally went to my sleeping spot and just laid there… Trying to remember everything that happened that night.  It was really hard, and I couldn’t remember shit at the time, so I just tried to lay my mind to rest and sleep.  After about an hour or so, I finally got to sleep.I have learned my lesson… Never again will I mix or take that much Shrooms.  Never again do I want to feel the way I did before.  Never have I experience as much terror or pain in my life.  I have no intention on tripping for awhile.  I’ve had my fill plus some.  I just hope I don’t get tempted to do it any time soon.  It’s a mysterious world that I just can’t get enough of.  I know I will trip again sometime, I just hope not for awhile.P.S. – I left some of the story out, partly because this is long enough as it is, and because I don’t fully remember that night.Exp Year: 2006ExpID: 56245Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 14, 2019Views: 1,611    Mushrooms (39), LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:004 glassesoralAlcohol   T+ 0:001 hitsublingualLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 7:301 cig.smokedCannabis BODY WEIGHT:122 lbLast night I had an experience that gave me newfound respect for the power of LSD. I have tripped acid and shrooms each about a handful of times scattered over the course of the last 3 years, usually taking care to keep my trips spaced out chronologically so I have time to fully “recover.” I think it takes some time to get reacquainted with reality after a powerful trip. Before last night, the last time I had taken LSD was October 2015 (3 months ago), after having tripped in both May and June of the same year.. all great trips.Last night I had been drinking for a while already and was definitely feeling the effects of that at the time I dropped tab. I will cut to present tense now to make this easier to recount.I’m downtown with my boyfriend and some of our friends, shooting some pool and just kicking back, everything is cool so far. Around 12:30 AM we make the moves to leave and everyone is lingering outside the bar getting in that last cigarette. I make my way back to P, my man, who surprises me by saying he wants to trip tonight, that this girl here was ready to sell him some tabs right now. This is surprising because he has sworn off psychedelics for the last 4 years. Also surprising because it’s generally a hard rule with me that once 1am is on the horizon and nothing wild or compelling is happening, it’s time to pack it up, go to sleep while everything is still good, and not introduce any major game changers to the night such as LSD. I have seen that things can go very wrong very quickly and leave me wondering when that even happened.Mistake number one on my part, as I see it now, was drunkenly agreeing to eat that tab. I firmly believe, ever since my first trip which I found very spiritually transformative, that acid is NOT a “turn up” drug, it is something very serious and heavy on my brain, not just something to party with. I’m also kind of a homebody and definitely just a social drinker, so it being close to 1am and me already a good bit sloshed, I feel like I’ve done my part and I wanna go home and snuggle up with my honey, smoke a doob and go to sleep. But P has other plans and being drunk, I ignore my instincts being drunk, I ignore my instincts – Mistake number two as I know when things start feeling a little hairy, that’s when I need to trust my intuition and do the best thing for myself, which for me would have been the plan I just described.I even tried to pass the tab off to my friend T after having had it on my tongue for only 5 or so minutes, but then changed my mind (to T’s disappointment) because I wanted to be with P while he went through his first trip in a while. Fuck it, I said then, it’s one tab, I have done more than this before and had the time of my life. Why not? Now you know a little about my philosophy on mind-altering substances in social settings, I had to get that out of the way so you understand a little bit the “type” of person I am. From here I can just tell the story. I’ll timestamp according to the moments that had significance to me.12:30AM: P and I eat our tabs standing in front of our bar. It’s been a chill night so far, downtown is kinda dead on a Thursday night but like I said we have a solid group of the homies there with us and it’s been good. We decide to call it a wrap, we wanna go back to his and throw on some records and see where this acid takes us, we start scheming for a ride back to P’s. (A quick note of context, just last weekend I was driving in my car and got t-boned on my driver’s side, so at the point of this story I am newly car-less and have 9 fresh stitches over my eyelid where I got slashed by glass from my window in the wreck. Had I still had my car, I probably would’ve DD’ed my friends downtown, stayed sober, thus maintaining my sense of gut instincts for self preservation and this trip could have been avoided. But anyway.)1AM: P’s buddy C offers us a ride to P’s house on his own way home and we accept, but only after P and I get into a little drunken spat as I realized and vocalized that I really hadn’t wanted or planned on tripping tonight. It’s not as if he forced me to eat the tab, understand I was drunk and feeling a little prissy and uncertain. Spontaneous trips can be great, don’t get me wrong, I just can’t shake off the feel that the odds are stacked against me at this point in the night, and I’m lashing that sensation out on P since it was his idea. So I rip the tab off my tongue and throw it on the ground at his feet (this was also awhile after I had contemplated passing it off to my buddy T) and P points out that it’s already done its damage. And I am truly feeling unsettled, like the way it usually goes when I am on the verge of tripping balls.However remember, I am also drunk, and thinking maybe this queasiness and the fact that I’m feeling a little spinny is just due to all the beverage and the fact that I have already had a long day and definitely not enough to eat (mistake number 3, I wish I never tripped on an empty stomach because while it’s not like I feel hunger in the midst of my trip, I do feel that my body needs some damn nutrition and sustenance if it’s going to endure an 8+ hour hallucinogenic adventure where my appetite usually becomes the last thing on my mind). Plus I feel that I can direct my trip in the way I want it to go by trying not to overanalyze my situation and just take everything as it comes. Of course with this drug I don’t really get a choice, but it still comforts me to think about that in those uncertain moments before the acid makes itself at home in my brain.1:30AM: P and I are at his house, we have made our way upstairs and are in his room, as I still deal with this increasing queasiness and the sense of something being dramatically “off” or not quite right. I often feel this uneasy sensation immediately preceding a heavy trip. When I start questioning myself “am I about to trip, is that what this is?” that is the go-to sign that in a very short amount of time I will indeed be tripping balls. The more intensely uncomfortable I feel in the moments before my trip, the more intensely and vividly I seem to experience the trip itself. So my instinct is telling me this is going to be very intense, because I feel fucking STRANGE.This is like the normal come-up queasiness, but much, much worse. I feel paranoid, skittish, anxious, that I have made a grave error and am doomed to experience whatever effects this tab is going to have on me. NOT good and a very far variation from my normal “keep it lighthearted, go with the flow, try to control your trip by reminding yourself to let go of control” mindset. I’m trying to voice this to P but he is drunker than I, and evidently not feeling the L yet. He keeps saying, “I’m telling you, that acid was junk, you just think you’re tripping and your imagination is running with it.” But I think he was just saying that to comfort me, and really was feeling “off’ too, because of what happens then.~1:45AM: Our friend B comes knocking on P’s door. BANG BANG BANG! All P’s roommates are asleep, we’re both sprawled out having wasted no time getting naked, and now B is totally hammered and appearing out of nowhere on the porch after us parting ways with him downtown. On top of this, B had already been giving P shit earlier that night and they were kind of throwing aggressions back and forth while we were downtown. I attribute this to drunk boy behavior, they have been friends for 7 years, close enough to get annoyed with each other now and then and not fall out over it. So this scared me, when rather than going down and telling B to go home or just asking him to please shut the hell up and offering the couch to sleep on in return (which would not at all be out of character for P):BANG BANG BANG! P and I both: “what the hell?” he checks his phone, the ringer is broken so he doesn’t get notifications, but of course now we see backed up messages from B “you home? I am coming through” “be there in 5” “I am on your porch” etc. Ok, nothing serious, we were downtown together not that long ago so he probably assumed we were awake and just drifted through. But P loses his shit! “Fuck no… after he was being a dick to me all night. My roommates both work in the morning and now I have to explain this shit tomorrow,” etc, he goes downstairs and I hear him SCREAMING. “GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE” and all this horrible shit to B. I can’t even hear B’s answers because P is so fucking pissed and loud. To be fair, B was really being a dick earlier and I witnessed that, but damn. I mean jeez P. Well mission effective, both P’s roommates come out asking questions. Meanwhile I am naked and afraid, if you will, in his room still, ears to the ground trying to decide what to do. I don’t want P to come back up here and me in my frazzled state have to deal with him all angry.Understand this. My sweetheart is as gentle as a lamb. I love it about him, he never would lay a hand on me and sometimes he’s polite to me even when we’re fighting, which is both charming and infuriating. He is a mellow fellow to the core. I can count on one hand the number of times I have seen him truly angry. So for him to have snapped on B like that is totally out of character and I know there is another factor to P’s reaction, and I’m thinking the acid because my nerves are on edge right now too. Without thinking it through I get dressed, go downstairs and slip out the door, which P has just slammed in B’s face. B is bewildered on the porch but I have no explanation for him and just feel the need to flee.My house is 4 blocks away from P’s. I practically run there, feeling paranoid about being alone on the street at 2am, being a 120~ pound female with no self defense experience. My roommates are still downtown together and I know there’s no guarantee at this point that they will end the night at our house. I decide the best thing to do is sleep this off, being that I am still not quite tripping, and as of yet just feeling really unsettled. I slither into bed and pull the blankets over my head. P is calling me, where did I go, why the fuck did I leave, etc, and things start to get confusing. I find myself calling him back but unable to express my feelings or motives for leaving. Instead I say to him, as I realize it myself, “I do not want to be alone for this.” I feel so internally jumbled that I know this is going to be a strange trip. I have exceeded the point of being able to assess my feelings and say to myself “maybe this is just because I’m drunk.” I know with all certainty that this feeling is not normal and I do not want to experience it alone when P is just 4 blocks away. However he does not want to come to me and I hang up on him, frustrated, crying.I realize suddenly I am exhausted – I had spent 12 hours earlier today in the studio, attending my classes and making progress on projects (I am an interior design student) and on top of that had not really had a sufficient dinner, as I had had a class from 5-7:30pm and had gone straight to P’s afterward, where I had begun drinking. So I am feeling weak and glued to my bed. But I know I need to go back to P’s, and the more I think about it, my limbs begin sort of tingling, like I am somehow simultaneously full of energy, envisioning myself running and skipping the four blocks back to P’s, and also excruciatingly tired. Still crying with no explanation, just feeling frazzled, I suck it up and throw off the blankets, change into sweatpants, and made the walk back to P’s. At this point he is not answering my calls. It’s been about 15 minutes since I hung up on him. Knowing his phone doesn’t ring and the door is locked, I might have to just turn around and go back home once I get there, I take my chances.During the walk is when I feel I begin to truly trip. I am no longer afraid of the dark streets or paranoid of meeting strangers here at this hour, being more focused on the appearance of my shadow cast on the sidewalk in front of me by the streetlights. “It’s like I am walking with a friend,” and other vague scattered and disassociated thoughts follow. For a moment I feel compelled to lean against the wall of a house on the corner and stare up at the sky, which is vividly blue and shining bright with stars. I can’t tell if I am cold or not (it’s January). I have the urge to run all the way back downtown, feeling a strangely intense desire to skip down the middle walkway of the city park (which is about 15 blocks away from my house), I envision myself running around the central fountain under the streetlights, riding my bike through the dead streets in the middle of the night. At the same time, I feel as if there is an invisible string tying my forehead to the pavement, pulling me down. I feel like I need to lay down, but that if I lay down, I will be similarly convinced that what I really need is to run around and expend some energy.I keep walking, calling P the whole time, alternately leaving mostly unintelligible messages in which I profess my need for company and plead for him not to have fallen asleep. Reason being that he is a very heavy sleeper, almost nothing will wake him up from a good slumber, I know if he locked the door and went to bed I’m fucked. I’m on his porch and still no answer, the door is locked, the windows are dark. I knock softly three times and sit on the steps to call him again, unsure of how to proceed. Mercifully his roommate comes to the door after about a five-minute period of silence, saying he thought he heard a knock. Thank god, as I was feeling too timid to knock again and had just been sitting there, my thoughts swimming.2:30AM: I go upstairs to P and this is where things turn heavy, as I am grappling with the onset of this strange new type of trip in which I feel the return of that constant ominous presence that lurked over my come-up. I am crying again and P, who has now finally realized the acid was not junk, is cupping my face and snuggling me and only making partial sense. In fact I briefly suspect he is sleep talking and ask him, “are you awake?” which confuses him, so I know he is awake and definitely tripping a little bit. From here on though I cannot describe what he was feeling because I was completely lost in myself.For the next six hours I lie next to P, at some point again ripping off all my clothes as I desperately try to make myself more comfortable in any way possible. I grind my teeth, turn over and over in his bed, and sob endlessly. I remember, at several points, him holding me while I cried so hard I shook, and then we would pause and laugh as he made some crazy observation of his own trip, and suddenly I was sobbing again with no explanation. I remember putting my hand to my face and feeling no semblance of my own face, just rubbery foreign lips covered in leaky snot and tears. I remember actually feeling awed by the sheer quantity of snot on my face, thinking wow, that all came from me, it feels satisfying to cry this heartily. Yet with the exceptions of fleeting observations such as that, it was, in short, awful. In the intervals of P taking a break from consoling me to deal with his trip on his own side of the bed, I keep turning over onto my stitches and am only dimly aware of how painful that really is. I have flashes of memories also from this time period of lying on my back and touching my hip bones, looking down my abdomen at my ribs and stomach and being distracted from my tears for just long enough to question, whose body is this? I didn’t recognize it as my own. I felt it looked malnourished and was almost repulsed. What’s more painful is this sensation:Between the hours of about 3 and 8AM, what I remember most vividly is the feeling that I had accumulated all the suffering and emotional anguish in the world and was tasked with the responsibility of letting every cry be heard what I remember most vividly is the feeling that I had accumulated all the suffering and emotional anguish in the world and was tasked with the responsibility of letting every cry be heard. I felt that I had no choice but to match every single cry of loss and pain that had ever occurred in the history of humanity. The tears just kept coming, I was even amazed at how long I would go on sobbing without taking a breath, until my sides hurt and my cries made no sounds. I had no personal, logical explanation for my tears and yet felt wholly justified in my endless wailing. I envisioned an infinite sea of people- like when you see footage of a music festival and the camera pans out in an aerial view of a huge crowd- and they all saw me too, but that huge crowd was crying in unison, some screaming, some silent and lost in their pain, but just all of these humans crying and suffering, and I felt somehow that it wasn’t enough for them to all suffer individually. I felt that I needed to echo that pain as if to validify it, as if to say, I know you all are hurting, and I am hurting too, just for you. Their pain was my pain, and so it felt natural to cry for so long and so strenuously given that we were all suffering so much in our own private worlds. What I am emphasizing though is that although I knew my crying wasn’t due to any personal factors, it still felt deeply personal. I felt as if I had nothing in this world, as if I had never had anything at all, and somehow had lost everything anyway. It was baffling and agonizing. The overwhelming sadness was too much to take. I remember P asking me numerous times, genuinely concerned, “why are you crying so much?” and my genuine answer, I feel like I want to die.Describing these feelings in Earthly terms sounds pretty grim. The truth is that this feeling wasn’t all scary. Like I said, it felt natural to cry about everything I had lost, everything I had never lost or even wanted, and everything that had ever been lost to anyone. The tears just kept coming as I kept finding new sources of pain inside myself. I wasn’t scared, just tremendously hurt.~8:30AM: I “wake up.” I never actually slept, but large chunks of the night that I spent facing the wall, curled up on my side with my back to P, are completely lost from my memory. I look around P’s room feeling like this is not where I have been for the past 6 hours, I was someplace else, but knowing with absolute certainty that I had not slept. It was as if I had been erased from the physical world while I spent some time grieving for all of humanity in my own private world. What I am saying is I feel like I literally disappeared into my own head for a span of at least five hours. This does terrify me.I unsteadily walk to the bathroom at this point and go pee. My lips feel rubbery and numb; in the mirror I realize I have bitten off lots of skin there while crying. My head is pounding and in addition to the pain in the stitches over my left eyelid, both eyes are swollen with tears to the point it looks like I got sucker punched twice. I carefully wash my face, clean my stitches and spend some time looking in the mirror.Here I experienced something that has happened to me on acid exactly three times before. I look at my reflection and have the sensation of looking at another person, a stranger to me. There is no sense at all of my self residing in that body. I observe my facial features and naked body out of curiosity, totally free from self consciousness. It was unsettling the first time I “left my body,” but I have come to see it as a rare and precious experience and treat it as such when it happens. The harder I stared though, changes began to occur. I felt almost intrusive, in the way it is uncomfortable to openly stare for great lengths of time at someone you don’t really know. Standing before my reflection truly was like standing before a mysterious stranger with whom I felt no more than a distant connection. I looked into “my” eyes and thought things like, “you look aloof but I know you.” And I grappled with the intense strangeness that I was observing this other person from behind her own eyes and she didn’t even know it. It was like my thoughts and the body and face in the mirror were two parts of an equation that you know is true, but just don’t add up.Soon my reflection’s head begins subtly shrinking while her hand, which has come up to rest under her cheek, slowly grows. The result is unsettling and revolting on a primal level and I turn away as my face begins to warp. I have regained only a partial sense of self, I don’t feel at one with the body in the mirror but I know now that it is mine and I will come back to it soon. I don’t need to look in the mirror any longer and see my face distort into something else, now that I feel connected to my face again I find the changes to it personally frightening. Feeling like I have been run over by a train as I gradually “reenter” my body, I go downstairs for a glass of water, which feels like it weighs ten pounds in my hand. I have to lean on the sink and hold the glass with both hands to drink steadily. I leave it downstairs because I am not strong enough to hold it in one hand while climbing the stairs and holding the rail with the other hand. I feel that if I don’t hold the rail, I will either fall down the stairs or float away.P is sleeping in his bedroom. I have the sensation that the bed, which actually is about knee-height for me, is level with my chest, and the far side is higher up, so it’s tilted towards me. P is splayed out on top of it, somehow precariously balanced on this slope. I blink my eyes, the bed is so tilted, shouldn’t he be sliding onto the floor? It is deeply unnerving. I lie down but my head still aches and I am in physical pain, and as I close my eyes my rushing thoughts take over, but there is nothing substantial there, just choppy memories of the prior six hours, and fleeting observations about the night which come together like puzzle pieces. I make a long note in my phone detailing the feelings from the worst part of the trip, as they are still fresh and coming back to me and because, still riding out the tail end of my trip, I know I will want to hear my own words in this state once I’ve come down. It takes about twenty minutes to record everything I want to say. When I’m done I roll a joint and smoke it very slowly, feeling myself gradually calm down and listening to P breathing next to me which I always find very soothing, and he feels very warm. I snuggle up and the toke puts me to sleep until 11am.Now it’s about 6pm of that same day. I still haven’t slept beyond those 3 hours and I feel very bad. My head hurts, my limbs ache, I find that walking feels like floating and sinking at the same time. I have a shift at my restaurant in half an hour and debating how to tell my manager I physically cannot do this right now without losing my job. Oh well. I wonder what was it that made this trip different from all my others. I wonder what was it that made this trip different from all my others. Was it my attitude going into the trip, i.e. “I don’t think I really want to do this right now but I have no choice”? Was it the acid itself? Was it just that the universe decided I am finally ready to open this door into myself, and to see the dark side of acid?I had never had a “bad trip” with acid before this. Only one bad experience with mushrooms that does not even begin to compare to the pain and discomfort of last night. Now I know acid can be life altering and enlightening, but it can also turn me onto some things in myself I would rather not see, and be life-altering and enlightening in that sense too. I am still searching for an explanation, and to fully regain my sense of connection with this reality. I think I have seen all there is for me to see in that particular book and will probably not be doing acid again. I think there is an extent to which it is healthy to separate the mind from the body, the ego from the soul. For every individual it’s a different line. I have crossed that line of my own and no longer feel comfortable leaving my body.Now sober, the note I made in my phone at 8am reads as if written by a crazy person, which I guess it was. One quote of my own stands out to me: “I have felt the pain of everything at once.” After this long-winded story, that sentence alone sums up my trip. I am exhausted. Be safe everybody.Exp Year: 2016ExpID: 107759Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 19 Published: Mar 26, 2019Views: 8,794    Alcohol (61), LSD (2), OBE (332) : Combinations (3), Relationships (44), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:1 hitoralLSDBODY WEIGHT:140 lb[Erowid Note: A substance(s) in this report might be identified incorrectly.

It will be 4 years on 9/10/02. A friend of mine at the time gave me one. All I know it was orange, small, clear and square. So small I didn't think it would fuck me up as bad as it did. I came home from school and dropped it. Making the worst mistake of my life. It was the worst and most life injuring trip I had. It was so scary, I thought I was going to stay like that. I remember as this fact I will come back to later, I went outside at my father's advice. I put my sunglasses on, as my eyes were hurting in the sun. For 14 hours it seemed, I feared for my old mind. It subsided but the trauma had already been done. I had so many more thoughts, but so many more fears afterwards. Well time went on, school was just one big fear. Thankfully I only a 2 classes. Well 4 years passed, on Monday I was again with my father outside I had my sunglasses on, and it occurred to me, 'Do I really need my sunglasses?' It popped into my head when I last thought that, 4 years ago. We were going to home depot and I thought, I can't handle this. This was my first flashback, its been 3 days and I have only felt normal in the daytime and with my family around. But when I'm alone I feel very lonely and panicky. My feet begin to feel numb and my neck begins to hurt. Oh I hope this is temporary.Exp Year: 1998ExpID: 16975Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: May 7, 2019Views: 710    LSD (2) : First Times (2), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), HPPD / Lasting Visuals (40), Not Applicable (38) DOSE:.5 tabletsoralLSD(blotter / tab) 1 tabletoralLSD(blotter / tab)   tablets Pharms - Diazepam BODY WEIGHT:160 kgThis particular trip happene when I was 24. I had previously taken LSD, Native Australian Psilocibin Mushrooms and DMT. I have taken LSD 12 times in my life and the last time was pure hell.Having moved to a new city and without a house, I was staying in a hotel, I took 1/2 a tab of LSD and went to see Avatar in 3d. Which kicked ass, but when I got back to my hotel room I took another whole tab of acid. I had always wanted to trip balls on acid. I had taken 7 mushrooms once and tripped so hard it was like an avalanche. I loved it.But on acid I had never gone to the next dimension. Now I had to chance it. However, my nervousness at doing it built and built until I was lying on a bed crying. People say you should change the music, go for a walk, call a friend or anything else to turn a trip from bad to good. But trust me, when I was tripping balls and waves of panic and fear were rushing through me, I didn't remember these things.I was thinking of suicide when I called the ambulance. I had never even considered suicide before that, and in all fairness I know now that I would not have done it, but the thought just raised my stress and fear level.I was taken to hospital where they gave me valium, which by the way kicked the trip into hyperspace. Waves of exileration rushed through me and I felt fantastic. I realise this was partly a placebo effect. I was afraid and hospitals are safe places where you can be looked after.However, after about 4 hours they sent me home. This was about 7 hours after taking the second tab of acid. The valium knocked me out and I woke up stressing again. It wasn't brought on by the LSD, it was post traumatic stress. It has taken several months for me to feel normal again, but I know I can never take psychedelics again without the fear. Because I know that a small fear will always be there for me.I wouldn't wish the experience on my worst enemy. I should have paid more attention to set and setting.  I should have been in a SAFE place with people I trusted and loved. Alone and in a strange place = hesitation, fear, panic and finaly psychosis.Stay safe.PeaceExp Year: 2010ExpID: 84886Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 24 Published: May 7, 2019Views: 679    LSD (2) : Combinations (3), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Post Trip Problems (8), Various (28) DOSE:1 tablet LSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:150 lbBad Trip?Well I sort of suck at writing shit down, but I had the most fucked up trip ever. When I was fifteen me and my friends discovered this great drug for five bucks a pop, that would get us off for hours.We did acid for a year straight (not every day of course but as often as we could). Doing as much as six hits at a time. Never once did I experience any dragons flying through the sky or mickey mouses trying to kill me. Nothing but good times, hard-core laugh attacks, fun hallucinations, and mind fucks. After awile it became scarce, because I'm from a small town in Ontario. During six months of no acid, me and my family started fighting all the time, because my parents were into church and I was into drugs. I lost my best friend over something stupid, and I was trying to pretend like nothing was wrong. I was trying to forget about everything by not thinking about any of my problems.Acid came back to town. Me and four friends decided to drop, so we each got a hit. Then we walked through a blizzard back to my friends place. As soon as we walked inside and the warm air hit us we started to trip. We went up-stairs in an attic bedroom and started to trip with two other people, who were just smoking weed.The first thing I noticed when we sat down was a red line coming out of Sam's head, going into Pam's head (they were going out). The image of lighter popped out of his head traveled across the red line and into her head, she pulled out a lighter and lit his smoke.The line and the lighter both looked like the red lines in a 3-D book when your wearing the glasses. My first feeling was excitment, but when I questioned them they didn't know what I was talking about. I can't clearly remember everything after this because it was so fucked up, but I will try to explain it as best I can.Everything was very spiritual. Native American spiritual. I kept seeing their thoughts, thinking that it was only us doing it out of the 7 people that were there, thinking that the reason they denied it was, that if they talked about it, it would make them crazy. Then the excitement left when I realized every one could do it. I felt like life was a big conspiracy and I was the only one that didn't know. Every one looked like they had war paint on, but the main one was a fox over my friend Sam's right eye. It was a spirit, telling me riddles and I had to guess them or I would go crazy. I don't remember the riddles, but I do remember feeling every emotion as the trip went on. They would come like a beat. I would feel proud for a certain amount of time then it would change to humiliation for a certain amount of time so on and so forth. Until every emotion was felt, then it would go through them again except faster, by the end of my trip I felt every emotion in about 5 seconds. back to the beginning. The scariest thing about it was that it felt like a big dejavous(I can't spell). It felt like I went though this all before and when I died I would be born again into the same life because I royaly screwed up, and there was nothing I could do to change it. It felt like all my friends  really lived in a spirit world where every minute could be an hour And I was the only one living in my world my untill I did it right. I was left in the dark.Exp Year: 1998ExpID: 13891Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: May 7, 2019Views: 631    LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:90 kgLocation: Sydney, AustraliaMy new flatmate L was playing his first gig at a cool bar. I was keen to turn up and show some support. On a couple of previous occasions, I had 1. Microdosed a 10th of a tab and gone to work. 2. Microdosed half a tab, 3. Taken a full tab and stayed up all night translating the Vulgate into English. I recalled that the full tab of acid didn’t really have much noticeable effect – almost no visuals and the headspace wasn’t particularly different. In retrospect this was probably due to the rapid tolerance buildup of psychedelics (I was unaware of this at the time). In any case, due to my lackluster experience tripping on a single tab, I decided that this time I would take two.I took the two tabbies as I left the house and headed to the bus stop to catch a bus. I donned my “trippercunt sunnies” – diffraction glasses that split light into its component colours. I also wore my most expensive shirt, a mambo “roses” loud shirt that hasn’t been in print for years and regularly sells for over $300AUD on ebayau. This fact became highly relevant the next morning.I quickly arrived at the venue, while still coming up, and rubbed my hands as I looked at the décor: The furniture all was semi-transparent and illuminated from within with many and various colours, purple, pink, blue, red, green. There was also all sorts of psychedelic and spiritual art hanging on the walls. I instantly got good vibes as I knew this was gonna be a kickass trip. I found a seat middle and centre in front of the stage and listened to the opening solo act by HF, who is a regular opener in the Sydney gigging scene. I had invited my other flatmate (little A)’s sister S to come along too, and she arrived during the opening act. We chatted as I was coming up about her new job and my current job hunt and uni studies.Eventually HF concluded his act and my flatmate L and his band mounted the stage. All of a sudden I started getting WILD visuals. My flatmate L has a bit of a hunch, but his lead guitarist was standing tall and straight. It suddenly hit me hard just how short L looked next to this guy. And now that the acid was kicking in, he looked like even more of an oompa loompa because his bass guitar was so damn massive. All of the colours of the lights, the curtains, the stage the walls started popping and jumping. The rug that the band was standing on started to melt and wave and the patterns on it looked like live snake sorta things. I could read every little expression on the faces of the members of the band. L looked so excited and happy that the gig was going well. He kept breaking out into these nervous but happy smiles whenever the crowd applauded. Seemed like I wasn’t the only one having a good trip.I just sat there, shuffling in my seat due to the body load, but not feeling “bad” in any way whatsover. The gig was amazing. The entire show felt like a religious experience. I felt as if I was God, and this band was giving me glory. The fact that so many people gathered together to watch this performance felt as if it had some sort of cosmic significance. As if this is the meaning of life and the pinnacle of human achievement. I started thinking that the story of history is the story of the emergence of God: In the beginning there was nothing, and from that nothing sprung everything, and via evolution, humanity emerged, and with humanity, beauty, truth and goodness. I started to perceive that mankind is on a trajectory towards God, and that final moment of history IS God.These were the utterly crazy theological and philosophical thoughts I was thinking, and they only got even more intense as the next band mounted the stage. This band was hilarious: on the right side of the stage were three really cool looking dudes with badass haircuts, clothing and moustaches, playing drums, keys and bass. On the left side of the stage was this super geeky looking guy playing guitar. His parents were in the crowd and got a shoutout. In the centre of the stage was what I can only describe as a goddess. This girl with a perfect feminine figure, just the right amount of makeup, brilliant, revealing attire that showed off her physical goods and beauty. While tripping hard on the acid, I was struck to the core by beauty and mystery of the feminine form. I felt drawn to it on a deep and profound metaphysical, essential level of my being. Suddenly I was reconsidering my vocation: Do I REALLY want to enter the priesthood (I had been discerning priesthood for about three years and up to this point, was super committed to signing up)? Considering that the mystery of the feminine has captured my heart in such a fundamental way, perhaps this is some sign from God that my vocation actually involves marriage?I continued thinking all these thoughts, and absorbing the beauty of this diva with my eyes as they played their set. The sensation that I was God and these people were here to worship and glorify me intensified. The sensation that I was God and these people were here to worship and glorify me intensified. The visuals exploded. I noticed every little detail that presented itself to me through my five cardinal senses simultaneously.Finally, the headline act went on. I was tingling with excited anticipation as I saw the final band wheel their instruments onto the stage. “Holy fucking shit” I thought to myself, “these cunts are playing a fucking HARP and CELLO!” It was a three piece band, with keys, harp and cello. I still felt like God, and as the weirdly dressed keys player gave commentary and introduced the songs, I got this fascinating train of thought that was something like “Look at what my little people are doing, gathering to offer praise and worship to me. Look at how far they’ve come.”As the harp and the cello and keys started playing, I just lost my shit, in the best kinda way. I could perceive all the infinite microtones as the bow crossed the strings of the cello, as if it were an auditory fractal. It was simply the most beautiful thing I had ever heard in my entire life. And the music was in a slightly sad and melancholy key. The emotions that were being conveyed by the music  were ineffable and beautiful and sad. It felt as if the entire story of history was encapsulated in the song: All the ups, all the downs. The tragedies and the victories. And it just felt as if it was a “movement forward”, as if there is only one direction we can go: onwards and upwards to the heights of heaven.“It just keeps getting better” I remember thinking to myself. “This is heaven”. I was experiencing infinite bliss, but not just infinite bliss, infinitely INCREASING bliss. This beatific vision was completely exponential! And yet the sad notes in the music made me remember. Remember all the tragedies of life and history, remember the holocausts, genocides, rapes and murders. And all of a sudden, for the first time in my life, I was struck with the full force of the mystery of evil. “What even is evil?” I remember whispering to my flatmate L, who had resumed his seat in the crowd. I simply couldn’t comprehend it. I knew from my theological studies that evil has no inherent existence or reality, that it is a complete illusion, and suddenly I realised just how mysterious that is.It just seemed so baffling to me, that here I am, experiencing the heavenly joy that comes from listening to the angelic music of the eschaton, and yet ISIS is out there lopping heads off at this very moment. It just didn’t seem right. Like, of course this is a wonderful moment and I am enjoying it to the full, but fuck; what am I supposed to make of the fact that Hitler did what he did to the Jews? How should I understand this supreme symphony of good, in light of the incomprehensible mystery of evil? These thoughts occupied me all the way to the end of the gig.  How should I understand this supreme symphony of good, in light of the incomprehensible mystery of evil? These thoughts occupied me all the way to the end of the gig. At no point did the trip actually become a “bad trip”, but I started to take on a strong sense of apprehension and anticipation. Somewhere deep down, I realised that tonight was to be the night where God (me) confronts evil and attempts to make sense of it. And I realised that this fundamental interplay between good and evil is what is driving all of reality as we know it.As the gig was over, I exited with my flatmate L and we headed for the bus stop. Now that the supreme beauty of the music had concluded, the trip started to get very confusing. I remember saying to L something about how girls don’t exist, and all girls are evil. I was pondering the fundamental dualisms of masculine and feminine, good and evil, and I was drawing some link between light, goodness and masculinity, and another link between darkness, evil and femininity. I thought of the story of Adam and Eve, and how Eve (the feminine) was the principle which introduced sin into the world. L had no clue what I was talking about, and probably was amused at just how hard I was tripping. I began to distrust him, thinking that he was an enemy in some respect. I hadn’t known him for very long after all.As we got to the bus stop, L called an uber and hopped in with his girlfriend. I decided to walk home. That turned out to be a very bad idea.I walked down the road, still thinking I was God, but this time the thought had a very Christian slant on it. I thought that I was Jesus. I was relating my trip to the gospel stories. I felt as if I had just descended from heaven to earth, and right about now the temptation in the desert was probably due to occur. As I walked home, pondering the mystery of evil, the insanity started to overcome me. It just sorta crept up on me as I was philosophising. It was as if wondering about evil with such intensity was driving me mad.I started to feel as if I am invincible, and made the stupid decision to stop by a servo and buy a supersized energy drink. I started to feel as if I am invincible, and made the stupid decision to stop by a servo and buy a supersized energy drink. I seriously doubt that the massive caffeine and sugar hit had a positive impact. I even realised this at the time, and was thinking to myself “I am going to die tonight. And when they find me, it’s gonna make the newspapers and they’ll comment on how the exact moment where it all went downhill was when I decided to smash an energy drink while high as fuck on acid”.My thinking started to get more and more scrambled. And the thoughts loops got more and more intricate. Eventually I made it to the local maccas and decided I wanted to get something to eat. I stood in front of the touch screen interface where you order your food, but for the life of me I couldn’t figure it out. I kept touching and selecting and there was just something that wasn’t working. At the time I figured the system was bugged, but in retrospect I was probably just tripping really hard.I felt like I was standing in front of that touch screen for an eternity, punching the options and trying so hard to buy something. Notions of “Limbo” and “purgatory” became stuck in my mind, and I felt as if I had failed in my temptation in the wilderness and was being punished with this eternal torture of eternally trying to order dinner and not being able to.Eventually I managed to snap out of it, say “Fuck it” and get out of the maccas. But my delusions of grandeur were multiplying. As I walked through the carpark, I started throwing my wallet and phone away, thinking “I don’t need these”. I felt as if I was living out the most important moment of my life, and it was like “I don’t need a phone. There are more important things. I don’t need a wallet.”I started to feel as if no matter what I do, I can’t die. I felt as if even if I stepped out into the traffic, something would stop me from being run over. I felt as if it was not yet my time to die, and I could therefore do any stupid thing and be ok. This was clearly VERY dangerous thinking. I felt as if it was not yet my time to die, and I could therefore do any stupid thing and be ok. This was clearly VERY dangerous thinking. Following that train of thought, I ended up knocking on the door of two of the brothels. There are a craptonne of brothels on this road. Usually I just walk past them and laugh, but I had always been curious about what goes on inside, and I was in the perfect mindset to ring the bell and find out. I was let in to both of them, but very quickly ferried out once the mistresses realized I had no money on me.I was descending even deeper into madness. By the time I got to the empire hotel, I was thinking about the orthodox “holy fools” of Russia. These crazy dudes who get naked and wander around the towns and villages prophesying. I started to feel as if I was one such holy fool, with a message that could save the world. That idea, coupled with my sensation of invincibility, caused me to unbutton my shirt and cast it off into the wind and the night. As I crossed the road, I dropped my pants and underpants, and kicked off my shoes and socks. I was stark naked, rambling on and on about good and evil, walking around. Thankfully it was a very quiet residential part of town, so I’m pretty sure not many people saw me, but still it was an incredibly wacky occurrence.Eventually I made it home, but I didn’t have my keys on me because I had thrown them away back at maccas. I ended up pacing in loops between my front door and the front door of the house beside ours. My philosophizing was in overdrive. I was thinking about the trinity, dualism, masculine, feminine, the whore of Babylon, the virgin Mary, Jesus etc etc etc.My drug induced insanity just kept getting worse. Eventually, failing to get in to my house, I instead continued to walk around the suburb, and eventually found myself walking in circles around the local catholic church, where the capuchin friars live. The visuals were labyrinth by this point. Not good, not bad, just alien and weird. I was stuck in insane thought loops, and the trip was oscillating between good, bad and neutral. When I was feeling good, I was anticipating that at any point it would head south, and when it headed south, I was holding onto the gospel promise that it’s all gonna be ok in the end and eventually I would return to the good. This was clinical insanity.One common theme that kept recurring was the idea that “the unknown” could intrude into my reality at any time. And I was prophesying to myself as I walked around naked around the church that “yes, at some point tonight, something unexpected is gonna happen that sends me to hell.” Well, lo and behold, as I found myself pressing my naked body against the cold outer wall of the church for some reason, a cop appeared. Soon there were more cops. They asked me what I’d taken. I wanted with all my heart to cooperate and answer their questions honestly, but I was tripping so hard by this point that it was a struggle to communicate with them. They ended up pulling me aside and sitting me down on the concrete, as they tried to establish who I was, where I live, what I had taken, what the fuck I was doing naked running in circles around the local church at midnight etc.I was very much in “bad trip” territory by this point. The cops were relentlessly asking me the same questions over and over again. “Where do you live?”, “Do you have any flatmates?”, “What’s your name?”, “How old are you?”, “Have you taken anything tonight?”At one point one of the male officers laughed out loud and said “He’s the priest!” and I just felt so full of shame, thinking that I legitimately was the priest and was setting a terrible example and letting down the parish and the church and God. Suddenly one of the officers was saying “Look at his passport photo! He looks like a criminal!”. I was so utterly confused, thinking “how the fuck do they have my passport?”After what felt like an eternity of shame and horror, the officers chucked me in the back of the paddywagon and locked me up. I felt resigned to my fate. I figured I was about to go to prison, my family was going to be notified, my life was coming to an end. The ride in the back of the police wagon felt like forever.But wow what good luck I had. When the door of the wagon opened, I found myself out the front of my house, with L standing there at the front door looking sleepy, annoyed and bemused. I hopped out, walked up the steps and went straight inside to the shower.The cops must have been able to accurately extract my address from me during the earlier interrogations on the concrete at the church. One of them had driven over, knocked on the door and asked L to confirm that I live there. L had gone to my room, found my passport and proved that I was a resident. So instead of locking me up for the night they just kindly drove me home. I was so infinitely thankful that it turned out like that, rather than something worse.But I was still shaken up by the experience. As I hid under the covers of my bed, I had to leave the lights on so that I could stare at my clock and verify that time had passed and time was passing. The insanity was wearing off, but I was still terrified that at any time I could discover that it was all a dream, and I was actually in a prison cell or somewhere worse. I remember going down and brewing some tea and holding my head in my hands while praying “Oh God, please tell me it was a dream, please tell me it didn’t really happen”.I managed to rest up a little. When I woke up, I discovered that it was NOT just a dream and it DID really happen, and I knew this because I didn’t have my phone, my wallet, my shoes, or my $300 loud shirt. I had to retrace my steps and literally pick up the pieces. I couldn’t remember where I had dumped all my stuff on the way home, and I had to make use of apple’s “find my iphone” app to locate all my stuff. I ended up finding everything except for my shoes, socks, watch, drink bottle and loud shirt. It had rained during the night, so my shorts and underpants (which I found in the middle of the road) were soaking wet.In the end, I learned so much from the experience, and I don’t regret it. But It was the first time that I realized that bad trips can involve the police, and actual bad things happening, rather than just psychological terror. It was the first time that I realized that bad trips can involve the police, and actual bad things happening, rather than just psychological terror. I have tripped many times since then, but not on acid. This trip taught me that acid is psychologically next level, and 25i-nbome is actually a safer drug in terms of the headspace.This trip directly led to me reconsidering my vocation. After being so utterly fascinated by evil, darkness, the feminine, I figured God might be calling me to move away from ordination and instead investigate relationships with girls again. Maybe I’ll get married? At time of writing (A couple of months after this trip), I’ve picked up a new girlfriend. The future is bright, and even from a bad trip, good lessons are learned.Exp Year: 2019ExpID: 113089Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 25 Published: May 8, 2019Views: 4,850    LSD (2), Police / Customs (60) : Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Bad Trips (6), Various (28) DOSE:  oralLSD(liquid) 1 oralCannabis(edible / food)   repeatedsmokedCannabis BODY WEIGHT:235 lbMeeting God at the HospitalMy very first time taking LSD. I have been an avid medical cannabis user for 8 years now. At the time of the trip I was an undiagnosed recreational user. I had tried shrooms a couple times in the past and had a lovely experience. I do not use tobacco and drink on occasion. 3pm, Summertime, warm and sunny- I biked over to my friends house. Pat gave me a giant chunk of a strong toffee edible. I ate the whole thing and I am very use to functioning on edibles with a very high tolerance. I told her about my experience with shrooms and she grinned at me, pulling out a little vial with a snowman on it. "I'm almost out." She said. "I'll fill this vial up with water and give it to you for free. Don't be mistaken this is very strong, at least 7-8 hits so be careful". (She was wrong).Pat accidentally got a little bit of acid on her skin and asked that I leave before she gets too tripped out. Even though she wiped off the vial, a few minutes after touching it, my hand began to tingle. 5pm- My whole body was welling up with energy. Lights were brighter. I saw patterns on the side walk on my ride home. Stopped at the store to pick up some food and felt as though I was in my own little bubble away from everyone else as I moved through the store, searching for my goods. I'm not tripping yet, this is barely a microdose, mild open eye visuals and changes in perceptions.7pm- I arrive home with some Super Silver Haze and my goodies. I prepare myself a pizza and head to my room. I showed my brother the treasure I found with a beaming smile on my face. I was so giddy to try LSD. My little brother did not warn me that he had his friend over and they were smoking in my room... 8pm- After eating and taking a couple puffs of cannabis, I took the whole vial. Thinking "You can handle this". Big mistake. I will not romanticize this trip. Yes it was a profound experience but had I known what I was bargaining for I would have thought twice and reduced the dosage had I known what I was bargaining for I would have thought twice and reduced the dosage. Pat was very wrong about the dosage. She later admitted it was closer to 10-12 hits. Although some trip reports where the person had consumed 30 tabs is closer to my experience. Immediately, I felt nauseous. I have a weak stomach in general and continued to smoke. I began to feel overwhelmed by smell, light, and sound, as if I were about to have a migraine. I asked my brother to turn down the War Pigs by Black Sabbath. He and his friend refused to do so and became belligerent at this point. I did not imagine this and they often would act out so I had to kick his friend out. No one is going to smoke my weed and disrespect me. 8:15pm Within minutes my entire visual field was covered with swirls and patterns, bright flashing lights. The carpet in my room expanded, my room became huge then disappeared entirely. I was in a cave of visual, swirls, patterns, and lights. The music sounded far away like I was in a tunnel. I could no longer function, I forgot I took a drug, I could no longer remember anything. I accidentally drank bong water thinking it was a bottle of sparkling water. I remember becoming extremely hot and taking my clothes off.I had a very bad headache and voice in my head said some unsettling things. Specifically, that "MY BODY IS ATTACKING ITSELF" I decided to lay down and try to sleep it off. This was another mistake. I thought I went to sleep. I was very convinced I was sleeping in my bed but in reality I went unconscious. My sense of self was asleep but my body was still moving and acting on its own. My sense of self was asleep but my body was still moving and acting on its own.  ****The rest of this trip is pieces of memories that slowly came back to me and bits that other people had to fill in for me. As I stated above my self went to sleep but my body kept moving****I think this may have been a psychotic break. I became very afraid of my house. I think due to bad memories or the fact that a lot of people have died and suffered here. You can feel it in the walls. Whilst still naked, I ran outside to my friend's house and started banging on the door screaming her name. I laid down on their porch looking up at the stars. The whole world was moving and shifting. Creating cliffs and breaks in my once flat city neighborhood. The Earth was splitting apart. I could see giant cracks filled with nothing but dark empty space. Earth shattered. My friend's Dad came outside and I ran away from him. Stumbling a couple times. My brother tries to get me back inside the house but I refuse screaming "I hate this fucking place, I'm not going in there!". I started saying awful things about my neighbor that "he was beating his wife" when in reality he is a really nice guy. Always cool and friendly. The police were called of course. I was very lucky they didn't beat my ass. The detective, unfortunately, was the same detective who was there the day my father died. I felt very uncomfortable and tried to run away again but was caught in a blanket by another cop. Sitting on my lawn, I looked up at the cop and tried to grab his dick. He dodged me then I immediately said "I'm sorry officer" giggling like a mad woman. Looking back, I'm so sorry for what I did to you, officer. I did not mean it and I'm very ashamed for assaulting you. An ambulance came and the paramedic looked like a fat old version of a woman I disliked. I again tried to run but she grabbed me by my hair and yanked me into the ambulance. I started talking shit to them and the nurses. Saying thing I would normally never say had I been sober. We arrive at the hospital. They inserted a catheter in me that later became infected. I was restrained so hard that after I woke up my pinky was purple from lack of blood flow and had no feeling. I said horrible, awful, hurtful things to the nurses who laughed it off but also instigated at the same time. I'm gone again. The staff become malicious and throw me into a blender. I felt the blades chop me up starting from my right leg up. The whole room goes red like the sun. I'm pretty sure I'm dead at this point. Then I hear a voice talking to me. "This isn't where you are supposed to be right now." "Pick your guitar up and keep playing, you'll get good, if you die now how are you going to do that?" I'm pretty sure this is God. Whatever this being was, it knew me and all too well. "What about your grandpa? Your brother? Your mom?" After God said this I began to see flashbacks of memories. Past, present, and future began to meld together. I saw everything. God said I'll get a second chance and to be kinder to the people in my life. I received words of encouragement and then after the last memory of my grandpa and signing off on this deal I returned. I "woke up" or my sense of self did. I was in a white room. I was 100% sure this was purgatory. An Asian man wearing white stood in front of me looking as wise as Buddha. He asked "How are you feeling, are you awake?" "Where am I?" I asked. "You're at resurrection hospital."I had no idea where I was or how I got there. How did I end up a mile from home? What are clothes? Where are my clothes? The nurse proceeded to get me some food and water and encouraged me to stay away from drugs. Not likely but I thanked him and apologized for how I acted. I was still tripping but at least conscious. The walls were still covered in sacred geometry. My mom picked me up and took me home. Grilling me over where I got the acid from. I wouldn't have called this a bad trip, the experience itself while terrifying was still breathtaking and mind warping. However, this is a bad trip because I had unintentionally hurt people in the process because I lost control of myself and that's my only regret. I still enjoy LSD occasionally but I'm very careful about my dosage, environment, and make sure to have multiple sitters to prevent any mishaps. I still enjoy LSD occasionally but I'm very careful about my dosage, environment, and make sure to have multiple sitters to prevent any mishaps. I so truly wish I could enjoy this substance in a medical setting where it would be safer but that's not going to happen anytime soon. The last thing I'll say is remember the beginning of my trip where a voice told me "Your Body is Attacking Itself"? It turns out I have autoimmune disease. 3 of them. During that trip I believe I had a Grave's Disease flare-up that possibly contributed to my actions and adverse effects. It may sound crazy but the voice was right. I always learn something new when I take LSD. Its true that psychedelics provide valuable insight. If I never heard that voice I would have never taken the steps needed to get my AI disease diagnosed and under control. In a way, it did save me.Exp Year: 2014ExpID: 112810Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 18 Published: May 11, 2019Views: 1,205    LSD (2) : First Times (2), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Therapeutic Intent or Outcome (49), Bad Trips (6), Various (28) DOSE:1 tabletoralLSD(blotter / tab)   repeatedinsufflatedKetamine(powder / crystals) 3 hitssmokedDMT(powder / crystals)BODY WEIGHT:140 lbI was in a valley town of West Virginia for a small scale psytrance/glitch-hop/chillum-smoking-barefoot-hippie-junglist type festival. I had an awesome group of friends with me and a colossal bag of kitties. It was the second morning and I was sitting in a circle of people at our campsite, dazed by K and the night before when my friend, let’s call him A, inquires we all eat some LSD and is met with a unanimous “yeah sure why not whatever”. Pieces of paper are then handed around the circle, each one a big generous strip. I get one that looks like a good 4 or 5 hits and I mean this shit is good. Newbies could split these buggers in half and experience a solid first acid trip. There were the typical post consumption giggles going around, and that slightly awkward undertone of a collective psychedelic come up. Eventually everything starts to look greener, I see small kaleidoscopes bursting in the overcast sky and my mind starts to bend. It was wet, cold and raining in the Appalachians. I took a bump of ketamine and felt warmer. One of my friends starts to blow up one of these weird alien glow balloon things that he got from a vendor, and as it inflated he would pull it away from his face and look at his progress every so often, and then giggle at the half deflated alien in a state of balls-tripping. This went on for 30 some minutes until there were several glowing aliens hung up around ours and our neighbors campsite. It was hilarious, but my own trip had kind of a weird undertone to it that I can’t exactly explain. I felt detached, but not just from the K. Like I was separated from my peers on a different level than everyone else. After an hour it became more difficult to speak, I could only belly laugh and smile, or answer yes or no questions. I took a bump of K and we went to the first show of the day. I was watching this chick hula hoop, and she was honestly one of the best hoopers I’ve ever seen. Doing some crazy fucking shit with her body that was really impressive. She just flowed together so well I couldn’t take my eyes off her. I was getting these streamers of light where her hoop had been and they formed geometries making me visualize how well a perfect geometrical shape such as a circle can wrap around the human form. Kind of like how poi forms triquetras and what not. I went under a blanket and did another bump of K, then I lied down. My body melted into the earth and the sky was so many colors, while in actuality it was just gray. After several minutes of the laying in the grass, staring at the sky with the bass hitting my eardrums, I saw the sky start to “tear” with white light. Eventually it opened and I saw something like pic related. The light around it was too bright to see clearly, but it was incredibly vibrant and colorized. What was strange was that it just sat there, it was not like an entity it didn’t try to contact me. It just was. I wasn’t catatonic. I could still walk, and talk if I needed. But there was this great big Mayan sun just accompanying me. If I was slightly crazier I’d have thunk “ALIENS!”Eventually I said “FUCK IT, I’M WET” and hobbled back to the campsite with two or three others. We sat there in mostly silence, too in awe with the visuals to speak more than a sentence or two at once. My mind started to wander and I began to get anxious. I had to pee but couldn’t fathom how I could get up and actually DO it, you know? So I just sat there. This continues for an hour before we went to the next show, which was Thriftworks. He makes weird glitch-hop. We get to the tent and we all sit in front of the stage, and then my mood goes from “meh” to overwhelmingly negative. Every time someone laughed, it was at me. Every time someone spoke quietly, it was about me. I felt naked in a crowd of people. I didn’t know what to do. Every time someone laughed, it was at me. Every time someone spoke quietly, it was about me. I felt naked in a crowd of people. I didn’t know what to do. Eventually I realized that I was crying. I go up to friend A, who gave me the acid, and I say to him “dude, this L is WEIRD man.”He sees something’s up and tells me “no it isn’t man let’s go for a walk” and immediately stands up and motions for me to follow him. Everyone else stayed behind.As we’re walking I pour my heart and soul into this kid. I tell him that I’m kinda depressed and yadda yadda personal shit, my brain’s fucked up and psychedelics have been amplifying that lately. Giving me social anxiety and extreme paranoia. Borderline schizo. I’m losing it. Eventually I feel a lot better and we go back to the show. Everyone acts super happy to see me and asks how I’m doing, it felt really good. I couldn’t have asked for better company in that state of mind. After Thriftworks we went straight to Shpongle. I bumped more K and grabbed my DMT from the campsite, and then we waited in the crowd for Simon to come on stage. Shpongle has this amazing ability to start his set without a word of welcome, push some buttons that make the speakers go “DONNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGG” and then 60% of the crowd lies down and I’m just standing there like “what the fuck is going on and what is that smell?”It was around the 6 hour mark of the acid trip, and I had been in a K-hole for two straight days. So I figured as Divine Moments played it was as good a time as any to blast the fuck off. I loaded up my little deem pipe and took three tokes, my vision went somewhere else and all I could see were patterns. The randomness of the visuals seemed oddly allegorical, like a reincarnation pattern or less specifically just a broad representation of chaos. Such is life. I came down like a feather through the air, and found myself grinning with the fruit of psychedelic reassurance. DMT always makes me realize that everything is okay and I worry too damn much. I owe who I am to that compound.After that it was kind of just a blur of Ketamine and nitrous until I passed out in my tent. Thanks for reading!

Don't do it!] Alright. I'll give you a story. It was early fall about three years ago, and early as well in my LSD experience. The novelty of it had not quite yet worn off. This is the night that made my naive beginning of my 'LSD honeymoon' not so new. I had aquired about 30 hits of blotter. They were cute. They were named ufo's, and as I sat in my truck that sunny afternoon I found the tiny microscopic alien like spaceships that decorated the paper--- irresiestable. hmm. So I popped 4, admired the look they gave my tounge in the rear view mirror and flipped them around inside my mouth as I went to meet up with some kids who wanted to get some tabs. Well, when I got there I saw about 6 kids just standing around waiting for me. This was more than I had expected. In fact, more than twice as many. I'll give out some simple 'names' to make it easier to under stand. These kids were aquantances in a small community that I lived in. Yes. very small. Basically, I sold a five strip to Bob, Joe, Demi, Kate, and 2 hits to Mac. And accepted their plans to just drive up to the beach and chill all night with a nice bag of weed and the stars.Now that sounds nice, doesn't it? So apparently Bob and Joe took irresponsible amounts because they are just stupid. They had little to no experience with LSD and they each took 4. I made sure my friend Katie took two. I had already dropped, so we went to go pick up a friend in Joes car. Joe dropped after I had left my truck parked at my house. The plan was: go over to the next town to get a bag o' weed. I was stuffed in the back of the car with a nice view out the rear window. Tripping.My artistic mind took over and I suddenly found myself stuffed in the back of a car with a nice view of the inside of an electronice star spangled universe. The back of the car had dissapeared. umm.. because I looked at the stars and they had replaced the back of the car. My whole body left trails down the road and off into the night. I lowered my head, to see patterns unfolding in the most amazing simplicity inside my eyes as I closed them. Yes. The vibrations of the car echoed in my body and I didn't even have the mental space to realize 'I'm trippn' face.' Which was why I didn't stop to liten to my senses screaming beneath my drug induced state: this is sketchy. Abbi-- there are 8 people piled into a small car that feels like it's going to fall apart. And You're tripping. And almost everyone else is tripping or is going to be tripping. We made it to town. And I forgot my internal warning. Got the bag. Went to the supermarket ( yeah, there were triangle gashes pulsating off of the clerks face..hmm. goldfish on the bag became my new freinds ), and proceeded to drive up to the remote end of the island.Ah.. how remote. 8 of us. Tripping ( except for 2 girls ), on the beach. If I knew what was in store for me down that path that led to the water I would have turned around long ago. My friend Katie was tripping for the first time. SHe was the real reason I was there. We both sat down on the beach, it felt so good. The clouds separated from the sky and made in my imagination. Everyone was so happy. Smoking. Happy... ahh...a few hours passed and as I sat in the car with Katie, talking and ranting and just being crazy--- I had this horrible lurch in the pit of my stomach. I wasn't peaking anymore. It had been almost three or fours hours since I dropped. Indides of the car pulsating... I reacted to myself and immediatley called everyone. I got there attention. They all slowly came up and we all piled into the car. Except for joe. because he wouldn't get into the car! We would get him in and he would start mumbling about puzzles and sound like some alice and wonderland shit. I was highly sensetive and I started thinking that he was doing this on purspose ( since I was still tripping and trying to drive his car to get us all outta there and take people home ). He did all this stupid stuff, honking the horn and opening the door and letting himself fall out. His friend mac came to me and said that joe was not acting like himself ( well, obviously! )Joe was also not responding to us. We did get everyone in the car. And I drove. Until Bob started ranting about having to get out of the car 'OUT! OUT!!!!'.So I pulled into a field by a lake. I didn't know there were houses around. Joe stopped responding to us. He just sat. he wouldn't get in the car once he got out. Bob had changed to. He was getting very aggressive and pushy, he soon began yelling.I was worried, because he was getting violent. I kept Katie by my side as Joe sat in no response, and Bob ran around. I felt worried. I told a sober driver to use joes car to bring home the remaining people. Mac went with her. By the time she had returned with the car. Bob was yelling about 'YES! the elite race! We don't need to sleep we can just stay awake all the time! No food! NO SLEEP!!!'Yeah. sure. if we all ate acid all the time. The novelty was wearing thin. I was tripping! My thoughts wanted to stay as far away from this situation and the police as possible. Bob was getting violent, grabbing my body, and digging his finger into my skin. And Joe just sat there. My house was right through the field. I told Mac to stay with Bob and Joe while the girl and I went over to my house to get my truck. It was BOb we were worried about. He was being loud and violent. We needed to get him home. or calm him down ( but he wouldn't co operate with our attempts to get him into the car ).Just then. Mac appeared at my house. 'The cops just arrested Bob.' He said. Obviously joe was arrested. and we still had joes car.well. Bob had puched a cop.That's my worst experience EVER with LSD. WORST! Because I was left feeling ignorant about selling drugs to kids who didn't know any better. If I had been in a more sober and less analytical and selfish ( sorta ) state of mind I would have just called the parents right away. Since these kids were my aquantances... I felt responsible to not just leave them alone bugging out. This is a situation that did not need to happen. Being informed not only has to do with the doses, the timing, the weight.. etc... But also the setting, who you are with, and what the circumstances are. Drugs should be experienced in quiet, calm, relaxed, small, thoughtful settings. This whole experience was in vain.Be safe. Be careful. And Listen. Is the only advice I had for myself as I sat in the bathtub at 4am still tripping and smoking a bowl. Pondering the water, and the pulsating porcelan, I kept on realizing over and over again how good the acid was ( too bad for bob and joe ). aggghh... LSd is beautiful, mushrooms are even better. And weed is just an herbal supplement for sanity. I was so happy to be sleeping after everyone had gone home or been arrested.

This had NEVER happend to me before.I went to the Ultra Music Festival this year for the first time. I went with my ex BF and his friend. I have done E a millions times (well not a million, but alot..hehee) before and I had done acid about 4 times before and candy-flipped once before this. My first experience with acid and E together was an awesome experience so I excepted this one to be just as good....WRONG!We were in the hotel room and took the E & the acid at about 7:00 at the same time (not smart, I know, but I didnt want to get searched at the festival). Then my friends had the bright idea of taking the acid too... I had a bad feeling about it and I had been anxious all day but I wasnt going to be the only one NOT tripping later on so I took it at the same time.We get to the festival and about 30 minutes after dropping both I start to notice some effects. I remember looking at the grass and it seemed to look 3-D-ish. Then the Nausea came... The nausea continued and seemed to get worse. I told myself it would go away that it was just hitting me so I tried to enjoy myself. My visuals at this point are there but not extreme. I feel no empathy whatsoever, I actually feel kinda not happy and just mostly nauseous. I shake it after about 2 hours and try to walk around and have a good time. I kept feeling almost lightheaded. The nausea never fully would go away but it would subside long enough for me to try to feel good. I remember sitting on the grass with everyone and the clouds were going by so quickly like smoke almost, and the skyscrapers kept changing patterns and almost looking like they were going into themselves and then back out. I was like that for about 5 hours, I couldnt seem to feel the E at all. Maybe just a smidge of tactile stimulation and clenched teeth. So the bad part begins....it been about 5 hours...We go to see rabbit in the moon perform, and mind you I havnt ever been to ultra or seen anything like this in my life. It was so intense, with the crazy guy with the suits and the visuals on the plasma screens. The end of the show I started to feel hot, then hotter, then a bit claustrphobic, and nausea really bad. I told them I had to go they could stay but I had to leave so finally we started to walk bad to the hotel. WE GOT LOST! I started to panic and panic more when no one else was! I felt hot, and so sick, and the more I walked the worse my visuals got. I remember thinking if I could just get back to the hotel I'll be ok. I felt dizzy, lightheaded I thought I couldnt go on, I felt something wasnt right. When I looked around the buildings were all swirling around and everything looked like it does when ur walking with a video camera, know what I mean? I got to the hotel and fell down onto the couch, my heart was racing uncontrolably so I started to freak more, I needed to get back to hotel room. I told my ex but he told me I was just dehydrated, he wouldnt take it seriously, I got more worried.I got to the room and kneeled down onto the floor in front of the toilet and started dry heaving, I couldnt throw up or getting anythngn to come up. I started to totally freak and knew something was very wrong, my ex told me to take a cold shower, I tried but I couldnt stand up, I was too dizzy and nauseous and lightheaded. I sat down on the floor rocking back and forth thinking that I was going to die or go crazy, I couldnt believe this was happening to me. I told him to take me to the hospital, but he said that I didnt need to go and that it was just a bad trip that it would go away. I thought to myself, that I was going to be a statistic, I'm going to die right here!I was upset and thought to myself that what an a**hole, u dont wanna take me to the hospital! I felt afraid, I was in Miami, where was the hospital? I was confused and thought I had no hope even if I did call 911 myself. I was in a hotel room and it wasnt clear EXACTLY where I was. So I did not know the tv was on and at this point I thought I was hearing voices. Everything in my visual sight was swirling around moving, and every time I closed my eyes I saw the rabbit in the moon show, lights, people. My heart raced, I was dizzy, hot, nauseous, afraid and I kept trying to talk myself out of it but it was no use. It was too strong. Something was not right. I kept guzzling water but it didnt matter. Finally I lay down in bed with my ex and he was trying to talk me through it but no use. I took 5 ativans to come down an kept saying over and over that I would never do this again that was never going to do this again. Finally all of the sudden, I had to throw up and NOW. I leaning over the side of the bed and threw up like I had never thrown up before. So badly I could barely get a breath. The strange part.... After I was finished, I sat up, stood up and smiled and said 'I'm gonna be ok now, I'm GONNA BE OK NOW!' he laughed at me and after that I raved the rest of the night, felt fine and didnt go to bed till about 7am. I didnt come down for 12 HOURS! WTF! I'm still not sure what happened to me.

My mindset was in a good place and I was doing it in my trip sitters room. We ended up doing it one day earlier than planned.7:00 We wake up, relax, do some pre trip preparations like getting water and some food up to the room. We opened the curtains so I could see the trees and clouds outside easily and got the headphones with the music prepared. I listened to a playlist on spotify called psilocybin for depression, which was made for trips like these. We also drew up the time graph so I could easily see how high I was.8:00 I ingested the tabs. I put them under my tongue for 15 minutes and then swallowed them with some water. The first effects started to come about 15 minutes after I swallowed the tabs when I started to see faces on stuff that I looked at and everything had a slight hazy purplish contrast. Time was already moving incredibly slowly. Everything just seemed super comical and it was very easy to laugh. Then I looked up at the ceiling and it seemed to be warping a lot. My friend told me to relax and just go with it, so I did. Some time around 9:00 I had my first real kinda vision. There was a lot of green light, knives and razor blades constantly chopping at my throat. I reached out for my friend and he grabbed my hand and everything seemed to go a bit better. But the knives and razor blades never stopped. When the song I was listening to ended (can’t remember which song it was), it felt as if I had needles running through my veins on my jaws it felt as if I had needles running through my veins on my jaws, and when I looked down at my arms and legs they were literally withering away in front of me, like I was getting old. It looked like I had some big mark branded in on my left arm but I was never able to see what it was. My friend helped me over to the chair at the window and I looked up at the clouds. They were rapidly morphing, but I could clearly see a dragon holding some kind of symbol in its teeth but I couldn't make out what the sign looked like. I looked down at the table and saw a Rubik's cube. At this point it felt as if my whole life was that Rubik's cube, and I needed to solve it. Every algorithm hurt like knives and needles on my throat, but when I was done, nothing happened. I seemed to see faces inside the cube itself, but I didn’t know who’s face it was, or if it even was a face.10:00 It felt as if I had been through an eternity, if not several eternities. I had more visions, but I do not recall exactly what happened in them, just that there were a lot of knives and needles and razor blades. At one point there were a lot of razor blades chopping down at a tube that I took to be my throat. A voice said “just go with it” and everything that existed got sucked into a kind of black hole and I woke up. My friend next to me was bubbling and transforming into a lot of things, but I remember clearly holding his hand as he turned into the devil himself. I squeezed his hand to try and get the devil out of him, I squeezed as hard as I could, but in the end I gave up and fell down again. It felt like the whole room was melting, and I saw as plastic started to melt and drops of plastic started to fall off a box in the room. Then I lay down and let  everything embrace me again.11:00 or 12:00, I don’t remember exactly, is when the spiders and snakes started to come into play. My skin was crawling with tiny spiders that bit open my skin, crawled out, and made a new skin for me and crawled inside again. At this point according to my friend I was vigorously shaking and looking terrified. I was terrified, but I had no idea I was shaking. I was in this state for about 30 minutes. My friend fell asleep for a bit, and afterwards he was still holding my hand as I was shaking. At one point I asked for a break and paused the music as I needed to go to the toilet. I had an intense fear for a little while that something was in the bathtub, and when I looked in the mirror and I could see inside myself as I melted away. On the comedown at maybe 13:00 or so we had to go over to my house to take my dogs for a walk. We walked downstairs but it was hard as the very ground was shaking vigorously, like it was breathing heavily. Well outside the shaking and such seemed to calm down. I took my electric scooter and my friend walked and we went slowly towards my house. To start with I had this horror type contrast, and a crippling fear that someone was behind us, but once we walked onto a path that goes through the trees that fear dissapeared. Now I was communicating with the trees along the path. They all had something to say, some were old, some young, some had scars on them and they all had many faces. Some were happy to see me, some wanted me to go away. Some just wanted to leave themselves but they were stuck in a bad area. Some were dead and very quiet, some were unwilling to speak but I could sense what they felt. The trees seemed very interested in me and I was interested in them, but I did not ask them any questions. The trees seemed very interested in me and I was interested in them, but I did not ask them any questions. At one point I was inside a root that was close to the path, but when I tried to get out of it, I couldn’t. During the whole walk, I felt as if I was some super intelligent being, and my friend was just a mere mortal who had no power whatsoever. When we arrived home to me, we quickly realized that we didn’t have a key to get into the house. I went around the back to see if a door was open, and around the back everything seemed dead and decayed. Flies everywhere and dog shit lying all over the gravel. There was no way in, and I could sense that my dogs were close to me. So we decided that we would walk back, along the same path so I could talk to the trees again. But on the way back the trees weren’t as talkative, and I realized that I was kinda having intense visions of knives and needles as I was walking. I was vaping as well on the way and I could see faces in the vapor, but they dissapeared so quickly that I couldn’t examine them. We found a comfortable looking bench and we sat down, and my friend asked me what I felt about eating meat. I said that I didn’t know. He then said what about the animals, and I felt every insect, every plant and tree, everything was alive, and I almost started crying and answered I don’t know again. Off in the distance, the clouds looked like the clouds from the intro in the Simpsons and this made me feel slightly happier. We continued walking and we came to a playground, and we sat on the swings and I closed my eyes. More knives, needles, spiders and snakes, everywhere, everything. I put on the same playlist with my headphones and we started to walk. It felt as if I was being told to go somewhere. There were signs on the road and in the grass that led me to a specific place, but right before I got to it, my friend told me to follow him and go a different way. I still had knives and needles on my throat as we walked. We came to a small playground and we sat on one of those double spring swings and I closed my eyes, but I couldn’t really get into it. I got a glimpse but I felt like I needed a more relaxed area. So I told my friend that I wanted to lie down and he showed me some areas where we could go but I felt as if they were to open, and people would see us. I took him to a bird nest swing that was close by and I lay down with my music next to him and closed my eyes. So many needles, knives, spiders, snakes, spiders turning into razor blades and cutting me open and I couldn’t do anything about it. The tree in front of the swing was communicating with me throughout but I didn’t understand it, and the clouds were shaping Egyptian type figures. When I woke up again I felt as if I had been there for about 2 minutes or so, but I had been shaking for almost 30 minutes. After this we went shopping for food cause we were super hungry. We ended up buying a big sausage and 2 energy drinks. We went and sat on a bench close by and started drinking the energy drinks. I had an urge to talk to somebody else that wasn’t my friend so we texted another friend and it was relatively pleasant, however the energy drink going down my throat felt like needles so it kinda ruined it. We continued walking home towards my friends house and everything was slightly brighter now. When we walked in, we went up to his room as to not disturb his family who were downstairs. We watched kung fu panda and I was continuing to have mad CEVs while watching it. It must’ve  been about 15:00 at this point and the needles were not going away. After a little while we went downstairs and started playing smash on his Nintendo switch. I got mauled twice in a row, and I felt as if he could predict every single one of my moves which was very strange. After 2 games we watched an episode of family guy, but it just made me feel super uncomfortable, to the point where the cushion I was leaning against felt like needles to my head. We ate some noodles and watched Arrested Development instead which was way better. After probably an hour of watching, my friend started making dinner for me and his family. He was using the sausage we had bought and it made me feel great that we could finally eat it. After dinner I sat down on the sofa again and played on my phone, while still having needles on my head from the pillow. At maybe 19:00 or somewhere around that I had to go home again, but I was still knee deep in the experience. I scootered and my friend cycled home with me. The ground was still shifting so it was still kinda hard to travel straight. When I got home my friend left to go home and I was alone with my unknowing family. I said hi to my family and then I went downstairs to my room to try and relax, but it did not even slightly work. I went outside for a walk to communicate with the trees again and it was pretty relaxing just to walk around the bushes. When I got back inside there was still no way for me to calm down, so I had to go outside again. This time I took my dog with me and I went over to a big rock in the middle of an open field next to a relatively friendly tree. I sat there next to my dog and closed my eyes but I couldn’t relax. Some guys were smoking weed about 20 meters away from me so that didn’t help me whatsoever. I walked back home with my dog with a slightly scared feeling. When I got home at about 23:00 (T+15h) I laid down on my bed and turned on the music and ended up having another 4 rounds of visions  with a lot of knives and needles but no spiders this time. There was a tree that tried to help get rid of the knives and needles but it couldn’t help me, so in the end I couldn’t get rid of them. After those 4 rounds I couldn’t stand it anymore so I watched about 4 episodes of Arrested Development and then I fell asleep, even though my pillow felt like needles. The next morning I felt pretty positive but I couldn’t figure out if it was a good or bad trip. Thinking over it now a little later it probably was a bad trip. Shaking, being constantly terrified, needles and knives and spiders and snakes, and no resolution. I’m not entirely sure what I should do now, but I guess I'll find out in due time.Exp Year: 2019ExpID: 113377Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 16 Published: Jul 17, 2019Views: 697    LSD (2) : Entities / Beings (37), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:3 tabletsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:170 lb[Erowid Note: A substance(s) in this report might be identified incorrectly.

Although the report is included in the collection, the substance might be something other than the author believed it to be.] Dead, and do not know what to doI have had some pretty impractical experiences throughout my life relating to LSD, but yesterday December 10th is a day I will never forget, and I (for the most part) usually have the time of my life when I take LSD, the fact that reality is changed right in front of your eyes so vividly is very interesting. I do not know how believable I can make it sound, because I am not that good of a writer but I feel I should try to tell you my story. I can say that I could have planned out the day better, but still…… I do not think I will take any blotters for some time.Me and my friend started talking about it out surfing one day and decided we hadn’t gone on a journey in a couple months, and we had this urge to drop some doses (we could get it pretty much constantly so it wasn’t a problem for me, but my friend took a while. I had them a couple days after out conversation already and they were sitting in my car. I had realized that my parents were going to be gone right when I woke up for quite some time so I called my friend and told him to get his tabs tonight, he wasn’t able to find any and I decided I was going to fry by my lonesome. I have done this before, I have actually fried pretty hard by myself,  so I don’t know what happened (I think I let the music take more control of my thoughts) I do not know how different it would have been if I was with someone. I thought as long as I had music I would be alright.	So I wake up at around 9:00 o’clock, ate some food, then started sucking on three paper tabs, I never actually tasted anything on blotter tabs before, but I could actually taste a hint of some kind of chemical type thing and it tasted really weird on these tabs. I had made a couple calls telling friends to come over as soon as they were finished with work for the day. After that I lay on my back patio on my back on this chair still sucking on my papers facing the sun listening to music. Soon enough my whole entire wooden deck planks, scratches and patterns in the wood were swirling into each other and even my scars on my legs were getting pink then going to different colors,my hairs on my arm were shrinking and growing really sporadically to but I don’t like to think about that one.	I started to realize I was going to have a very fun trip and got a huge smile, it is about 10:30 and I am already so far gone , everything in my eyesight was doing something, it was mainly digital patters right under the skin of everything doing little swirly circle type things, and a couple shadow eyeballs in the trees. I have taken acid enough times to know sort of to make what I wan’t to see (not completely of course, for ex. I could not make a naked woman appear right in front of me) but I can kind of start to control my halucinations (control as -in no matter what you will hallucinate- but kind of altar it into what you think you might of been seen in the material or whatever).It was like 11:30 now and I was definitiley gone, I decided to go into my sisters room, lay on her white bed -the blanket wrinkles were all doing their own little moving and slow swaying, and the carpet had a constant blue flower pattern going across it- …fascinating. Then things started to get a little insane even though I kind of knew what was going on I continued to do it with full seriousness. I turned on the song “Welcome to the Machine” and that song made my sister’s whole white room come to life and I started getting a little nervous. As I was staring at my sisters fan, the fan became alive like a sunflower and started not talking to me but nodding and making expressions, I do not remember it talking, but I was talking. I then remember I started screaming and laughing, and the fan/flower, it was making weird emotions by curling up and springing back open, I then started crying really hard. When the song had gotten to the part where it has all the talking in the room, I thought my brain had hit into another dimension the whole earth was going to collide with something else. I was tripping harder then I Can explain.[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] It is like 1:00 o’clock and by this time I had moved into my room laying into a weird position and started crying, cartoons were on and I looked at the T.V.. and I thought the cartoons had started replaying back my life with the little cartoon characters, and it was all my friends and stuff. When I completely told my mind that that was really what was playing on T.V. I started crying because I had realized that it was showing my life in cartoons before I got taken away from earth and that I had died. When I would stand up everyway I leaned the walls would lean just as far back as I did except the other ways, I started laughing and crying again. I went into the bathroom and started peeing, I thought since I was dead maybe it was just something weird happening, but I would not stop peeing, I peed for like thirty minutes and I was crying and laughing hysterically while this was happening because I thought I was dead and I thought my whole body was going to completely drain out right there. I thought I was dead but could still roam this earth but could not interact with people. I had recently quit smoking (about 6 months ago) and I realized since I was dead I wanted a cigarette real badly. So I decided to get into my car and drive to the liqour store (stupid fucking idea) On my way up to the liquor store I saw a shadow eyeballs all over this one car, and from there on ouy for the rest of my night I saw shadow eyeballs (like dark outlines [but really detailed] eyeballs) in every single object I looked at.I stupidly got in my car and realized I could do what ever and I would not crash into anybody else, that I would completely go right threw them and drove insanely up to the liqueur store, I left my car not even in a parking space running and went in with no money, I asked for cigarettes and she said I had to pay, her face was dramatically changing, her moles were growing and shrinking, her facial hair doing the same thing and her eyebrows moving in rhythm. I went back to my car and grabbed my debit card, I started laughing hysterically while walking into the liquor store realizing I was dead and still using my debit card, I paid for the cigarettes and opened them up right there in the liquor store leaving the trash all over the counter (I was still standing at the counter right in front of the woman),  I then realized I did not have a lighter for my cigarettes and grabbed one from the counter (you know the shelves of lighters they have right next to the register) that was in a shelve thing and lit the cigarette in the store, the lady didn’t even bother to tell me to leave and she picked up the phone and  said she is calling the cops, I felt I looked even worse then a drunk man now that I think about it, because I was seriously acting like I was dead and I even asked her how do you see me. I left, and some how I was driving o.k. but sometimes my thoughts would come out loud and tell me weather to turn left or right, out loud as in like someone was sitting in the passenger seat saying right or left really loud, and then I could completely hear every single thing that I was thinking like someone was right next to me saying it out loud. When I came to a stop sign that was either left or right, for some reason I purposely made the sings turn into weird faces instead of right or left, I then picked the funniest looking face and went that way, and that’s what I based off which way I should go. I somehow made it home safely. (I also now recall chilling in the middle of an intersection for about 5 minutes deciding which way to go, I was taking my time because as I said earlier I was dead so I thought if  a car needed to go they would have just gone right threw me).	I got home and now it was like 3:00 o’clock, I remember sitting on my bed staring at my cell phone (the front part that showed the time [and tried to figure out the time for what about it seemed like 45 minutes]  to be able to read the time). I remember laying in my bed crying. My dad opens the garage and walks in to my room, I was able to look him in the eye  and act calm (while everything, including his face was doing something in its own weird way) only because I was so depressed I had died today, I even told him that I died before I walked out telling him I was going to get coffee, I haven’t talked to him yet so we will see what happens. I was also sick at this time so I do not know if that could have had any effect.By the end of the day sitting in bed, I would still consider the day an accomplishment because I went on a really intense journey, and I was definitely not still here on earth.

This was getting towards the end of a batch of synthetic mescaline hcl and some LSD tabs. It isn’t the most potent acid I’ve had by a long shot but it is really nice and clean...it ain’t all about the potency I have learned.Three of us would be tripping...me, my sister and one of my best and longest known friends. I have known this guy since the first year of secondary school and we began our pioneer psychedelic experimentation at the same time while at university in London together. This is someone I have a great deal of trust in, he’s a great guy and highly intelligent and empathic. I hadn’t seen him in a long time, and he was free of his rather controlling girlfriend which was a big plus, so he could just be himself. He is also good friends with my sister, and her first mushroom trip was with the two of us, a good few years ago now, and it had been a very special night for us all. My sister is less experienced than us but is by no means inexperienced. She shared an interest with us in psychedelics, and it was on an LSD trip with her then fiancé that made her realise she wasn’t happy. She thought the feelings were induced by the drug and would pass, but they didn’t, it seemed things came into the light she needed to be made aware of. Skip forward to now and we are living together and both working at or going to the same university and have our own flat we’ve made our own space, life is good.So, I had decided having experienced synthetic mescaline twice before at decent dosages, I would experiment by combining it with LSD, as this was the last of my stash and I had heard great things about this particular combination and here was an opportunity to try it. I’d really enjoyed the past mescaline experiences but found the visual domain much less inspiring than what I experience with cactus, so I hoped that the LSD would more fully open the doors of our visual perception. My sister and I were taking 650mg (approx) of the mescaline, and one and half tabs of acid. My friend is sensitive to the nausea of mescaline so he took around 500mg with two tabs of the acid. We are all in good spirits catching up and looking forward to the experience. The setting was our living room with appropriate lighting, tasty musical habitats to explore, sofas and pillows, a fair few plants, my sister’s beloved little dog, and last but not least a tropical aquarium with fish and other things in a great variety of forms and colours, and something really, really nice and relaxing to look at.The come up was gentle, the acid first. I felt some stomach awareness but this passed, and I didn’t purge this time with the mescaline, or feel much in the way of nausea. The last two times I did. My friend was sick and felt better immediately. The sun was starting to go down and it was a really nice evening. The mescaline started to build...and build. We all had the desire to stretch out. My sister and friend felt tension in their upper back and shoulders...not from the mescaline per se; just the mescaline was bringing to the surface imbalances in posture and a desire for massage. My sister experienced tangibly and more so than any experience previously the feeling she was being thoroughly examined and scanned in a healing sense. She had a little pain in her ovaries which passed...this is interesting in that the first time we took mescaline together, a lower dose of cactus extract...she had experienced pain in her ovaries, and a feeling like they were sapping her energy, so she went to the doctors and got diagnosed with dermoid cysts which had to be surgically removed. So mescaline I feel definitely has a particular attribute for self diagnosis, and not in a purely mental sense.The fusion of mescaline and lysergic acid was fantastic. There was energy and colour from the LSD, and this earthy grounded sensual body feeling from the mescaline. I felt enveloped in thick walls of soft bliss and comfort; it felt benign and like the air in the room was thick with it. I felt enveloped in thick walls of soft bliss and comfort; it felt benign and like the air in the room was thick with it. The LSD added some nice colour, depth and vividness to the visual domain. We were split between wanting to dance a bit and just stretch out and chill on the mescaline. Another difference from the cactus is I find the synthetic mescaline more sedating and harder to move around on. Or maybe I just felt less inclined. But I recall a few woodland adventures into the night on cactus before that had been great fun, but this just wasn’t the vibe with the pure stuff.The experience began to build more and change in character, becoming more internal, with effects continuing to build for a while. My sister has a little dog that we are both very fond of, and as the effects began to build he began to act stranger and stranger. I have heard of animals acting funny around trippers before many times, and I have experienced this myself a number of times. But this was something else. I fully appreciate we were both altered but we know this dog very well, and have done for the two years we’ve had him. He was acting very restless and we watched for a while as he seemed to be chasing something invisible around the room while attempting to chew it. It was like there was a magical moth in the room. He wasn’t running around lots though but had his neck craned upwards and it really seemed he was playing or trying to chew on something we simply couldn’t see. This behaviour went on for some time, and was of concern to my sister. I reassured her and said he certainly didn’t seem scared, more just curious and playful. It was very strange though and I would love to know what was going through his doggie brain then. It really seemed something was up, and I haven’t had that kind of experience before.Effects continued to build. The sun had gone down and it had clouded over. I felt a little tinge of darkness then. The trip was shifting gears into something else as the creeping mescaline started to peak. It was around then that my sister started to seriously freak out. She started to get very anxious and voiced all her insecurities, and kept worrying about her dog. This wasn’t good but I have encountered this kind of situation before and we were both talking her through this. She said the experience had become incredibly internal and introspective and that all her senses had crossed over into each other and it was incredibly confusing.I went into the kitchen having rolled a joint to get some frozen food for the fish in the tank. I walked into the kitchen and heard screaming and shouting and ran back into the living room to find my sister was scrabbling madly for the window and tearing off cloths. She was very distressed...to her, she would later explain, everything, including herself and us, the whole room, was on fire and melting. She could smell it, see it clearly but she really felt it too. She thought we were all burning alive together, and when she looked at us, it looked as if we were melting like molten lava, and this seemed incredibly real to her, so was a truly terrifying thing for her to experience. She got up a few times, and after her going for the window I had to physically restrain her a few times, something I’ve never had to do. She was convinced she was dying, along with us, and she kept having this experience repeatedly in cycles. I could kind of sense that she was both inside and yet outside of herself somehow. For a time I think she really felt out of body, but she described us as being with her there. At other times she wasn’t really aware of the room we were in anymore. Part of her was glad she was on the drugs as she thought these were killing some of the brain as she was dying. She voiced the same anxieties and concerns in cycles. Her concern for her dog was interesting in that she didn’t refer to him by name just a little dog that we need to care for. My friend and I just comforted her and hugged her and reassured her. It was horrible to see someone you care about so much experience such mental agony. And I was the one who had provided the doses, so it was partly my fault. While this was going on I was obviously a lot more focussed on her than myself, but I noticed that despite this, my trip had taken on a really dark nature...the visions I was seeing, especially of people’s faces changing, were really grotesque, and the earlier beautiful fusion of the acid and mescaline seemed to have fizzled out and it felt a bit now that my mind and body were caught between two different opposing powerful currents of the drugs. My pulse was elevated and it felt like my blood pressure was up, and I had weird and uncomfortable electric tingling in my body. My friend didn’t experience this discomfort, but the ratios of mescaline and LSD he ingested were different to myself and my sister (more tipped towards the LSD side of things).My sister was also really hot and sweating profusely, and I thought she may have had serotonin syndrome...this, along with the body tremors and confusion made this seem quite likely. She does take the SSRI citalopram, (which I personally don’t like) but she has taken this along with LSD, psilocybin, 25i numerous times and only had very positive experiences without any trace of physical or psychological discomfort, and had taken her last dose a few days before. So it seems the combination of mescaline and LSD could well pose a risk to people on SSRI’s. I also suspected serotonin syndrome from the cyclical nature of her anxieties. When everything was at its very worse for her we told her to let go and not fight it, and often with psychedelics this release can end one’s suffering. She said afterwards love for others in her life was the only thing she still held on to. She did let go but all her anxieties and insecurities would come and bombard her again repeatedly in a cyclical nature. It is possible that marijuana may have contributed to the confusion, although it wasn’t affecting me or my friend in that way; on the contrary it seemed to me to meld very nicely with the mix we had going on, and the combination was very pleasurable.After reassurance and hugging for a while, the anxiety attacks began to fizzle out in intensity and regularity. Later on it was much easier to talk her out of these loops of doom. Primal brain circuits had been activated though so even when she was ‘back’ from this, she had a strong aversion to candles burning or a joint being smoked, lest the whole room erupt into flames again.This was the only time my sister can ever say she experienced true terror. It is bizarre the extent to which one’s own mind can rebel against the self and devise extremely convincing and elaborate plots that work against one. Yet it is the experience of terror, to be gripped by the fear of losing everything in an instant that really makes you appreciate all you have in your life. So despite how horrific this experience was to my sister at the time, AND how horrific it was for me to witness this, she came back with some profound and lasting positive revelations on love, life and consciousness. I don’t really label trips as ‘bad’ or ‘good’, this seems far too shallow a way at labeling them...I guess this trip would be a monumentally bad trip for my sister, but in my experience, it is the more difficult experiences one learns more from and brings more back into their sober waking life. We all had the old reoccurring revelation of just how difficult these types of experiences are to put into words...words are great n’ all, just not up to describing the nature of such experiences that transcend their labels to such a degree.The latter part of the trip was nice. My sister was back and compos mentis; she was clearly exhausted and slept for a while on the sofa. My friend and I talked and listened to music, the electrical nature of consciousness seemed to keep coming up in conversation, and at some point we experienced a rather strange technological malfunction I cannot easily explain. We were listening to a playlist of new albums I had downloaded onto my iPod and prepared for the trip, and through my friend’s recommendation. We were listening to an album on this playlist, a Bluetech album, and the music very suddenly switched to something else. I am not sure what, but it was something with female vocals I didn’t recognise, but definitely not my kind of music. The fact that myself or my friend didn’t know what it was, was strange. I am very familiar with all the music on my iPod, I don’t have ‘filler’ music, and yet I am adamant the music that played is not on my iPod. It played for around 12 seconds before returning back to the Bluetech album, and my friend clearly experienced this too. Now, having downloaded many of these albums, it is possible that this snippet was downloaded with the music somehow, but I have listened to these albums individually multiple times and it has never come up, but for some reason it is now a part of the playlist. My sister identified the singer as Mariah Carey, and I don’t have any of her music in my iPod.  The iPod dock also has radio capabilities, but it was on iPod mode at the time so that shouldn’t have made any difference. It seems people tripping report electrical/technological glitches with a fair degree of frequency, and this was definitely a bit odd. Since the trip there have been a few other malfunctions, and on his return home my friend’s computer suffered multiple major malfunctions having been completely fine before, requiring several reboots and some degree of effort to make right again.We went on a walk at some point the next morning in the park in the sun which was nice, nature is always grounding. We got a few hours sleep and then stayed up for the rest of the day chatting and chilling, and all really enjoyed the rest of our weekend together. My friend decided it would not be wise for him to drive that day on so little sleep and stayed an extra night which was nice.My sister had a headache the next day and was tired. This went away though leaving a little residual tiredness for another day, but otherwise she felt good and grounded and the insights of the experience are still very much with her.The combination of two different chemicals may well be more than the sum of its parts in a biochemical sense. Also these compounds certainly aren’t toys, and this experience reminded us of their incredible power.Sister view! ~ after only about 20 minutes I felt the mental shift, it was gentle and soothing and the slight, teasing movements soon began: in art work, carpets and on the wall. Almost instantaneously alongside this, I had the urge to create myself a comfortable, cosy cushion bed on the living room floor besides the fish tank and facing the windows. As soon as it was ready I lay down and could feel some medicinal power working its way through the inner of my body. At first this power focussed directly on my ovary area, like the last time I took mescaline which soon lead me to discover that I had ovarian cysts that had a cancerous danger and which needed to be removed surgically, and, for he second time, I couldn’t help but massage them and feel the inside of me being paid attention and worked on. It did hurt but not in your normal, sober pain-sense way, but the hurt version you can experience under these circumstances instead. This lasted a while and then I found myself massaging my neck and the top of my back, my hands knew exactly what to do and I was finding the exact knots that have been causing me pain in the working week recently. It felt good! However, this medical attentiveness didn't stop or lessen, it was constant and was becoming stronger as were the visions in both intensity and speed, the clouds for example were now rolling and skimming noticeably fast across the sky in an exaggerated cartoon, thunder storm type way. The medical checking was now working on my physical body, my muscles as well as my skin. I wanted to control it after a while and the boys wanted to attempt playing UNO, as we had previously said we would! So I sat up and my posture was demanding to be corrected and straight, and I couldn't stop twisting my neck to stretch the muscles, and it was a good feeling but demanding in an out-of-my-control way. We started playing UNO and I think this is when my first paranoid thinking started. Because I couldn't get a grasp on the simple rules and kept on saying, 'wait, can I...?' Being typical of me, this would normally just be funny and not matter, but my altered state was telling me otherwise and I began becoming sure that our friend (A) was looking at my brother (B) in a 'really!?' type way and that B was thinking it would be best to just ignore me. I knew these things weren't true and I tried to push them aside but my whole posture had turned so that my head was pointing away from A and more at my brother, and to look at A, someone I love very much, would bring the insecure thoughts flooding back, and I couldn't understand how a game of UNO could take such a sinister turn. I had to concentrate and sort of stalk their actions to make sure, but it didn't take too long to realise that B and A were both definitely also in completely trippy worlds, undergoing enveloping journeys of their own, and that at this point I wasn’t over tripping nor the centre of a private side topic of the little, stupid girl in the room. We then attempted to return to giving the UNO game a real try, I wanted to so I joined the group mentality and, for a short time, understood where we each and all were, and that this paranoia was silly and would pass, and managed a bit of cards-playing with some laughter and rule remembering. However there was still doubt and darkness in my mind, I was trying to displace it. We all agreed we had given it a good attempt and that we would move the night onwards to wherever it was going to take us. With the gradual arrival of the darkness of night, I also felt a darkening shift in my mental state, the only way to describe this right now is exactly that, dark and heavy, but not scary or overwhelming, yet, I then found myself in a yoga-type position, bending over on the floor with my head between my knees. For me this would usually be too much of an attention-seeking kind of position, a weird one, but I couldn’t help but stay in it, while I felt the trip getting stronger and stronger, with a strong sense that it was going to go somewhere I didn’t want it to go. I soon forced myself to lie down on my side, facing the underneath of the table, where my dog now was, and behind him I could see my brother if I twisted under a little bit. This is when my dog started chewing and following something otherwise invisible in the air under the table, between B and me. I wanted to close my eyes but thought I should be experiencing the sights and that A and B would think that’s a wrong thing to do. During my last look into the clouds outside of the window, the specific area of cloud I looked out, twisted and formed into an evil-joker face; I acclaimed out loud to my brother that I could “see Mr. Mescaline in the clouds.” The battle of wanting to refrain from closing my eyes was lost, and from here on my eyes were either closed or open, but I am not sure because everything I saw, I now know but certainly didn’t then, was definitely not there.The next few hours are hard to order and explain clearly, because clear they weren't! I can only tell you what was going on inside my head, as that was all the reality I had, all everything, there was no material or normal sense or MEMORY - of anything, apart from right now, in my head - everything was, temporarily, lost. The 'reality' was going on in my head and we were talking and going on as normal, until I actually spoke out loud part of the conversation that 'normal life me' was having with the boys, and then this would abruptly break the 'normality' and I realised that all that I was imagining was just being imagined, and when I spoke out loud I realised what was going on was a very sinister game and realised that the conversations weren't going on at all, but they were all in my head. The 'reality' was going on in my head and we were talking and going on as normal, until I actually spoke out loud part of the conversation that 'normal life me' was having with the boys, and then this would abruptly break the 'normality' and I realised that all that I was imagining was just being imagined, and when I spoke out loud I realised what was going on was a very sinister game and realised that the conversations weren't going on at all, but they were all in my head. The game was this: if I didn't speak the two guys would go about their ways as normal. At this point B was rolling a joint and A was dancing but, as soon as I spoke out loud, because I forgot for that split second that if I spoke I would completely disrupt the peace. There seemed to be two worlds: one in the room that we were supposed to be in, having a nice, chilled night like we were supposed to be having. But the other side was the trip side, but the one I was sure was reality - only none of us could see the incredibly dark truth - the world that was preparing to take our lives away that evening.I kept making the mistake of speaking out loud and getting ‘it’ wrong, and the intensity of this confusion worsened every time I slipped up and made a noise. I soon realised that I couldn't speak properly, as I knew that by getting what was going on wrong, I was making the situation worse and deepen towards a point of no return. So I figured I would have to just say one word at a time either to ask a question or vocalise an insecurity or worry. By this time I was so confused that words lost their meaning, and then I couldn't really remember what words were. Before I knew it the game had taken a disastrous turn and because I kept getting the game wrong, the consequences were becoming more and more serious. A part of my normal consciousness was attempting to break through and try to make sense of the whole situation. But trying to find reality backfired and instead caused a stronger sense of confusion A part of my normal consciousness was attempting to break through and try to make sense of the whole situation. But trying to find reality backfired and instead caused a stronger sense of confusion, a state of confusion so strong, that the consequences of that confusion were more and more quickly becoming a matter of life and death. The more I tried to figure out, the more I realised I couldn't remember. I was suddenly faced with the fact that I could not remember the flat we lived in, who I was, what was this thing we were doing. In this spiral of blocked mentality I burst out and demanded 'Somebody please tell me something! Anything!' the word I was looking for was quite literally 'life,' because I couldn't remember it myself, I had no idea what was the purpose of anything, what were the words for anything, even how to speak or ‘what’ I was. I lay back down and I think after some time I opened my eyes and was having some horrible, rapid visions of my little dog weeing on me as well as humping his teddy all around me with disgusting, bright red visions of his penis out, and baring his teeth in lots of different areas all around me. The next thing I saw was him cocking his leg to wee on my face.  I felt my face and, though my senses had seemed to all conjoin into one and I had no hope of differentiating between them, I was certain I was soaking wet, face, hair and all, and I was also sure that part of this wetness was his semen too. I bolted upright and to my horror while feeling for more semen on my clothes I suddenly realised I was melting in a slow, electric, amorphous type way. I looked at the table which was now my shoulder height, where we had some tea lights lit, and the only explanation I could find right then was that one or all of them had somehow spilled over and set the table on fire. I glanced towards the living room door and saw that only the dark corridor on the other side of it looked cool and airy, but from inside the living room door and all around the whole room was a thick smoke, and I quickly put two and two together and was sure that in the real world, which we were all blind to because of the trip, the living room had caught fire and in my trip I had been so out of it while lying down, that I hadn’t noticed the fire, none of us had, and we had made one HUGE mistake and this was the end - I was burning to death and there would be nothing or anything any of us could do. We couldn't call the police and we couldn't phone a friend and in our states we were incapable of putting the fire out, we were already on fire, us, the dog, the table, the room. The sensation of burning alive was soaring through the whole of my body, and the room around me was contorting and melting as one. I remember thinking that maybe someone would see me if I went into the dark outside, or even the cool air might stop the fire. A flash of my lost consciousness attempted to return here and I remember tackling with this message by wandering 'would I die if I jumped off the balcony? wait, I'm tripping, this could be a really bad  idea, try and think, have people died from trips - particularly balcony jumping trips - before?' The answer was not there. I am guessing it was at some point during these thoughts I jumped up and was scrabbling for the windows and tearing my clothes off. This is HIGHLY unlike me, I am wretchedly insecure of my body, something that also came out in this trip, but funnily enough I do have a snapshot of looking down on my body and seeing my knickers and trousers down by my feet. But I remember viewing this at the time, and the result was neither self-consciousness or even self-applied, I looked at these bare legs as if they were not mine, and if they were mine then it probably wasn't happening, and there was nothing I could do about it anyway. At the time, I certainly didn’t recall doing it to myself; however I do almost remember jumping up and true and terrifying panic taking over and engulfing me. When I got up the extent of the situation hit home and the flames and burning and melting were out of control – it was happening, it was too late. The next time I feel like I opened my eyes, I was now, new-to-me, on the sofa. My brother was holding me and looking into my face from my right, and A was staring into my face with fear-wide eyes on my left. The look on their faces hit home and I knew something was up and had seriously changed the vibe in a bad way. A was saying 'you've got nothing to worry about, what are you worried about?' The way he phrased it made it seem as though this wasn't the first time he'd asked me it, and in a sudden epiphany I realised the answer to save us all, to save us from the trip which I now understood was the world that was on fire, but had the very definite reality of burning us all alive if we let it go too far. In an instant I understood the answer and cure, and had to vocalise it all at once. In this episode of declaration I verbalised that I was worried that we were all dying, it felt and looked like the room was on fire, that we should put all the candles out, that the name of the game was confusion and I was getting lost in it, that there was a dog that we should be worrying about, and, last and definitely least, that I ‘looked bad’! I don’t remember what they said exactly, but I knew they were trying to soothe me but I had already started lapsing back into it, and was once again sure that they couldn’t see it, that we were all dying, all on fire burning alive, the room, the fish tank, us, the dog, and I leaned back and in front of my vision was being enveloped in flames and twisting round from my peripheral view and edging it’s way in a melting, circular fashion towards the very center of my vision. The panic was strong and I knew I had the power to stop it all but I just couldn’t figure out how. In desperation I was thinking through my options and trying to figure out this horrific game’s main rule, and realised I had to snap out of it by getting it right and focusing on and verbalising the facts. At absolute peak point the world and boys on either side of me had twisted and contorted around the center of my vision. I could feel as well as see the pain of burning fire inside me, melting me alive. As I looked at my beloved boys I knew that they too were despairing of the fact that it was all up to me, we were all burning alive beyond repair, and that it would, within seconds, be too late. We would die from this Earth and in the morning all that would be left is burning ash. At that point I shouted and sat up “wait wait wait wait wait!!! Ok ok, we’re dying, we’re dying, we have to do something, I’m so so sorry, we’re dying, we’re all burning alive, I’m burning alive!” I turned to my brother and genuinely asked him, we’re dying aren’t we, I’m dying? The response I saw was a nod and tear in his eye, the fire and melting had temporarily subsided; yet I was still sure I was dying somehow. I looked around the room and could see the smoke among all the surfaces was slowing alighting once again. I returned to look at my brother and remember thinking, ‘it’s such a shame, this beautiful man, who I love so much, this one trip, this one mistake or slip-up, is going to be the end of him, of all of us, and what a shame, what a waste, that would be’. I started to cry as this reality retook control and I declared out loud the things I was letting go of. I said “so there’s no morning, there’s no waking up, there’s no going to school (where I work), there’s no K (rediscovering my dogs name), there’s no sun, there’s no mum, there’s no granddad, no D (my soul-mate, life-lover, who couldn’t be with us on this evening) there’s no us, there’s no you”. I cried more and closed my eyes while being hugged by B, I also had my arm around A and I told them that I loved them, and said “as long as K knows, as long as he knows I loved him as best I could, as long as all of you know…” The burning had returned and I remember some serious leg tremors going on as I lay on my side leaning on my brother.My legs began to shake more and more, violently so, and I don’t know if K really was there but at this point I looked down and he was snuggled into my tummy as we were lying on the floor. I stroked him and repeated to myself, that I loved him and I loved the boys, I looked at him and remember thinking how sorry I was that he would have to burn alive with me, I could see flames rising around him and his body melting slowly beneath his singeing fur, I told the boys that I was so sorry, so so sorry, they said it’s ok and this only further affirmed that they too were letting go, and we were all in the realisation that this was the end, one trip had been the cause of it all, and there was nothing any of us could do. And in my head, with my eyes closed, I now saw darkness. However I was never fully gone. Because in the darkness I did have something to grasp onto, I had love. I felt it so strongly and my metaphorical hands were reaching out in front of me and clutching onto it because it was, and is, everything. I could see the faces and was saying the names inside my head of some people I truly love, I thought of my boyfriend, my brother, my mum and my granddad. And I remember thinking, this is the end, but as long as they know, truly know, that I loved them and will love them forever, then that is the most important thing and all that ever mattered. From previously worrying about work and day time, none of the other things mattered anymore, and love was the only reason, the only cause and the only matter of importance; and I hadn’t lost it, I had found it in a more profound, intense, beautiful way than ever before. It was all that mattered and everything, and I knew that all this love I felt, for the people in my life that I was thinking of, was wholesomely and unconditionally true and pure. I could no longer see their faces but I saw their soul, they each shined a bright, active, silver glowing trail of iridescent silver/white body-streams. It didn’t matter what they looked like, what anyone looked like, because when we truly love, we love the soul and this is the only constant and matterful thing which exists throughout the whole expansion of our lives, and as an old man, I could see my boyfriend, and his glowing, energetic soul and knew that our souls would still be connected, and in love, because they had electrically conjoined with each other in a magnetic, irreversible type way. I don’t know how long after but I suddenly became aware that I was clutching onto my brother, almost lying across his chest, both on the floor. A was at my feet, and my first thoughts while coming back into the world, was that love is all the same. True love, for anyone, family or otherwise, is holding each other, embracing, non-embarrassing, rich, and intense love. And if you loved anyone properly, then that would be the truth of it. This calmed down and after a long time of gathering together the reality that I hadn’t died, that we had survived, and that K was still here, tired but fine. I searched my surroundings and reabsorbed the room bit by bit. I looked at A and it seemed as though he was lighting a joint, I realised he wasn’t when he answered my fear of “careful of the fire, we should turn everything off, all candles and everything” by pointing out that everything in the room had already been blown out, and used my funny language to respond to me specifically, that everything (even though I was talking about fire be it a lighter or candle) had indeed been “switched off.” My brother later moved me up onto the sofa. I remember feeling completely drained and exhausted, mentally and physically, and I clambered onto the near bit of sofa and curled up. K immediately joined me and began curling up with me to sleep too. This hugely comforted me but I was also flooded with a familiar feeling of remorse for anything I had put him through. I fell asleep and when I woke up, I was exhausted yet uplifted. I welcomed back the light of day, and another chance at this life we all share.Exp Year: 2013ExpID: 100568Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 28 Published: Oct 13, 2019Views: 4,354    LSD (2), Mescaline (36) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Health Problems (27), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Guides / Sitters (39), Second Hand Report (42), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:003 hitsoralLSD(gel tab)  T+ 0:00  smokedCannabis(plant material)  T+ 4:001 hitsmokedCocaine BODY WEIGHT:120 lbI will start off with a little info about myself and my past experience with recreational drugs. I am 18 years old, about 6'2', 120lbs and am relatively healthy.I first began using marijuana regularly about 8 months ago and have progressed through the use of alcohol, dxm, ecstasy, nitrous, salvia, painkillers, sleep aids, cocaine, and now finally LSD. LSD had been on my 'to-do' list before I ever even tried marijuana or any other illegal substance. When I finally found out I could get some, I didn't care what the price. I left for my regular dealer's (I'll call him T) house around 5 PM on a Friday night with two friends.I purchased 3 hits, and my two friends purchased 2 and 1 respectively. We each started dissolving them right away and T told us we could stay there until we came down because he had some cool stuff to show us while we tripped. About a half hour after the gels dissolved I noticed that I was feeling very high (elevated mood and a huge grin). T told me to start looking at different patterns to see if anything was moving yet. Nothing noticeable at the time, so T packed a bowl and told us that this would help it kick in. We passed a bong twice around the circle and soon I was feeling very messed up. I couldn't concentrate on anything and everything around me was just swirling and making me laugh. I would decide to do something (change a CD, make a phone call) and forget about it within seconds. I noticed that my friends were having equally intense trips and wondered if I really needed 3 hits, but it didn't bother me too much.After a long time of just rolling around on the couches and listening to very intensely trippy music, I noticed that I had to pee. I made my way to the bathroom and all the towels hanging on racks looked like they were waving at me. I steadied myself to piss and the toilet looked like it was spinning. I finally got the job done and headed for the door, only to be startled by my appearance in the mirror. I barely recognized myself. My face looked as though it was oozing downward and I had gained at least 50 pounds. I quickly left the bathroom and headed back toward the living room where my friends were.(T + 4:00) T called my name from his room and I went in. He showed me the visuals that were running on his media player and they slowly branched out to where I could see them on the walls in his room. He prepped a sheet of foil with cocaine and told me to take a hit. He held the foil and lighter and I held the mouthpiece and took a ridiculously deep hit (by my standards) and felt an instant renewal of my original high. Since my friends and I had been basically taking up space in his living room for a good four hours now, I suggested to them that we take a walk back to J's (the guy who took 2 hits) place. I don't remember much after this in the way that I remember other things.Everything I know about what happened afterward, I know as fact instead of a memory. I am told that I sprinted all the way to J's house, J and his girlfriend chasing me all the way to the front door. We went upstairs and I plopped down on J's mattress. The next thing I know, I could not stop checking the clock. I would pick up his alarm clock, exclaim 'It's not even ____!' and run to the door of his room, which was locked and at the time, quite difficult to figure out. I would lie back down and repeat the process for about a half hour until J and his girlfriend were coming down a little bit and thought they ought to try and restrain me so I wouldn't wake anyone up or injure myself. I felt like I was dying. My body felt like it was crushed and soaked with blood, as though I had been in a bad accident, and I could even taste blood in my mouth. I believed I was at a hospital, receiving treatment for this accident I was in. I was so scared by the thought of my death that even called 911 and my home and everyone on my contacts list trying to get help. J took the phone from me so I wouldn't say anything I'd regret and I felt so helpless. It wasn't long before I thought my heart was stopping and I could hear my parents crying at the hospital because I was going to die.All of a sudden, I did die (in the trip of course) and I thought I was in 'limbo' with J. I was trying to have him communicate to my parents that I was very sorry and all sorts of things I would want them to know that I didn't have the chance to tell them. For the rest of the night, I believed 'god' was taking on the image of J so I would be comfortable in heaven, or wherever I was. I sat in J's room feeling depressed that there was so much I hadn't done and then I realized I could do anything I wanted to. I started to get naked and run for the front door, ready to explore heaven. He caught up with me and suggested that we go to his dad's house for the night. It was then that I wondered why god would have a dad, and I thought the maybe J was satan. I refused to go with him, basically trying to show satan how tough I was and began throwing things at him. Apparently, I was still tripping (to be able to think things like this) but it wasn't obvious to me. I was scheduled to work the next day at 12:00 and I skipped it because I still thought I was dead. It wasn't until a little after 2:00 when I got a phone call that I realized I wasn't dead and I hurried home to get ready for work.I would still do LSD again, but probably a smaller dosage and I would need a tripsitter who wasn't tripping himself to help me through something like my own death. I will not again do the combo of LSD and Cocaine, although I cannot say for sure that that is what set me off. I hope this report has been helpful, or at least entertaining for anyone who has read it.Exp Year: 2006ExpID: 56920Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 18 Published: Oct 13, 2019Views: 3,312    LSD (2), Cocaine (13) : First Times (2), Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:2 tabletsoralLSD(blotter / tab)   repeatedoralAlcohol - Beer/Wine(liquid)   repeatedoralAlcohol - Hard(liquid)BODY WEIGHT:187 lbI have been an experienced drug user for about 6 years now, doing almost every drug imaginable in my past, but finally cutting it down primarily to pot and alcohol. Getting most of my drug use out of my system before even getting to college, I was more than satisfied with sticking to herb and brew. I did enjoy eating mushrooms or acid every time I got the chance due to them being relatively rare drugs around my area and have tripped shrooms about 35 times and had about 8-9 previous lsd experiences eating as much as 3 hits at a time.Me and my friends picked up a ten strip from a total sketch job, and with the thick tabs and nice logos we figured it would be good stuff, not realizing how right we were about that. On Friday night I had drank pretty heavily despite knowing I was going to trip the next day, and got only 7 hours of sleep. Waking up tasting booze in my mouth, I knew I did not have time to nurse a hangover and had to eat the “LaLa” as soon as possible because I tend to have 20 hour acid experiences.Me and my buddy both ate two hits and took the train downtown. After about 25 min. I began to feel funny and being sensitive to chemicals sensed the acid taking my to LaLa land quite quickly. We arrived to downtown Chicago, and the day was beautiful, not a single cloud in the sky and the warm sun beating down on us. We were trippin pretty good for about 3 hours, walking around and ddecided to go see a movie, Kung Fu Panda. It was one of the best times ever. Anyways when we got out of the theater the acid seemed to have calmed down and I felt like the trip was coming to an end even though it had been only 5-6 hours into it.We decided to go over to my friend’s apartment because it was his b-day and he was going to have a party. We made our way up there and when he opened the door and we walked in, all of a sudden everything changed…towards the worse. He was watching the new hairspray in a very dark room and I walked up to the tv and when I saw John Travolta in the fat suit, which was hilarious, for some reason I got really REALLY really frightened. Travolta’s eyes seemed really dilated and the grew huge like alien eyes. I got cold/hot flashes and the room began to cave in on me. I had my ipod and decided to go in my buddy’s room and listen to some weezer because they always put me in a good mood. But as I lay on his bed and began to listen to the music, everything became tooo intense. I closed my eyes and I began to see all my friends and family, EVERYONE I knew laughing happily but aging at the same time and rotting out, I saw myself graduating college, getting married growing old dying..I saw the universe and my own insignificance within it. This all sounds very cool, but it was one of the most intense incites I had ever had. I couldn’t keep my eyes closed it was too scary, but when I opened them, everything was still really messed up too. The lamp shades were dancing around the lamp, a movie poster was crawling around the wall and the ceiling was wavy as if it was liquid.I realized I was having my first bad acid trip and felt like I was about to have a psychotic breakdown. I ran out of the room and decided to talk to my friend. He has long curly hair and as he was trying to talk me down, all I saw was little versions of his face in his own hair laughing at me. My best friend now seemed like a freakish demon in my eyes. I decided to go outside and get some fresh air. I stepped outside and the sun was now setting. I had taken the cid hours ago and it took me soo long to peak that I realized I might be tripping for much longer than I had expected. I saw downtown Chicago with all the lights on and a purple sky with the sun setting and it seemed so beautiful that it hurt my eyes to look at it. In fact my eyes were so dilated that I could not really see anything more than 20 feet in front of me too clearly and people in the distance seemed hazy and unfocused. I decided to go back inside and have a beer, hoping the alcohol would take the edge off..and it did. In fact I got a pint of rum and decided to just get drunk to calm the whole trip down.Good idea! People showed up for the party and we all ended up having a great time. But I still have goosebumps about the hour or so of hell. Because when the acid is in my head, I cannot escape it..Anywhere I go I'm still tripping, and despite my love for psychedlics I think I got my fix of the ultimate acid trip where I felt anymore would just kill me. I’ve eaten 5 hits before and not tripped as hard as I did off these thick, tasteless, star branded blotters. I don’t think I will trip again for at least a year, even though everything worked out ok. Setting is everything, I thought my trip was over then I switched locations and I got a mindfuck.Exp Year: 2008ExpID: 71896Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Oct 13, 2019Views: 597    LSD (2) : General (1), Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Music Discussion (22), Various (28) DOSE: T+ 0:001 tabletoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 4:00  smokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:65 kgSo I decided to finaly try LSD with a good mate of mine. Being excited for about 2 weeks I thought there would be no problems what so ever because I had done lots of research and knew what could happen to me.Nothing could have prepared me for my experience.We both took 1 hit at about 3pm in the afternoon and then settled down for a quite afternoon/evening.We were pretty much waiting for it to hit us while watching tv, an hour passed and nothing.....and hour and a half passed, a slight head-ache but nothing....2 hours passed which made it about 5oclock with no effects what so ever. We then began to think that nothing would happen so I remembered about some weed we had stored away for a rainy afternoon, we got it and started to roll out some joints.At about 7pm, 4 hours after taking the LSD we smoked the weed and it might have not been the best option considering this was the first time I had taken LSD.Within 10 minutes we both just clicked into peak mode. It was like I was normal and then 1 second later I was tripping hard.I started to feel very scared and paraniod about what was going on, I didnt know what was happening to my mind. My friend still knew that we were only tripping but I didnt.By this stage I couldnt remember taking LSD and my mind was starting to play all sorts of tricks on me, I couldnt get a grip on what was real and what was fake. I started to doubt everything..even my best mate. I couldnt accept that it was all real, my mind was spinning and everything was moving in a fowards directions and everything looked digital, it all looked very smooth and fake. My perception of my best friend was a little man standing up inside my mind, he wasnt real and he was trying to trick me into things by telling me that we were only tripping on LSD, I couldnt believe him. I thought he was in my imagination and he wasnt real by of course he was. I was trying to fight against my mind so hard it was making me crazy. Everything felt as if it was a big mind game in my head, it felt as if I was not inside my body but I was a spirit flying around fighting inside my head and everything around me wasnt real, it wasnt there.I had no sense of feel left in my hands of legs, I trying holding a glass but it felt as if there was no weight in it, it was floating in mid air. This was all VERY scary and I was becoming a wreck...The first hour was the scariest hour of my lifetime...I though I was going to stay crazy for ever and it really was scary. After about an hour and peaking and being scared out of my mind, seeing everything from a different view I started to understand what was going on. It sort of clicked in my head after being told about 100 times that we wer eon LSD. I finaly got a grip on reality. I knew we were only tripping.Things started to change...I went on the couch and lied down to relax and listen to some music...amazing. The music felt as if it were playing inside me, it was so relaxing and enjoying.I remember looking at the walls and seeing them moving into weird shapes and colours, everything would not stop moving. It was fantastic after I had finaly got a grid on reality!!I'm still not really sure when or if I will do LSD again, I would like to experience it again because it really did open up my mind to a different and scary world...To sum it up, I had never been so scared of anything before in my life and it was truly terrifying not being able to control my thoughts and not being able to stop myself fighting my mind, but I am glad I went through some of it. I didnt really understand how powerfull a mind really is and I really do have alot more respect for LSD now, I'm not sure why it didnt take any effects after some hours and I'm sure the weed did something to set the LSD off because it was instant....I learnt that this drug needs respect, and if its to be taken it MUST be with nothing but respect for it....Exp Year: 2003ExpID: 23290Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 5, 2019Views: 732    LSD (2) : General (1), First Times (2), Combinations (3), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Music Discussion (22), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:3 tabletsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:12 stI have to firstly say that I completely advocate the use of drugs as Ive had fantastic experiences on so many occasions.  However, there was one time in my drug history where I took too much LSD and had an experience I could only equate as utter Hell.I was 19 at the time and completely up for doing any drug.  I bought 10 trips from my neighbour at college and went home to do acid with my friend.The night began with him and I going to this girl's birthday party, but before going in I said to my friend that we should take 3 trips each (I had a brilliant experience in the past with acid and assumed that taking 3 times the strength could only make it 3 times better).  The night began really well as my friend and I gradually became higher and higher on acid at this girl's party.  Of course the party was at her parents house, hosted by her parents so we weren't exactly doing the most civilised of activities.  I told my friend that we had to leave and he agreed so we left to walk home.  I lived in quite a rural area and so the walk home was essentially through part of a town and the country...The walk home was phenomenal.  Whenever I used to do acid, the whole time-era I was in went back to the 1950s as everything became black-and-white, and the streetlights gave a neon tint making the whole world be in pure technicolor.  So many mad incomprehensible occurance took place like a huge friendly Great Dane in the middle of nowhere with no owner with it.  Imagine that, walking down a country road and fields far miles from any houses and a huge Great Dane comes up to greet you.  This was obviously a stray dog but the coincidence of us tripping as well was mad!!  And we were still getting higher and higher on acid...Anyway, once we got back I said to my friend that I wanted to go in and listen to the Orb music to really add to the experience.  We separated from each other and I got in my house.  This must have been the early hours of the morning and I knew that its always a good thing to drink a glass of orange juice before going to bed when I've been tripping.I opened the fridge door and got a glass from the cupboard.  I then started to pour the orange juice and the whole world then became orange, pure ORANGE.  This was the hallucination becoming solid, no trails of lights on the edges of objects, but a complete change of my visual field to the colour ORANGE.  The whole world became one single shade of orange, no differences in shades, just all the same shade of orange.Of course I started to panic and the experience got worse and worse.  I then had the images that I was seeing, merging into each other all around me.  Every image around me - what was a toaster, what was a kettle, what was an orange juice carton, a chair, they all started merging into each other and I was seeing images as though they were monsters approaching me from the left again and again and again.I lost the complete 'core self' that we all have.  I term this 'core consciousness' - the part of you which is the experience of being 'you'.  Your 'I' if you like.  That went from me and all I was thinking about was 'This is insanity there is no 'I' I am just an amalgamation of sensory inputs, I do not exist.  I also thought that even though I was 19 I was wearing my mind out completely i.e. I thought I had the mind of a 100 year old person and so I was running out of my finite numebr of thoughts.I must have at some point taken all my clothes off, because I then remember walking round my small village completely naked with not an item of clothing on me.The whole trip lasted for at least 14 hours as I eventually came down enough to find where I was and get back into my bedroom.  I have to tell you though, I cant image an experience ever being worse than that.Exp Year: 1995ExpID: 45127Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Nov 5, 2019Views: 1,171    LSD (2), OBE (332) : General (1), Bad Trips (6), Various (28) DOSE:  oralLSD    CannabisBODY WEIGHT:250 lbI can't put time stamps but I'll try to explain what happened.First once the tabs dissolved and started working my vision was really bright and colorful. I decided to take a shower, a really hot shower. Only when getting out I realized I felt nothing, complete dissociation. I felt nothing, complete dissociation. I dried my hair and couldn't feel the heat at all, or me getting the knots out of my hair. A while later I feel nothing at all, completely naked. My field of view seemed to get super large, with whatever I was looking at hyper zoomed in. I started to panic, trying to distract myself from it, I noticed that my peripheral vision was becoming a hole, my desk was getting infinitely long, my walls forming some sort of maze-like pattern. I felt shocks of pain in my body, sort of like electricity slowly pulsing through my body, I checked my heart rate and it was 125 BPM.After this I started to panic a bit more. The corners of my vision were stretching and stretching I was seeing my vision as if it was one of those infinite mirrors, I was seeing fractals inside of every letter I looked at, I was also sweating a bunch. I didn't feel hot or cold though, I felt nothing. I panicked on discord for a bit, asking for help but not reading the replies at all. I laid down and tried to calm myself but I started to feel a pain right inside of my heart. This is when I became visually disconnected from the world.As I laid in my bed looking up, I was in a corner looking up at a massive monitor.  I was panicking and got up, going back to my desk, the monitor did not go away, I was watching my vision from another room it felt like. It got even worse.Somehow I got into a thought loop, I would think about literally anything, and my mind would think of the opposite at the same time, which somehow made me visually see my ideas, zooming in and zooming out, it was like I was zooming out of atoms and back in at the same time. I lost most connection to reality visually, I could not see my room unless I got up and distracted me, I was having a thought loop both visually and mentally, Infinitely zooming in and out of my thoughts. I was on my bed staring at my clock, time was gone for me, It felt like years were passing when only seconds had. At the time I forgot how many things I do every second, I assumed that it usually took me 3-4 minutes to leave my room to walk to the kitchen. I dropped my clock and felt the pain in my heart grow, I thought I was having a heart attack. I was seeing objects that looked super familiar but that I never saw before. My watch died at this point so I couldn't check my heart rate. I assumed it was in the 200's but that makes no sense. This happened for a while until I started to accept my death, I picked out a song to die to and planned to "die" at a certain part. I didn't think it would get worse, but it did.My vision started to zoom out of the monitor, until I was seeing my body in these cluster of atoms, which zoomed out to show normal daily scenes, mostly of minor inconveniences, burning my hand on a hot cup, dropping a paper, spilling water. My vision would zoom out into these scenes. I had no control over my thoughts, I kept panicking and forgot all about accepting my death. I got up and poured cold and hot water on my face, feeling absolutely nothing, I then drank some tap water (which makes me disgusted because of the after taste). The taste suprised me enough to get my vision back, but a second later it started to zoom out again, trapping me into whatever well I was in now. I went outside (dressed), hoping the cold air would help, and it did for a second, then my vision returning to whatever I was seeing in my head. I went back on my bed and got under my blankets, on the edge of calling 911. This happened for a while, until around the end of my peak everything got again, worse.As my vision was zooming out faster and faster, It sort of stopped. My vision was inside of a white office cubicle. I was some sort of shadow entity, who pulled a folder out of the drawer at his desk. He pulled out a white binder folder and opened it, my vision zooming into it. I saw multiple of my vision in this folder, one sort of pulled out and zoomed into.  I wasn't zooming out any more, until my vision went back to the monitor, I was looking up at this infinitely tall shadow person, who was watching me from that desk. It was terrifying at the time, it had no features, no emotions, I still know not one thing about it except that it looked human.  The eyes were microscopic dots that I was able to see no matter how far away somehow.  It was too late to accept my "death" now, I felt like I had set off some alarm and was in trouble for it. I felt like I had set off some alarm and was in trouble for it. I don't remember much else happening except my vision sort of snapping back to normal. I fell out of my bed panicked, still very dissociated physically in an instant my thought loop was over, mentally and visually. I got nothing except fear out of this trip. I entirely underestimated the combo of LSD and THC, especially since I have no idea how much THC I took. I had no trip sitter, and was alone in my bedroom for most of the trip, except when going outside or to the bathroom.Exp Year: 2019ExpID: 113797Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 19 Published: Nov 20, 2019Views: 675    LSD (2), Cannabis (1) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Entities / Beings (37), Difficult Experiences (5), Alone (16) DOSE:7 dropsoralLSD(liquid) 1 lineinsufflatedKetamine(powder / crystals)BODY WEIGHT:70 kgAcid TestHaving had a lot of experience with LSD, including large doses. I decided to test a drop of liquid that a friend had recently required. I've taken seven drops of liquid before and having had experience of different bottles I thought I would be ok for the ride. I took the drop and sat back to relax at my friends house, there was some Ketamine going and I took a line as I was a bout to come up. About 10 mins in I went to the toilet and the white walls already had full-on fractal patterns moving across them. I just realized that I had consumed an extremely large dose of a bottle that definitely need watering down!I proceeded to leave my friends house and stagger across town to a pub where we were meeting friends. I used to stay in my house when tripping, unless I was somewhere safe like the countryside. I think this was a mistake walking around a city ski hi. Anyway getting to the noisy pub was rather unpleasant, my mind was making it's own speech out of all the different conversations and It started making it's own voices. People kept talking to me and I couldn't make out what they where saying.I was still riding it at this stage, when it was suddenly closing time, I knew this was a bad sign as it seemed I had only just got there, I should have been leveling out yet I was still coming up. I left the pub and my friend got all heavy on me, he warned me that I was heading for a bad trip and that he had been where I had (not a very nice thing to say although to be fair I was so out of it I might have imagined him saying it. I went onto the party and things got from bad to worse, I started walking home convinced that I was going to die. A close friend walked me back and I honestly thought he was Satan. This is odd as I am not christian, anyway I seriously thought I was Christ walking through the desert with my friend was satan trying to trick me. I got home and walked into my house, it was dark and I new that when I goto my room I was going to die. I ran out onto the street screaming and my friend came back. I thought everything he asked me was a test to see if I would goto heaven or hell. It was like I was trapped inside a maze within my mind with every thought relating to my bad trip and eternal damnation.By this stage the sun had come back up, I went for a walk and noticed that the moon was still in the ski. I finally had a realization that reality was not the dichotomy of good and evil as in my bad trip and that I simply existed like the moon in the ski. I had managed to break through of the loop in which my thoughts had been running and relax once again into the universe.In a way I think I learnt more about myself from my one bad trip than all my pleasurable things. In a quest for knowledge it's important to accept that some of the best lessons aren't easy to swallow.Hey at least I can say I was a Liquid Acid Guineia pigExp Year: 2002ExpID: 45346Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Feb 15, 2020Views: 935    LSD (2), Ketamine (31) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:  insufflatedCocaine(powder / crystals)   oralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:150 lbThis was my second time doing LSD. We went up to a cabin that my friends had on a lake to do molly and coke with whatever we had. A couple of my friends left to go pick up the drugs it was my buddy I and his gf. We started talking about LSD cause I had just tripped (200ug) for my first time a month prior (keep in mind my first time doing LSD I took half a bar of xanax so I wouldn't have a bad trip). I was talking about how amazing it was. My friend then says hey I got some tabs in my wallet that I don't think I'm going to do want them? The stupid person I was I said hell yeah thinking it would go as good as my first trip (boy was I wrong) so I took them 10 mins later. Our friends came back with coke and molly. I did a line of coke thinking fuck it I'll be good. About 30mins later I started tripping it was pretty chill just staring at the ceiling of the cabin. My friends give me some banter not a big deal used to just them giving me a hard time and fucking around. Then it was time for us to leave prob like 3am at this point. So I get in the car in the back seat I can't see the road which I think was the main problem for this bad trip. We are out in the middle of nowhere it's raining the driver had like a drink or two which gave me anxiety. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] Mixed with everything else I remember time slowing down in my head I had thought we crashed into a tree or something. I remember looking around the car with the music skipping. I started thinking to myself holy fucking shit this is what death feels like saw all my friends moaning in agony around me I felt a warm sticky substance on my neck which I though was blood and my ribs felt like they were broken. I sat there and thought to myself we are in the middle of nowhere no help is coming. I started thinking about how I've done nothing with my life I started thinking about how I've done nothing with my life (18 at the time fresh out of high school). I was scared and left with so much regret and resentment towards myself for not doing anything with my life. That just kept repeating over and over again in my head it felt like hours years even. Until I finally took a breath, the thing around my neck was just my grandmother's necklace which I almost ripped off. I gasped for air told my friend to pull over which he did stood out of the car with my hands on my head. I looked around  and said did we just fucking crash they looked at me in shock replied how hard are you tripping bro. I was liking pretty fucking hard you have no clue what I just experienced. Funny enough 2 of my friends who wanted to do LSD that night for the first time and I bought it for them were in that town which was an hour drive away from where we lived. My buddy was trip sitting so I called him told him what was going on he's like all good bro come to j's house (our friend). Got dropped of there cause I couldn't be in a fucking car any longer. Came through the door note my friends who were on acid didn't know I was coming. I came in lied down on the floor they said Joe how the fuck did you get here. All I said to them was I'm on acid. Those fuckers were mind blown on how I bought them acid 4 hours earlier then they went out of town and then I went out of town with no plans to do acid. Though I somehow showed up there. They were astonished I was having a bad trip but the looks on their face made it all better. Eventually left j's house around 5am I was still terrified of crashing had them stop for like 5 min. Finally worked up myself to trust the trip sitter one of my best friends. He ask Joe where do you want to go I looked at him and said home I need my six my bed as well as my cat. He said alright. Got home trip for another 6 hours felt horrible could sleep till the evening. That trip felt like I went through fucking hell and back but when I was with my friends laying on the floor tripping with them it was the best feeling in the world just vibing off each other. It's been just over a year since all this took place. Do to me thinking I died I had a panic disorder for about 8 months and couldn't wear my grandmother's necklace because it triggered me but I'm probably about 80% recovered now. If done a fuck ton of drugs that year but since 2020 started I've weened myself off them and kept to mainly alcohol cause I landed a very good job making estimated about 60g a year. I still get flashbacks to that trip because I remember it so vividly and find myself questioning if maybe I actually did die in a car accident and that I was already dead. I decided to say fuck it though if I'm already dead then so be it. I've applied for school to go into biochem. I decided to say fuck it though if I'm already dead then so be it. I've applied for school to go into biochem. Everything is looking up for me soon I'll quit partying in general and just focus on school and work. That LSD trip fucked me up but it was a reality check for me over a year later. When I finally realized I need to get my shit together. I don't know if I regret it or not but one thing for sure it helped me toughen up and smarten up about my decisions.

It happened about 2 years ago.  I was on the medication buspirone at the time, and started the prescription a few days before this.This was back when I was homeless in a shelter living in Brooklyn, and my best friend R at the time was hanging out in Staten Island.  I traveled over there to this park that she and her partner C were tripping in.  They were pretty deep into their trip.  R offered me some of her acid, and I asked for like .75 of her super-dosed tab.   What happened next, I was absolutely not prepared for.  We proceeded to make our way up a hill to some building where I went to the bathroom, and after that we started heading back to Brooklyn. Eventually we made our way to Bay Ridge.  I remember we got off the bus after the Verrazzano Bridge, we went into a 7/11 and got some drinks I believe.  By this time, I started to feel the acid kick in a bit, and I started feeling happy and energetic.  I was skipping around a bit on the street.  We made our way to this park next to the Belt Parkway.  We stayed there for a while, hanging out.Eventually R's partner C left us alone, because he wanted to go home, and they were both coming down from their trip.  We were just hanging out talking about various things.  I think I remember talking about ADHD and R's adderall use a bit.  Also about how she liked to microdose acid some of the time to help get things done apparently.  She was a much more experienced drug user than me at the time.  I was still a novice to a lot of it.I remember that we eventually went to sit down in the grass. During that time, I remember saying that I really wanted to kiss R.  I have had a crush on her previously in the past, and she just ignored that, obviously because we wanted to stay friends.  The acid just decreased my inhibitions I suppose, and then I started talking about how I felt that I felt like we were sisters.  Eventually I remember getting cold and anxious, and wanting to go home, so we started getting up.At this point the visuals started kicking in quite a bit.  I started to get overwhelmed from them, especially from hearing the cars pass by.  I would get really intense jitters from the overwhelming anxiety that the highway caused me.  We started heading back, but the anxiety just kept getting worse as I kept coming up.  At one point, R sat down in the middle of a field outside the park and snorted some ketamine.  She offered me a line, but I refused, thinking that I was on enough drugs already, and I was not prepared to try a new drug in that state.  In retrospect, taking it might have been a good idea, as dissociatives can help with anxiety.So after that, she packed her stuff back up and we started walking out of the park.  I remember seeing the ramp we were walking up bending and twisting a lot, and this got me more anxious.  Walking did as well.  I felt like I was extremely high on weed, and on the verge of having a panic attack.We left the park and got into the street.  We were trying to get home, which was over in Park Slope, but that quite a ways away.  We decided to try to walk it.  In retrospect, that was probably a bad idea, but also who knew what would have awaited us in a bus station late at night.  Probably not too much, but who knows.Anyway, we were walking by some people outside of a bar, who were obviously very drunk.  I was afraid of them, and I tried holding R's hand.  Because we were both girls, I felt like the drunk people were judging us, and I was insanely worried about that.  I am not sure if they actually said it, but I thought I heard them say "look at those f**s", or something along those lines.  Immediately, I started panicking a bit in my mind, and I turned down the street on the left.  I started becoming less and less connected to reality, and was losing awareness of my sense of self.  I remember seeing a bunch of really flowy closed eye visuals probably, but I didn't even know what eyes were at the time.  I just thought that my memory was lapsing.I felt really panicky, and I tried listening to my heart.  I was having lapses in memory, and I had no idea what was going on.  I started trying to feel my heartbeat, and I assumed I was having a heart attack.  After that, I got increasingly more delusional about it.  At one point I ran into some random person on the street, and R explained to him that I had just taken acid and that I was just having a bad reaction to it, but I didn't know that at the time.  I just kept getting more and more psychotic and delusional.  R tried to assure me that I was fine and that I was just on drugs, but I kept thinking that I was dying, and that I had to go to the hospital.  I didn't trust her.  I thought she was ignorant of my calls for help and that I was dying.  I got increasingly more agitated and anxious about it.  I had hallucinations and heard a pinging sound which scared me even more and made me assume that I was dying.  I saw red flashes around my vision.  I remember screaming in the street, running around in this suburban area.  R was extremely concerned about me, and tried to help me as best as she could, but I wouldn't listen.  I kept arguing with her about the Good Samaritan Act, and saying that they couldn't arrest me for this.  I fought with R over my purse and my own things.  I would keep running around trying to signal to someone to help me.  I thought that no one cared, but I had to make people care.  I remember banging on the doors of random houses, trying to get them to call 911.  Eventually, someone did, and thank god they took me to the hospital instead of to jail.  While people were talking, I was paralyzed with fear and sure that I was dying.  I was put in an ambulance, and R left to go on her own adventures, which I can't blame her for.  I felt like this experience put some distance between us.  It was probably somewhat traumatizing for her.  I was taken to the hospital and given some pills that stopped me from tripping.  I remember feeling incredibly judged by everyone there.  They were all laughing at me, and I think someone misgendered me and I got really focused on that, but they probably gave me some valium and I was just not really caring about it anymore.  I just wanted to leave.Eventually, sometime in the morning, they discharged me.  I got back to my shelter after a long night, wishing that none of this had ever happened.  I hadn't talked to R for a bit after this, and I suspected she just didn't want to talk to me anymore because I was unstable.  A lot of it was probably just my paranoia and untreated mental health problems, because she had been through some shit too, and she was probably just not a very reliable person because of her problems as well.Anyway, this trip cost me a lot of things.  I lost my purse, and thus my wallet because of this trip, and I had to recover quite a few documents over the course of the next months.  I tried to go back and retrieve my stuff the next day, but most of it was missing.  I was able to recover some things that I lost in that area, though.  I think I lost a few dollars from it, but nothing too bad. The trip itself was rather traumatizing though.  I just fought the experience so much, and I kept trying to control it, and everything around me, but it just lead to me getting admitted to the damn hospital.  At least afterwards, I did learn a lot about how to control myself when under the influence of substances.  I did a ton of research on harm reduction, as I felt these drugs were great tools to help with healing and insight, and I wanted to utilize them the best that I could.  During future trips, I was much better at dealing with the experience.  I also learned to not trust doctors and hospitals and the authorities nearly as much as I did before.  Intellectually, I am and was an anarchist, and I hated the police, but this experience, along with my previous acid trip, made me realize that none of them were to be trusted, and at most I should be skeptical of them if I need their services.  Sometimes they can be good, but I should always take precautions with drugs that can induce ego death.Exp Year: 2017ExpID: 113697Gender: Female Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Mar 14, 2020Views: 806    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Public Space (Museum, Park, etc) (53) DOSE:2 dropsoralLSD    Tobacco - CigarettesBODY WEIGHT:170 lbI have since, and almost immediately did,  come to understand what went wrong, and that I am, and was, OK.Hippie music festival, Labor Day 2009. After not getting much sleep the night before due to travel, my friends and I decide to take some liquid LSD. It was tried previously by the man that brought it, a close friend, and we knew it was good. I have also been taking LSD for some years and  no novice to the grip that it can have. I decided to have 2 hits, administered to my palm and then licked.The crescendo to the peak was more intense than any peak I’ve ever had. Two female friends of mine who both took one hit and I were very laughy about the melting feeling we were experiencing.  That is until the melting became too much to handle. I literally felt as if I was growing roots and was becoming part of the ground.  Melting right into the ground.That is when I began to fight it. The act on stage was a few well known rappers and the negativity of their set combined with the audio being off ( as I was to discover later ) made things all the worse. Things began to fade. I began to assume that the rooting to the ground feeling was what it felt like to die. Soon enough a friend of mine helped me off the ground and pulled me back for a moment. I felt as if she was ripping my roots from the soil itself. I had enough time for me to tell her, “I’m hanging on by a thread here Michelle.” That is the last thing I remember saying for sure, for the next hour or so. I was told that I began to shed my clothes and stripped down to a wife beater and jeans in central NY September night time weather. Then I left my friends. What I saw was not what I was doing. What I saw was what my mind wanted to show me. At first all I heard people saying was, “these are just words, nothing we are saying right now matters.” (exact quotes) There was a serious sense that nothing mattered. There was a serious sense that nothing mattered. Soon, that is all that I heard. I remember making it back to the rappers hoping that my favorite band was on and would get me leveled. But they were just rapping, “words, yeah, words.” That is literally what they were saying into their microphones, just the word “words”.Soon enough I had convinced myself that I had died, or was dying and that I needed to fight to stay alive. I saw myself on a gurney, being rushed to an ambulance hearing someone say, “That’s what happens when you do drugs.” Then I found myself at an intersection of a car accident some time later. My friends were all there and I did not have any idea what was going on. Then I figured out that I was in denial and shock after my girlfriend had been killed in a car accident. I dropped to my knees and began to weep ( which I’m sure I did for real in front of a whole mass of people ).  Only to snap out of that and feel as if I might be in hell. Total despair is the only feeling I can sadly associate to this short time.Once that vision passed I began to accept that I was dead, and that it was time to return my soul to where ever it goes. The strangest feeling of death and rebirth began to play out in my mind. The sun set, then it rose. Set, rose. Over and over again this went on. Much like the scene from HG Wells’ Time Machine toward the end of the book. With every sunrise, I seemed to gain strength, warmth. And then the sun would not come, and the people began to speak negatively once again. In a sudden fit of sanity, I asked a man for a cigarette. I clearly remember him asking for 5$. I said “no”. Then he asked for 10$, I said “no” again. I got the cigarette. They must have taken some pity on me, fore they lit the smoke for me. By doing this my body screamed to my brain that I was freezing. It must have been the warmth of the lighter. Through pure willpower  I made it back to my tent and my jacket  and tried to get a close friend to level me out. He was very drunk and no help. I even remember telling him that I really needed him. I needed him to level me out. But I just put my sweater on and followed a friend of a friend I had met that night back to the show.  At least now warm. The band was on, drum solos from the drummers. I began to gain a bit of my senses back and figured out that I had to pee. I made it back to the stage just in time for Buster to save me from my own awful thoughts. By pure chance a close friend saw me and grabbed me and took me to the rest of the group. They were obviously worried but I needed them to do nothing but hug me. I was to later discover, part by flashes of what happened and part by talking to a security guard that was watching me THE WHOLE TIME, that I spent that time walking from the center of the festival camping area where a large light was, through the VIP area to the side gate mumbling to myself. I saw him later after I leveled out and he asked me to “get out of the VIP area, please, for god’s sake” I said to him, “you have said this to me before haven’t you”.  He said, “Yes, all night you have been walking from that light to the gate mumbling to yourself, please stay out of VIP”.  I thanked him for not kicking my ass to which he said, “You were obviously in bad shape earlier. I would never hurt someone as lost as you seemed. But you were OK, you just walked from there to there mumbling, nothing else.” I don’t remember ANY of that! But that made me feel a lot better.The rest of the night ended up being a great time. Other than finding my cousin crying and nearly shitting himself (he took 3).  Getting him back to camp and to a bathroom was in my capacity at this point. I do not blame the drug for all of this. It was irresponsible for me to ingest psychoactives as tired as I was. It was irresponsible for me to ingest psychoactives as tired as I was. Especially a very potent one. I was worried, of course. But I also knew that this happens. It almost goes with the territory. 15 years and this is the 1st time I’ve had a bad trip.  I learned a lesson about moderation, and that the older you get the more careful you must be.  Did I do the same stuff the rest of the weekend, yes. Call me dumb, but I was much more careful and made sure to get sleep and drink lots of water. And I also made sure to stay warm. It’s funny how the vision of the sunrise sparked the need for warmth. Which started the slow process of my sanity returning.Exp Year: 2009ExpID: 82394Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 29 Published: Mar 23, 2020Views: 812    LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Festival / Lg.

Everything was just fine, actually I never felt as good as I did, I could see the dance floor from far away, it was calling on me like if I got there I would be in heaven I would explode with positive energy! And I started walking toward it, but I as I was walking I saw fires everywhere in front of the tents of people and I decided to stop for 1 min. And I had the misfortune to sit at somebody's fire who wasn't so nice, he told to his friend that he didn't want no trashy sitting at their fire and I heard that! I felt  some negative energy and stood up and walked away and as I was walking everything had changed from heaven to hell, I felt I was cold and everything was so dark and scary.. So I hurried to the dance floor thinking everything will be better but when I got there,  It didn't get better, it got worse I thought I was in hell, I was trying to reach the light in my mind but I couldn't, and as soon I failed I heard voices of people laughing as soon as I lost the light, ha..ha .. And I was thinking that if I left the dance floor in that state, I would be in hell for ever and ever! So I tried and tried but I didn't manage, so I went to my tent and I put some wood on the fire and eventually the flames calmed me down, and I started to feel better, but I still think of the experience I had to this day, if it has any truth in it...I think we create our own reality based on what we know, on what we have learned.. So if I think positive I will feel as I think..good! My bad trip started from the bad energy I felt from that guy who called me a trashy and made me feel unwelcome.

The world is at a standstill due to coronavirus, and I am gifted with boredom and much time to kill. I am writing this report through my best recollections, of the earth shattering and life changing trip I took, when I was 18 years old Every person I have ever told this story to concurs that it’s an epic story. Many find it funny, despite the fact that I nearly died…. Honestly, now at almost 10 years later…so do I.NOTE: All timestamps posted are rough estimations. I remember that day very well. When I left the house, and when I got home from the hospital are still clear in my mind.It was very early in May, and we had recently hit a dreadful cold-snap, where it was -8C the night prior. However, May was beginning to take hold of the season. The buds were forming on trees, the grass was green, and small amounts of foliage were springing to life once again…. That day turned out to be the first very hot day of spring. And somehow, over the course of 48 hours, the temperature had risen to be at least 27c. It had just stormed like crazy, so the humidity was quite extreme.                                              ~~~~PERSONAL DETAILS~~~~gender: MaleAge: 18Weight: skinny, I’m guessing like 160lbsHeight: 6’3”Prior drug experience: Cannabis, hash, LSD, Mushrooms, 2cb, speed, meth, ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, MDA, hydromorphone, PCP, morphine, codeine, alcohol, tobacco, diphenhydramineDrug use prior to the trip: I was a regular cigarette smoker, chronic pothead, and loved psychedelics. I was on a serious bender where I was abusing speed and barely sleeping for at least 4 days I was on a serious bender where I was abusing speed and barely sleeping for at least 4 days, and less than 48 hours prior was out all night getting drunk at an MDMA party… very sleep deprived.Stomach: emptyT-7:30am: I had barely slept the night before, and was not ready to start recovering from the rager of a party I attended. Neither was my friend Sean, he invited me over right at the crack of dawn. I didn’t have much money and got the bright idea to bring some LSD and 2c-B I was saving.I was about to head out the door wearing a T-shirt and jeans, when I remembered how fucking cold it was. I opened the door and noticed it was only 1 or 2 celsius; spitting rain and howling wind. I quickly retreated, and changed into black jeans. I put on an undershirt, followed by a t-shirt, and put on a black hoodie over top of it. I got 5 steps out the door and the wind bit right through me, so I put on a leather jacket and a black toque.T-7:40: (He lived literally 5 minutes from my house) I let myself into his house, which reeked like old bong and cigarettes, and he greeted me with a beer. He played some gangsta rap while we started to crush our way through his 12 pack of Budweiser he had. I remember the beer was warm. This fucking guy was a slob. His whole family barely cleaned or tidied anything. He never put his beers in the fridge despite having a beer-fridge, and he never changed his black-syrup excuse for bongwater…. I changed the water as per usual. Afterwards I put on some punk and metal as we cracked jokes, and proceeded to rip disgusting poppers out of his bong. (a popper is Ontario slang for a piece of a cigarette in a bowl-stem, with weed packed on top)Some time had passed, and I drew his attention to the drugs I had brought over. We loved tripping and were both very excited. I had NEVER mixed 2cb with acid, but it seemed like a great idea at the time. We had roughly 2 tabs each, as well as roughly 20mg of 2cb (pills which we crushed up into parachutes…for some reason)T-???: The drugs were hitting us HARD, I was sweating bricks, and found communication very difficult. Waves of anxious chills began to wash over me. I became very distant and I began tripping harder than I ever had in my life. We decided we needed weed, because we were both freaking out. Sean says he needs to shower to calm down and abandons me in his basement. I begin levelling out, but his basement is gross, messy, dirty, dark, and cold. 30 minutes later he comes down in a full tuxedo (he was saving it for our senior prom). He had a red necktie and an Elvis Presley haircut, so I made some joke about him being Agent 47 from Hitman’s gay cousin. We both seemed to plateau to a less chaotic place, but one thing was certain.. we NEEDED weed.T+10:30- My best friend was in deep with the Hells Angels, and was trafficking unbelievable amounts of pot for a kid his age; we’ll just call him E. He arrived and made fun of us for seeming so high; we got stoned and bought our weed. E proposes to take us out for Tim Hortons, and drive us around while he made some drops. This offer had me ecstatic, because I hated being in that dark, shitty-smelling basement. My stomach was beginning to eat itself; and I could see through Sean’s only window, that the sun was out. The 2c-B was kicking in very hard and I needed to move before my trip went south.~NOTE: All time between now and when I came home from the hospital is a complete blur (I accidentally left my phone at Sean’s house). Little did I know I was about to reach the darkest, most depraved depths of insanity and physical agony one can fathom.H.P. Lovecraft would eat his heart out if he knew the revolting horror about to be unleashed on my psyche. This event was life changing, and fucked me up for MONTHS afterwards…. I indefinitely have permanent brain damage as a result.~We quit stalling, and decided to hit the road. I did not even realize how high I was, until I started moving. I had a weird sense of vertigo, and an odd sense of underwhelming anxiety. I started to ask myself if I bit off more drugs than I could chew; but I didn’t want to feed into that silent dread building up in me. I found comfort in knowing that we would soon be in a different environment. A sudden wave of electrical energy took over me. My field of vision was now made up completely of hallucinations and fractals. My thoughts started to loop themselves in nonsensical ways. “Fucking awesome”, I thought to myself. At this point, I have absolutely no idea what went through my mind. I became one with the fluctuating machinescape of an environment before me. My friends’ voices became an electronic jumble of cacophonous sounds. A sudden dissolution of my thoughts occurred. I knew we were getting ready to head out the door, but from this point on I began running on autopilot. At some point between the basement, his stairs, and his front hallway, my ego died. I forgot my own name and everything else about my life.Little did I know, the high humidity and sun had elevated the temperature outside drastically. I had all my layers I left my house with, and I had my shoes on. Silently without saying anything, I headed out the door. I dismissed myself from my friends without saying a word. Not sure what went on in my head when I did this, but I just started walking…and walking.My friends were getting into E’s car and noticed I continued to walk down his street. Repeatedly they tried to get my attention, but I silently just faded into the distance. Sean laughed and said “he’s too high, probably just gunna go chill at his house” and they left me to it.The sun was evaporating the water from the storm; creating a beautiful mist that was weaving through the intricate geometry. I know I was sweating bricks; I had been for a while. Everything was beautiful, almost as though I was in a land of nirvana. I continued to walk, completely and utterly lost in my own neighborhood; for what seemed like eternity but was most likely around 4 hours. I did not realize this spike in temperature all around me. My clothes were drenched in sweat, and I was becoming nauseous and dizzy.Eventually, I found myself deep in the forest beside my old house from when I was a child. I haven’t live in that area for roughly 3 years at that point. And from here my trip took a very dark turn. I had no idea where I was.I felt like I was just a baby. With no way of knowing what is going on, confused, afraid, and just about ready to shit and puke simultaneously. Suddenly my tongue went completely numb, with pins and needles. I was struck with this sudden sense of urgent fear. I knew something was very wrong and I started to snap out of it a little bit. I’m in the middle of a scary fucking dead forest and have no idea where I am! I’m overwhelmed by a nauseous migraine, and I need to get home because I feel like I might die out here.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~NOTE: I am extremely arachnophobic~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Panic started setting in. I don’t know how to describe this feeling any better, but there was this feeling like I was being watched (hunted… think Evil Dead). Something was out to get me. Suddenly, all I could smell was the putrid stench of feces and rotting flesh. I puked violently, and noticed the entire ground I was walking on, was swarming with creepy crawlies. Centipedes, snakes, and tarantulas were crawling everywhere. Underneath every dead leaf on the ground were trap-door spiders, they kept popping out in attack position and receding. I had completely forgotten I had taken drugs earlier that day. I was petrified in fear and began to cry. Sobbing uncontrollably like a little child, the stench was overwhelming and growing stronger, and my chest was pounding like I was about to die. I vomit again, this time in a very painful way. It felt like my eyeballs and prostate exploded from pressure. The pain dropped me to my knees, and when I dropped on the ground it was game over. All at once, each and every trap-door spider on the ground (I’m talking hundreds maybe thousands), leaped all over me. Crawling all over and devouring me. I could hear them crawling and hissing, I could feel them covering me underneath my clothes. I was covered in pins and needles, and tarantulas were crawling on my balls. I panicked, violently thrashing around on the ground. I began screaming as loud as I could in sheer terror, and frantically ripped off all my clothes. I got ass-naked, and started throwing my clothes around; smacking them against trees, and using them to defend myself from these evil spiders. It was too late, the spiders had infected me underneath my skin, crawling beneath my flesh and feeding on me. They made their way up into my brain, which must have been in rough shape, because my migraine had become scalding and unbearable.These spiders had all conglomerated into one big, evil fucking spider. Go on Google Images, and look up a funnel web spider. It looked just like that. To this day, I am almost certain I opened some sort of metaphysical gate into the unknown; and this thing was in fact, a malevolent autonomous entity, that was trying to take my soul. I could see clear as day, right in front of me, all the damage this spider was doing to my brain. This must have been a minds-eye hallucination, because it was so vivid and real. The stench was still present, and all I could taste was a bitter, metallic flavour. I vomited again, this time effecting great pain throughout my gut and I popped a hemorrhoid in my ass. This spider was crawling all over my brain, pulling apart at my wires with its fangs, and inflicting horrible pain. Each time it bit me, brought a new intrusive thought. These thoughts were horrible, unspeakable things. Everything from necrophilia, gore, torture/mutilation, to PTSD flashbacks of me being raped as a kid. It felt like I was being brutally raped and force-fed shit. All the while, this evil spider was screaming at me in this dark alien language, comprised of hissing and clicking… it was transmitting telepathic thoughts… telling me it was only going to stop inflicting such pain and torture, if I killed my loved ones.Needless to say I fucking lost it. I screamed harder and more hysterically than I have ever screamed before. I started sprinting all over with total disregard to the paths around me through the woods I was lost in. My heart was POUNDING. Eventually I broke through the bush into a new path and came across a man walking his dog. He must have heard me coming for miles, only to behold a naked teenager screaming and sobbing hysterically, begging for help.I saw him, and pitifully collapsed to the ground, begging for him- “PLEASE FUCKING HELP ME OH GOD PLEASE MISTER PLEASE HELP ME!” screaming in hysterics…. this fucking guy… avoided all eye-contact… hushed his dog closer, and COMPLETELY ignored me. He must have been fucking terrified… this wasn’t a hallucination; there really was some old man and his dog that just walked right past as I was writhing on the ground. I vomit again in front of him, dry-heaving painfully and shat all over myself and the ground. I rolled all around my poo like I was on fire; while this spider penetrated deeper into my soul, and infected me with evil. The stench was unbearable now. I screamed helplessly and pleading this old man as he just walked right past me. As he walked past, his head turned all the way around like the exorcist and began rotting away as it formed a devilish smile.I was trapped in hell, and this spider was raping my soul. I felt death closing in, so I picked my ass off the ground and began running and screaming again. I was sprinting off the path, and eventually came across an area that was made up of bramble bushes, entangle in vines. The sun was shining through the other side of them. So I booked it as hard as I could, trying to get through them…. Low and behold I got tangled in that mess. Now there was an entirely new level of pain being inflicted on me, as these bushes and vines were very thick. It was almost impossible to get through. While these thorns wrapped their way around my naked body, cutting me underneath my armpits, my legs; you name it. The more I fought them the more entangled I became. Trying to run through a fucking bramble bush while naked, is an exercise in futility. I came back to that same spot weeks later, and the fucking path leading out of the forest was RIGHT BESIDE WHERE I WAS. These thorns were slicing me up all over. They ripped at my scrotum and I got sliced right at the trip of my dick-hole. I had cuts dangerously close to my jugular… eventually it came to a point, where I was literally suspended. almost upside down. I was trapped in this spiders web of despair… literally suspended and COVERED head to toe in sweat, shit, vomit, blood and tears. Crying painfully and blinded by agony as this spider began to feed on me. My eyes felt like they were bursting out of my skull. FINALLY, I broke free! I crawled my way out of that mess, into the open sunlight. The sunlight paired with finding myself outside of the never-ending forest, seemed to burn the spider away. The sun was bright and not helping my migraine, but it seemed to kill this evil spider; almost like it was a vampire. I saw a familiar busy road with cars, which began honking at me. I was still ass naked, and covered in blood and shit and vomit. I looked down at my bleeding dick and noticed something truly amazing.THIS ENTIRE TIME, my hoodie and jeans were locked into my hand. Death-gripped like I was clinging to them for dear life (I was). Thank fuck, I thought to myself. I frantically put my pants and sweater back on. Put my hood up and realized I wasn’t very far from my house.I was still crying hysterically, sobbing like I had been raped (I may as well have been raped by pure evil) and began making my way home. I was crying so hard and stumbling with blood all over my face. Everyone doing their yard work slowly started to notice me. This freaked me out, because they looked at me like they knew exactly who I was; it was my neighborhood after all. They definitely had seen me walking around before. I was almost there; I came to the top of the hill, on the road my street was off of. I could almost see my house. At the top of this hill there was a white church. “I made it, I’m alive” I thought to myself as I passed the church.As I was passing this church though, about halfway, I vomited yet again. This time was very different. The pain I vomited forth was INDESCRIBABLE. I dry-heaved blood, as it felt like my stomach and entire digestive track had folded itself inside out in my esophagus. My eyeballs popped (I had huge red spider web veins across my eyes for a few days) and my prostate felt like it had been ripped out of my ass. It didn’t stop there. My whole body was drenched in pins and needles, and it felt like I was burning alive. Like every nerve ending was simultaneously being scalded. This pain dropped me on the ground and caused me to scream so loud it, felt like it broke my voice-box; making the pain ten times worse. I lay on the ground convulsing and may have shat myself again. I cried out for help but nobody was outside. I screamed for my mother, for god, for my girlfriend and anything to save me.My attention then turned to the church. In the field was a very fat lady on a riding mower, while little children played behind her as she drove; with butterfly nets, trying to catch little bugs. I saw the sun shining behind the crucifix on its roof. “God, please save me!! Sanctuary!! oh god help me please god!!!” I thought, as I limped as fast as I could towards the fat lady. I vomited again and the pain was worse, I collapsed no less than 4 feet behind them all; screaming bloody murder for them to help me. I shit my pants.The thing about these kind of lawnmowers…. Is they are very loud. Not one of them heard me, even though they were literally just out of my hands grasp. “WHAT THE FUCK GOD!?” this felt like I had been completely forsaken. “FUCK THIS!!” I picked myself up off the ground and limped away from the church towards the rows of houses. I made it to the first house, and began banging on the door and frantically ringing the doorbell; screaming that I needed an ambulance. I must have been there for 3 minutes. The house was empty, I went next door and did the same thing… also empty. I went to another house and did the exact same thing….also empty! Now I started believing that I had never escaped. That I was just a spectre of pain and agony, doomed to live forever in that state of torture…. The hissing of the spider was back, and laughing demonically.I went to the next house…ALSO EMPTY…I’m guessing a lot of people were still at work… if I had to guess the time I would say 4pm. I finally broke down crying more painfully than I had in the forest. Sobbing like a baby, whose mother abandoned him in the snow and left him to die. I screamed with all my strength a final time. If I wasn’t already dead and in hell, I gave up and accepted death. Suddenly I heard my name being called from a distance. Low and behold was the head of student council at my high school (Kareem), with a total smoke-show of a girl walking towards me. This caused a new found surge of adrenaline to course through me. I was not ready to die! I frantically got up and made it to them as fast as I could, before vomiting even more pain. I began convulsing, they were terrified. Apparently they heard me from inside their house, many houses down the block; and followed my screams. They knew something horrible was wrong, and Kareem was holding a bottle of water. He immediately jumped to my aid, and started feeding me water from the bottle.It felt like my stomach was being stretched past its capacity trying to drink it. I definitely needed that. My throat burned. They were pleading with me to tell them what was going on. I told them I did drugs and frantically tried to explain what had happened in the forest. Kareem was a nerd but he still did drugs. He tried to calm me, telling me it was going to be okay and I shouted “NO IT’S FUCKING NOT GOING TO BE OKAY” and started screaming and crying hysterically. I shit my pants violently, right in front of them.The girl's mom came outside very alarmed, and tried to help me as well. She asked what drugs I did. I told her acid… her reply was like, “LSD? Don’t worry I’m from the 60’s! I can help you brother!!” This would have been very calming, but the level of pain I was in was astounding. They force-fed me ice-water, and it made everything worse. I was still screaming and rolling on the ground. Destroying her front lawn and ripping at all the grass.I had attracted a very large crowd at this point. One other lady knew I was on drugs (maybe she was also from the 60’s), and started shewing people away. Her mother and the lady decided they had to get me out of public…. So they had the bright idea OF TRAPPING ME IN THEIR FUCKING SWELTERING HOT CAR. They locked the doors and started frantically discussing what to do with me. This heat was unbearable. I was burning alive, and my heart was beating out of my chest. I vomit in her car and started panicking and trying to kick my way out. They pulled me out of the car and got more water. At this point she had had enough, and called the police. They showed up around 5 minutes later, and began rough-handling me into handcuffs. I was blacking out due to fear. These were not cops; these were minions of the spider, trying to gang-rape me. I did not comply; they called for back-up. The amount of fight-or-flight adrenalin coursing through me must have given me the strength of 10 men; because it took 6 officers to apprehend me. They pepper sprayed me and kicked the shit out of me. Somewhere in this scuffle, I threw an insult at an officer and grabbed his gun. They proceeded to stomp the living hell out of me, soak my eyes in mace, and taser me. This was so bad that the mom who called the police, started screaming at them to call an ambulance. I said something to one of the cops, who proceeded to empty an entire can of pepper spray on me while I was cuffed on the ground.Now, after this point, I truly went to hell. It was like I had been erased from history and existence. And banished to a realm of pure darkness…. I don’t mean close your eyes and see static sort of darkness, just sheer blackness. I was damned to float through the void, for all of eternity; experiencing pain beyond the human spectrum. At which point the ambulance arrived. According to paramedics I was screaming up bubbles of blood spatter. They poured water on my eyes, strapped me to a stretcher, and they shoved me in the back of the ambulance…. I had regained some of my vision just in time to see the malevolent, torturing demons cutting off all my clothes, and shoving catheters into my arms. Completely apprehended, they hooked up something that was reading my pulse. Holy fuck that thing was counting fast, my heart really was beating out of its chest. This sound made everything worse.I remember one paramedic forcing a mask on my beaten up face in a painful manner; and flexing oxygen into my lungs. Each time he was SCREAMING for me to “Breathe! Breathe!! Breathe!!”…. obviously this did not help my panic…. It actually made it 10 times worse. I could hear my heart rate rising to excessive levels before I almost died of fear. It began causing palpitations and going back to concerning speed. Something was injected into me and it returned to normal. A wave of calm washed over me. At which point I was able to breath, and collect myself enough to tell the paramedic shouting at me to fuck off. They noticed I stopped trying to break free of the restraints, and eased up a little. One of the police officers was lying on top of my legs. I sobbed pathetically and begged them not to kill me. The cop who was previously beating the shit out of me, must have had some change of heart. He started slowly rising up off my legs.“It’s okay buddy, we’re not…gunna hurt you”… as soon as I got one leg free I kicked him as hard as I could in the face (broke his nose), and my feet just started flying. The last thing I remember hearing was “SEDATE HIM!! SEDATE HIM!!!” and subsequently, a hypodermic needle was put into my temple.I came to, many hours later in a hospital bed. I woke up like Neo in The Matrix. There were tubes all over me. A tube down my throat, in my arms, and a tube up my bloody dickhole. In a confused panic I pulled out my feed tube and started tearing out the things in my arms. I pulled off the suction cup thingies reading my pulse, and at once a doctor came sprinting down the hall. “if you pull out that catheter there’s gunna be blood!!” he shouted “whats a catheter??” I shouted as I proceeded to rip the catheter halfway out of my dickhole by the bag it was attached to. There was air in this bag and I shoved a bunch of it up my dickhole. The pain was scalding! It was like giving birth, out of your dick!He was angry with me, told me to stay put until he got a nurse to speak with me“are you god??” I asked him, still clearly high as a kite.He did not answer; shortly after a Nurse arrived with a clipboard. “Are you god?” I asked. “No” she replied, visibly flustered. She then proceeded to tell me how I ended up in the hospital, and it all came back to me. I was plagued with this overwhelming shame and embarrassment. She told me all the drugs she found in my urine, I had to explain what 2c-b was to her. She then told me my internal organs were literally cooking inside of my skin, and I was going into cardiac arrest. I had almost died of heatstroke and dehydration. According to her, almost every patient who goes in like me ends up dying; and they almost lost me.I had to wait hours, before they got a hold of my parents to pick me up. Boy fuck, were they ever mad. The same nurse went up to me and lifted up my gown with no warning, and proceeded to grab my cock by the shaft. She explained she was taking out my catheter so they could send me home. She said it wouldn’t hurt, and that it was just going to be a little pinch. She lied, obviously. I think it ripped a bit of dick-scab with it cuz my cock was bloody afterwards. Very painful would not recommend….. My parents picked me up. They dropped me off at Sean’s house so I could grab my cellphone. I barged into his house wearing nothing but a hospital gown, with my butt-cheeks expose. I walked past his very alarmed mother, down into his basement. As I walked in I saw Sean, as he was pulling a popper through his bong; still in a classy tuxedo. He looked at me very perplexed, with that sort of face you make holding in a fat bong rip. His eyes widened, “What the fuck happened to you man?” “I went completely insane, got raped and tortured by spiders before cops beat the living piss out of me and stole my weed”, I replied. “Jesus fucking Christ buddy, want a bong toke?” Of course I did. He had some nugs of weed on his cluttered desk. “I’m taking these” I said as I scooped them up. He busted out laughing, “are you sure you don’t want your cellphone?” I then noticed my phone was right beside me on the table. I took my phone and left without saying anything. “What the fuck happened to you??” said Sean’s mother, as my horribly cut up ass-cheeks walked out her door.T+9:30pm – I arrived back home, and ate scrambled eggs. I was still hallucinating, my throat felt like I swallowed razor blades, and I felt very weak. I remember walking upstairs to shower. I took a very painful piss, which ended with dick-farts bubbling out of my penis. “Holy fuck” I thought to myself.I hopped in the shower and cried. I then crawled into bed, turned off the lights, and cried. I called my girlfriend and told her what happened. She was upset I didn’t call her; I cried. I tried to sleep but nothing came.For almost 2 weeks I felt braindead, completely depleted of energy. And shame and depression plagued my mind. For almost 2 weeks I felt braindead, completely depleted of energy. And shame and depression plagued my mind. I realized things I was avoiding due to how they made me feel, and all my prior depression seemed meaningless. For almost a month I could get phantom pains just thinking about it, and the spider’s image of itself eating my brain, was fresh in my mind. I became scared shitless of everything. I quit all substances, and focused on my school. Crazy how going to hell and back, can really change your perspective on life eh?Many months - almost a year down the line, I attempted to trip acid again with my girlfriend. It was a great time. I have learned many lessons from this experience. I do not regret it, nor would I wish this experience on my worst enemy. Never doubt the power of these drugs, or be as irresponsible as I was. You may end up losing your life, or even your soul.Exp Year: 2010ExpID: 114237Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 18 Published: Apr 16, 2020Views: 3,105    2C-B (52), LSD (2) : Various (28), Entities / Beings (37), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(edible / food)BODY WEIGHT:160 lbThis was my first time, after about a year of looking. I've done mushrooms, E, 2ci. I took it at my friend's house and we drove into DC with his wife and kid (I call him Tuck-a-bee, or Blee, or sometimes Ta-koon). It hit fast, 20 mintues in. It felt like the onset of mushrooms, but not only was it messing with my visual and conceptual frames, it was also 'twisting' my body. Hilarity hit and stayed a while. On the ride out, the kid kept asking for a scary story. I'd try to start, but get lost and get distracted by something else. (First mistake was to take it with a 3-year old around who wants alot of attention. I found this stuff made concentration difficult.) Second mistake was to go into public. I became intensely worried about maintaining decorum, which darkened the trip here and there. I couldn't just relax, which would have been nice. About 2.5 hours in, when we returned to our hometown, the trip continued but the jarring intensity was gone. I could soberly survey my thoughts, I didn't have that sense of being overpowered. However, things were still different and interesting.We went to the mall and saw a friend. For whatever reason, I thought I saw alot of deformed faces in the mall. People were uglier than usual. Alot of people say stick with mushrooms, and I see their point. My times on mushrooms were similar but also were accompanied by a deep warm euphoria that I lacked on LSD. Also, someone told me that keeping your shit together on LSD is a constant task, and I think that's probably true, it was for me this time anyways.Next time I'm going to do it solo or just with one friend and not in public. In public it's too confusing and I loose valuable time worrying.Exp Year: 2003ExpID: 28924Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Apr 20, 2020Views: 603    LSD (2) : First Times (2), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Public Space (Museum, Park, etc) (53) DOSE:1 hit LSDBODY WEIGHT:180 lbPrior to this experience I had experimented with a variety of drugs. I had done LSD a handful of times. I had no idea what I was in for on this particular night. On this occasion I was with two friends D & R. We were in a car driving down the main street of our town. D said they had scored some LSD and they were going to drop a hit each. They wanted me to do some too. I was in the military at the time and had to report for duty at the base that night. I knew I would have to stay up all night. I told them this and they told me how good it was, I really needed to do it with them, etc, etc.I really, REALLY wanted to, but in the back of my mind I was thinking about my obligations. I was trying to think of a way I could still partake. I rationalized I may be down from the hallucinations by the time I had to leave. The up feeling would also help me stay up all night. They were still insisting, so I made a proposition to my friend D. I said if you go with me & stay up all night to keep me company I’ll drop. I figured I could say my car broke down if anyone asked & that he agreed to give me a ride. He agreed and I took one hit of LSD.[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] The drug started to take effect quickly & I knew I was in for a hell of a ride. I felt very up & things started to distort, colors started to appear. I was still able to comprehend time. I attribute this to the fact that I HAD to keep track of time. Before I knew it, it was time to leave. I couldn’t believe how fast the time went. I told D it was time to go. He looked at me with half closed eyes & said there was no way he was going to make it. I told him he had to, that was the deal. So much for friends being there when you need them. It now reminds me of the Bob Dylan song lyrics; they’ll stone you & then they’ll say good luck. Well, my friends didn’t even wish me luck! I had to drive approximately 20 miles to the base alone, at night, while tripping. I know…..a really bad idea. I was thinking at the time I had no choice (but of course I did). Let me just say there is no excuse for being late in the military, let alone not showing up at all. I start driving and it’s going pretty well…..at first.I had a lot of open road in the beginning, everything was going fine. I had a small town to pass through ahead. There was a stoplight on every corner with lots of people. It seemed like I hit every light red and this was starting to cause anxiety. I just wanted to get through this town. The light in front of me was red & I was stopped at the crosswalk. I was looking at the people crossing in the crosswalk in front of me. I was thinking if they knew how fucked up I was, there’s no way they’d be doing it. Of course they had no idea how high I was and this thought stayed in my mind. I wondered how many times I’d walked in front of peoples cars that were tripping. At this point my windshield stretched out, first one side then the other. It morphed into what looked like a movie theater screen. Everything looked like it was in Technicolor. It seemed like I was watching a movie, people were crossing the street at that exact time in the movie. This started to freak me out because I had to drive. I knew I had to remain calm. The light turned green & I drove. It seemed like everything was on auto pilot. I could tell I was driving OK, it just seemed like everything was on auto pilot. I made it through the town to my relief.Everything was going fine until it happened. This is the trippiest thing that’s ever happened to me while under the influence of any drug. Up ahead in the distance I could see something that didn’t look right, but I couldn’t make it out. As I got closer it looked liked water was pouring out of the sky into the street. I thought this had to be the effect of the drug. I kept trying to make sense of it as I got closer. It looked as if there was a tear in the sky and water was just pouring out of this tear into the middle of the road. It HAD to be an effect of the acid I thought. As I got closer it didn’t change, so I went slower & slower until I was barely rolling. I thought for sure it would just vanish before I got to it.To my surprise water started pounding down on the hood of my car with great force, it was real. I could see nothing until I came out the other side. It was like driving through a car wash. When I came out I saw what had happened. A car had driven off the highway and sheared off a fire hydrant. The fire hydrant was on the backside of the water obscuring it from my view. Now my thought was someone may be injured, so I pulled off the road & parked…..big mistake. I walked up to a group of people standing in a circle & talking next to the accident. I was going to ask them if everyone was OK. At this point the people in the group who were facing away from me turned around. It was then I realized all of them were police officers, their faces were distorted. Now, I realized the predicament I was in. The last thing I wanted to do was to speak to them. They were looking at me like what are you doing here? Good question I thought. I kind of lifted my hand to gesture as if everything is OK and turned to walk back to my car. I just hoped none of them would call out anything to me. They didn’t and I drove off.I had a city to drive through before getting to the base. I felt confident I was going to make it. When I got into the city I was horrified to see a concert was just getting out. There were people and cars everywhere. The worst part was that it seemed there was a policeman in a police car on every other corner. I had to pass the parked police cars knowing I could be stopped at any moment. I was still tripping pretty hard. I made it to the base and to my duty station. My job was to sit at a desk & check in anyone that got there during the night. The whole night I was looking at the door paranoid an officer would walk in and figure it all out. I also had to log entries into a log book with no room for error which gave me great anxiety. Needless to say I didn’t enjoy the rest of my trip.What I learned from this experience is that peer pressure is a powerful force. In the end though my responsibilities are up to me & nobody else is going to handle it for me. I learned that if I'm going to trip I need to make sure I'm in a place where I feel safe and am in a good state of mind.Exp Year: 2004ExpID: 82503Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 20 Published: Apr 24, 2020Views: 1,072    LSD (2) : Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Various (28) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:160 lbThis story that I’m about to share took place not too long ago. I wanted to write about it as soon as possible because the experience is very fresh in my mind. Acid is one of those drugs one absolutely cannot underestimate. No matter how big your ego is, or how tough you think you are, acid will tear it down and bring you to your knees while you grovel in awe of the beauty in the world, all while contemplating deeper thoughts than you thought your brain could muster. And while acid for the most part is a wonderful drug that enhances the subconscious to new dimensional levels, if the right precautions are not taken, the substance can turn on you, and make the world dark, twisted, and terrifying. This latest trip I had gave me glimpses of both sides of the drug, and while for the most part the trip was positive, due to my lack of preparation, I took a peek into the world of the dreaded “bad trip” and am now infinitely more respectful of this molecule because of it. My experience began when my buddy, K, got a text from his acid dealer that he had just got a new shipment of tabs to his house off the deep web. I had had 5 experiences with acid before this I had had 5 experiences with acid before this, the last of which took place about a month and a half before this trip. That last trip had been my highest dosage yet (around 400 ug) and had been overwhelmingly positive for me. Because of this, I was itching to get my hands on some more Lucy and foolishly assumed that this trip couldn’t be any less positive than the one before it. K, my other friend, E, and myself set aside a Saturday to trip on this new batch of acid. We decided we were going to tell our parents we were going over to our other friends house for the day, when in fact we were going to go down to the small beach and park that is a mile or two away from K’s house. I was slightly nervous about this decision because that left us out in the open for the entire trip without a safe house to retreat to, but my ego took over and told me that nothing could ever go wrong with my acid experience because I knew how to handle myself. This was my first big mistake. My next mistake was not eating anything the day of the acid trip. It was around one o’ clock when we dropped and I had not eaten breakfast or lunch and had no sound means of obtaining food for the entire trip. Not believing this would be a factor, I decided it wasn’t a big deal. We dropped in my car which was parked outside of the park by K’s house then decided to take a walk to the beach and come up there. We each took 2 tabs. This was less than my previous acid trip that was extremely positive so I thought I could handle this just fine. Around the 45 minute to an hour mark we began to feel the first effects of our 8 hour endeavor. It started off with a very heavy body load and all of the colors around me looking very bright and HD. I am really not a fan of the acid body load, and began to feel very weighed down. Feelings of anxiety crept into my mind because the body load began to become so intense I could not physically stand upright any longer. I asked my buddies if they minded sitting down for this reason, and they happily obliged. We took a seat on a grassy hill that overlooked the bay and put on some tunes. This was when the hard visuals began to kick in. I remember looking at a tree in the distance that seemed to be swaying in the wind, only there was no wind, the tree was swirling and moving all around almost as if it was alive. I soon began to realize all of the plants around me were doing the same thing, swirling and swaying in counter clockwise circles. Then my whole visual plane began to move, like my vision was a television screen someone was rocking up and down and side to side. Fortunately when the visuals began the body load subsided, and I was able to stand on my feet again. That was when we decided to start walking.Acid gives me an incredible amount of energy, and our walk soon turned into more of a hike. We walked down this very long path for what seemed like 10 minutes but in reality it was more like an hour, all the while my visuals were getting more and more intense. I began to see hovering shapes above the path we were walking on, and people who walked past us looked the same size 100 yards away as opposed to right next to me. The trip so far had been a blast, I was fully enjoying myself and was loving the beauty of the world and all of the insightful thoughts I was thinking. I remember talking intensely about how all of human warfare has just been the perfection of the sharpened stick, and how human progression was absolutely astounding.  We stopped at another part of the beach and my buddies decided to smoke a spliff. I decided to not partake in this because I sometimes get bad anxiety after smoking cannabis and did not want to ruin my experience with the Lucy. As my friends were smoking, I began to feel funny, but I could not quite put my finger on what was wrong. It took me a long while to realize what I was feeling was hunger, and that I really needed to get some food into my system. I told E and K this, and since they had just smoked some maryjane, decided that they probably wanted food as well. We decided the best place to get food was at our friends house who we told our parents we were going to be at, and we began the very long walk to his place. We had reached his street when I had the thought that maybe we should call him and warn him we were going to come over before we just showed up unannounced tripping major balls, and I dialed his cell. I vividly remember the numbers on my phone appearing to be three dimensional, and floating around the screen like sail boats in a pond. Somehow I managed to call him, and told him we needed to come over to grab some food, to which he responded that under no circumstances were we allowed to come over, because he did not want us tripping balls at his house. While this is a semi-reasonable thing for him to say, especially if his parents were home, acid me took that rejection very very badly, and felt terrible that I had even called to ask him to come over. This is where my trip went from overtly pleasurable to downright terrifying. We were stuck. If we went back the way we came, we would not have food, and if we went to the nearest store that had food, we would have to walk another mile or so on major busy streets to get there. Neither of these prospects enthused me, and I began to feel very conflicted on what to do. I decided for the group that we had to get food in our system, as it had now been about 3 and a half hours into our trip and I had not eaten anything all day, and we began the journey to the nearest place to eat. While walking, I began to feel overwhelmingly lethargic, my legs wanted to give out, I was sweating, and my head began to pound. I kept telling my friends how much this walk sucked and how I did not want to continue, but they reminded me that we had to get food and we couldn’t just stop in the middle of the street. While I knew that we couldn’t stop, I kept complaining aloud to my buddies, saying that I’d rather get hit by a car than walk any longer, and that I’d kill to take a shower. E and K kept telling me to stop complaining and to just go with the flow, but I physically couldn’t bring myself to do it. I just kept repeating how I’d rather die than be out in the open any longer, and slowly this statement turned from hyperbole, to an actual thought. Once I realized that I was seriously considering suicide my mind began to panic, wondering why I could not muster the energy to just walk to food like my friends were. At around the same time, the cars that were around us began to sound like jet engines, and the smell of exhaust and dirt overwhelmingly filled my nostrils. I also began to feel incredibly trapped out in the world, and I began to panic over the fact that we did not have a house to retreat to, and I was going to have to wait out the rest of this trip in the dirty, nasty city. Finally we reached a place to eat. I watched as the man who was making me my sandwichs face contorted into grotesque positions, and how the meatballs he was putting into the bread looked utterly disgusting.  I got my food as fast as I could and walked out the door, I had to beg my friends who wanted to sit down in the store because all I wanted to do was get back to the beach where we first began to trip. I started to have paranoid thoughts about my friends, and I thought that they were talking about me behind my back, whispering about how I couldn’t handle my drugs and how they wished I would just leave. This of course was not true, but my paranoid drugged up mind began to resent my two best friends, a feeling which terrified and deeply saddened me. Waves of depression started to wash over my psyche, I have struggled with depression in the past and this felt like that times ten. I thought my only friends hated me, and that I was going to die alone with no connection to anyone in the world. I wanted to go home so badly, and deeply contemplated calling my parents to pick me up, a thought that I hated to even think about. This was when I started to have my first dark visuals, faces on posters and people on the street began to look like skulls, and I kept thinking that there were bees flying around my ears. I also began to feel as if I was badly sunburnt to the point of my face being swollen. I felt ugly and un-presentable to the world, and that everybody was looking at me and judging me. I took maybe two bites of my sandwich, and then threw it away. I tried to focus on my breathing and continue walking towards the beach, but it was an almost impossible task. But somehow, I made it back to the beach where we first started coming up on acid in one piece, and once I was back away from the peering eyes of sober people, off the streets with all of the deafening cars, and with a little bit of food in my stomach, my trip began to ebb back into a positive light with a little bit of food in my stomach, my trip began to ebb back into a positive light. This would not have been possible without the help of my two wonderful friends, who when realizing that I was under serious stress talked to me and kept me calm on the walk back, trying to reassure me that everything was going to be fine and that it would soon be over. This is something I am immensely grateful for. This terrible aspect of the trip that was the worst thing I had ever experienced at the time when looking back on it now has taught me a couple very valuable lessons, number one being to not underestimate the power acid can have over my psyche. Once the molecule takes hold, I am no longer in control, and the drug will take me wherever it wants to take me. Number two is to always have a place to retreat to if the trip becomes too intense, the lack of a safe house caused my drugged brain to believe I had no place in the world, and that I was going to be stuck outside forever. And finally I learned that you gotta eat some damn food before you trip, your body will forget while you’re trippin and you won’t understand why you’re so tired midway through. We were walking for probably over half of this trip, and my legs by the end of the day ached worse than they ever had before.  This is the only time in my experiences with Lucy that a negative side has emerged, but looking back on it, it was exactly what I needed. I now realize what I need to do in order to ensure a fully positive trip, and it checked my ego not only with dropping acid, but my life in general as well. I wanted to share this story not only to entertain, but in hopes that if others read, they can take something away from my experience, and apply it to their own trips in order to make sure nothing unexpected happens.

Should be noted we smoked a few bong hits of weed before dropping. After we dropped, we headed for the road and planned to experience the come up at my friend A’s house. This was also the first time I had double dosed on acid.The road back was more jammed than expected and we were stuck on the road for more than half an hour when our acid begun to hit we were stuck on the road for more than half an hour when our acid begun to hit. Both me and A were enjoying and giggling away because of the initial euphoria and heightened state of senses one experiences on an acid trip. Slowly but surely, we reached the place, it was on the 18th floor and by now even walking to the elevator and waiting for it to rise was such a cool intense experience. Imagination was running wild for me at this point, which should be noted for the upcoming events that is all perceived by me.  Moving on, we arrived at A’s room, dropped everything and I layed on the bed, clearly fried out of my brains because of the peak. My mind was creating whirlwinds with my thoughts, and I was left struggling to keep a calm mind. A was helping me through it, speaking with some encouraging and positive words. It helped. Later, A decided to go for a shower, and I had started to sketch and draw on my notebook. All was going along calmly, my mind had quieted too and I was focused mainly on the subject of art. After A had showered, he appeared with a much more sullen face (not as cheerful as before). I asked what’s wrong with a reply of “nothing”. We brushed it off and started to play some more music, and rolled more weed. Later, A wanted to ask about my family, we started talking about family. The topic came to A’s dad. He had stopped abruptly and started crying. All the while trying (forcefully) to hug me or pull at my hand. It was alright to me, I knew that A was trustable. But then A would stop crying altogether and look me in the eye. When I looked, I noticed that there were no tears, which now was beginning to scare me as I was pondering if A was really crying or not. More conversation about the dad continued, with A stopping right before, “My dad is…” along those lines which indicated to me he did not want to talk about it. So I suggested we stop talking about it as the vibes were beginning to turn dark. A said that I was giving up on him already. More back and forth conversation of me trying to listen and A stopping and being silent in midst of conversation. From this point on, I was trying my hardest to enjoy the trip but A was giving me a hard time to understand the problem in A’s life. I decided to be quiet as well, and was planning to call another friend to meet up instead after A had fallen asleep. To no avail, A suddenly grabbed me in an embrace, A was breathing deep against my neck as if sucking life force out of me as a vampire would suck blood. This freaked me out and I pushed A away prepared to fight or flight. A just laughed and said sorry. Twice again A did the forceful acts, again and again I repelled, each time more anger pent up in me as A’s attitude now looked more like an act than something real. I warned A for the last time that I was really disorientated on the acid and to not disturb me like that anymore. I assured A that I will still be available to talk if he wants to. A relaxed after smoking some weed and now just paced around the room, looking anxious. I was still debating whether or not to leave because for some reason whenever I looked at A’s face, his eyes, mouth, nose, skull, would morph and scarily enough, A looked like a demon. The ones you see in nightmares. I would like to mention, that I felt as if I had crossed paths with this friend for a number of times in past lives. Why this thought came to me I had no idea but after the trip, A revealed to me that it seemed to him I was an Angel of death and he thought that I was here to take his life. I think that notion was incredibly absurd but somehow made sense to me why I saw the demon faced A and the past lives recognition sensation. I am going to end my report here as to not prolong it any longer. Lastly, we both experienced what someone would call a bad trip but have emerged from it more mature and ready to better ourselves from. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people.

The weekend before I took MDMA, 440 mg on Friday, and 220 mg on Saturday. (Poor choice, and not recommended, even at larger body weights)During the week I felt the depressant after effects of the drug due to the large dose, and it manifested itself in a way that I was doubting why I was pursuing the arts as I was and about what I want to do with my life. By Friday, I was feeling pretty close to normal, and since I had already had the LSD sitting in my fridge, I decided to go ahead and make it an event on Saturday. The trip:I thought the 125 ug dose would be too weak for someone of my size so I got the next one up. Little did I know…..T + 0:00 I dropped the blotter at about 12:30 by dissolving it under my tongue for about 15 minutes, and when it had disintegrated swallowed it.T + 0:30 About 30 minutes later I was starting to feel the come up, which was like a mild alcohol intoxication. I decided to buy a pack of cigarettes for the day, and I went through about half the pack in those 12 hours from not smoking for months (which I guess is not unexpected as I usually smoked a pack a day).T + 1:00 I messaged my friend X because I wanted to see him and give him a hug for a good trip while he was at the music festival near my home. I went outside and was not noticing anything visual yet, but I definitely felt the effects of the drug in a euphoric, goofy, smiley kind of way. I remember that the rain started to really upset me so I went back in to my apartment after running into X, as well as some other friends and acquaintances. T + 1:30ish My visuals are kicking in now. I am looking at my computer screen, browsing around YouTube, and the search results are the first thing I see that get a little strange. So, they are stationary, and there is no movement, My perception was that the preview images were moving really subtly and slowly. It seemed almost like the images were stuck in a slow motion loop, even though they were not really moving. The rest of the screen seemed normal. It is also around this time that I noticed the blinds “breathing”, or a visual effect that a portion of them are moving while the majority is standing still. This is the first “real life” hallucination I saw other than just a digital one from looking at the computer screen. As I continued, I noticed that my room would light up with yellows and oranges, and I often had to either open or close the window because my body temperature was changing and I was not feeling comfortable.Somewhere after this, I had to use the rest room – it was the weirdest sensation ever as I felt like the toilet was starting to morph away into nothingness, and I was just trying to do my business. That is the moment when things turned from just visual to physical and it was pretty weird. During this time, I was also seeing the carpet in front of me have some swirling effects,  and there were dramatic shifts between light and dark and the colors they were bringing into the room. T + 1:45 – I think I was just laying around at this point enjoying things, while realizing how slowly time was moving. I sent a text to X and said “I really took this at 2 hours ago? This is terrifying and exhilarating.” In wanting to make sure I was safe while not making him feel like he had to keep track of me, I asked him to check in around 6, and he replied yes. In the next few hours is when things got uncomfortably weird. While enjoying the visuals, I realized that time was moving too slowly. I was sitting on my bed trying to stay engrossed in videos, and would get up to walk to the bathroom to get a drink of water, come back and repeat the process. The problem is I was looking at the time, and it was become 3:10. 3:12. 3:13. I can’t put words onto the visuals I was seeing, but the slowdown of time felt wrong. I remembered that I put an alarm on my iPod for 3:30 before I started, with a message that would come up to say “You’re OK”. I don’t know why I latched onto that time, but as soon as I did, things went even slower. I was not moving in slow motion, my brain was just moving super fast. I kept pressing the button to light up my iPod while all these thoughts were running through my head and I realized this thing would never be fucking finished.I took a video of myself during this time, and I was still pretty lucid. I watched through for a couple reasons – number one, I want to know what I was doing, and to try and get a deeper insight into my mind.As I recall, I was looking out my window at the rain falling, and saw the building across from me as some kind of barricade. And I felt like super strong and powerful, and kind of got lost in that idea, which led to me trying to write This is all I wrote, with the quoted text being me trying to clarify my thoughts at the time…~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A poetical attempt of capturing the fleeting moments of a thoughtA barricade. Strong and powerful. 'I don’t wanna get too lost up in this experience of the memory that I remember that the memory isn’t a real memory---and not gonna try to explain this right now either'What if this poem is my ticket to fame! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~So, I knew what I was seeing wasn’t really a barricade, I was just getting lost in the thought of it. Then I went to video…I seemed pretty normal, like I was drunk or high, but speaking normally, and I remember that things were still general positive at this point.I did notice that I felt like I was playing a part like I do with friends - I am the goofy, funny guy who is always on, and I didn't want to lose control of that...Which is something I fought against for the entire trip. I was afraid that if I let go, then I couldn’t be in control, and bad shit would happen – and that one thought led to me catastrophizing and spinning me off into a bad trip that seemed to last forever.T-4:00 So, it is like 4:30, and things are getting old. I feel like I am in this time loop where I keep walking to the bathroom to get a drink, and come back out to the bed (I guess that was happening after the videos because I seemed to be OK during those for the most part – I just didn’t want to keep trying to think things through and have pressure on myself) and I kept looking at my clock in between and wishing that time would go faster. I felt some kind of fear as I looked out my window and things were getting busy. Like a car would come in, and it had its lights on for some reason. And I started to get paranoid that they were looking up here. I started seeing the delivery drivers walk out and to their cars, but it seemed like it was the same guy in a loop. And I kept looking down at my clock and not understanding why things were moving so slowly and that something was really wrong. I saw there were a couple guys by the elevator in the building next door, and I thought that I might need some real help, so I got dressed, and went downstairs for a cigarette to see how I was feeling. It was raining and there was no cover, so I just stood there in pants and a tshirt getting rained on while the 2 guys were smoking and talking. I have no idea what they were talking about, but I know that I felt like they were staring at me whenever I looked away from them. The cigarette itself took forever to finish, and when I went back up only a couple minutes had passed. I was so fucked up and not realizing it, and I was out in public, but no one asked if I needed help, or talked to me while I was wandering. Another car came by, and I had total déjŕ vu, which makes sense – I have read déjŕ vu is your mind having registered something already, but that it did not process it correctly, so you think you know what is going to happen. During this the loop became worse, I would look down and see these two guys walking by, thinking that they were looking up at my room, and saw them walk by a ton, and in the grand scheme of things, really fucking slowly. Like, they were walking normally, and I would look away for what felt like enough time for them to leave, and I would look back and they were maybe a foot further than they were before. And again, I had the feeling of someone looking up at my window.At one point the cleaning woman was out there, talking with someone in the truck that had lights on and engine running, I swear it felt like it was hours. At this point, my mind was really fucking up perception, and I had a hard time realizing what was real and what wasn’t. I kept having the time 6 PM etched in my head cause I knew that was when X was going to check in.At some point I wrote to him and said, “Am I OK”, in a panic, and trying to have call him, And then realizing that I was (I wasn’t!). I wrote, I am OK at 5:22. And I got to the point where I was panicking, and trying to read online sites about what to do if you are having a bad trip, but it wasn’t making sense, I was going through what felt like walls of text in seconds, but I was understanding (at the moment) what I was reading. Shit gets twisted here, and my mind was again going a thousand miles a minute. Eventually, things went quiet outside, The rain stopped, the fan from the building below me stopped and the rain stopped. Everything was calm and peaceful. It was during those 20 minutes that I struggled with, and eventually accepted, that I was somehow dead. I had this 6 PM time in my mind, and it kept inching closer, and I just felt like everything I was thinking now is just a replay (like in a movie) and that I was going through the motions until I got to a place where 6 PM came and it would all stop and I would get pulled back into reality. And I was fighting back and forth between these thoughts of “If I am here, in my room, tripping balls, then I am fine” and “I must be blacked out somewhere on a street, and 6 PM is gonna come and I am gonna realize that something bad happened and I am actually in an ER somewhere being treated for an OD.” This also put me into a real panic to the point where I almost walked up to someone to ask for help and to call me an ambulance, but I had this thought in my head that if I got caught with drugs in my system, then my life would be over and it continued the panic cycle. I had this thought in my head that if I got caught with drugs in my system, then my life would be over and it continued the panic cycle. As I was sitting, It became 6, and everything was calming down. The trucks left, the rain was stopping. And I sat there, waiting for X, but I had catastrophized myself to this point so far, that I truly had thought “What if I am dead right now and this is just my soul. My soul is going to be here on this creation of earth and in order to move on I need to move up and better myself to get to the next place. What if I never existed, and all my experiences are just a part of this moment where I realize what life really is?” X messaged me a little later and said “You are fine”.And I wrote back to him – “yes, the trip is finally dying down” and he was super calm and comforting, to the point where I assigned him at that moment my “spirit guide” through this world. Words don’t really explain the experience – the bliss and happiness was amazing, the fears I had were paralyzing as I laid in bed trying to sort out these thoughts, and figure out how to move on with life now that I knew this, but I was still here on earth.So I went out and wanted to live life as best I could. I went out for a walk, and stopped by the coffee shop cause I thought I saw a man I knew working there. At this point my thoughts are still like, everything happening now is a sign, and all the people know what is happening with me right now, but to keep the standards of this world then I just keep things the same as they always were. So, like I cant talk about the trip to anyone, cause they won’t get it, and they will think I am nuts. But it wasn’t actually him, it was just someone who had a similar hair style and beard as him from a distance. He was a total old hippy, and I tried my best to have a conversation with him – because I never stop and talk to people. I just live my life, and let others live theirs, and I never actually stop to really look at myself or others. That night I did.That part is hard to explain – but I was truly believing that I had an experience that somehow opened me up to a fundamentally different world. At that point, I believed that the world, and everything in it, were created just for my soul as a way to move on to the next level of my soul's life. I still feared being ostracized from this world for doing something crazy, so I acted like things were normal, but I would still have thoughts that people were looking over at me and turning away as I looked up (which in reality they might have been since I obviously was still tripping).So, I just walked around and took in the downtown, and saw that all the construction that was completed was a sign of my own growth that I experienced today. That the homeless man walking down the street just had obstacles in his life and that he was doing what he could to get through them and better himself. I wasn’t seeing visuals anymore, it was like the trip just died down at 6 PM, and I was just on the come down so I was still feeling kinda weird and panicked while going through what I thought was my “new world”. I will say, that I walked around proud that night, and although I am lucky I didn’t get stopped by the police women I walked by, or get hit by a car at the intersections around me, and proud that I realized that the meaning of my life is to improve myself each day, even if it is in baby steps.T – 09:00 I am just trying to chill in my new reality, and I want to know if other people have experienced this stuff too so I was just popping around the internet watching some videos and reading about experiences. It is around this point that I really come down and the mental effects wear off, and I just start freaking out in bed about how loud I might have been earlier, who saw me fucked up, am I gonna get in trouble somehow, but none of that happened. I eventually was able to sleep at midnight for about 2 hours, then went back to bed at 2:30 till about 9 this morning.So my trip turned bad, and I don’t know exactly how or why. Obviously, I used too much for a first dose, and not having a sitter who I trusted with me, I freaked the fuck out. There were some good ideas I got from it which I need to try and bring into my life, but some that are horrible that I don't want to feel again.Exp Year: 2015ExpID: 107136Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 30 Published: Jul 19, 2020Views: 686    LSD (2) : Alone (16), Bad Trips (6), First Times (2) DOSE: T+ 0:002 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 1:001.5 gsmokedCannabis BODY WEIGHT:145 lbFrom last year around August, to the time of the incident (Feb?..) I was really into LSD. I had a very reliable supplier, it was always the real stuff. Never bought a hit or two at a time, usually would get a strip or two. Of course, not all for me. For the entire time period, I'd drop maybe once every two weeks. I'd do anywhere from 3-5. Greatly enjoying it, nothing bad ever happened. One night after work, I went to 'X''s house. I had gotten the strip of some 'Good micro dot'. I was a little worn out so I didnt want to do the normal amount. Keep in mind, I've dropped at least a few hundred times. So I decided to do 2, just to chill out and have fun and experience the experience ya know.So, I dropped 2 and he dropped 3 around 11 or so, the normal time I drop. I'm a night tripper, never been a fan of day tripping because every time I trip in public, I feel like everyones laughing at me for some reason. About an hour in, it started. Everything was going as it usually does with LSD. Slow melting movements, laughing historically, the normal. We decided to watch some DBZ  for a few hours. Smoke some bud, do the normal. But then things got... Dark.Fast.I disconnected from the tv show and just started exploring my mind. Then something happened. Ill never be able to explain this.. Please, from here on out keep your mind open to what happened, no matter how crazy I'm about to sound. This happened. From my perspective, none of this is fictional. This was all too real to me. And to X.It was around 1 or 2 a.m. The trip stopped. No come down, no falling asleep, it just. Stopped. The movement stopped. I felt sober. I felt like myself, I wasnt disoriented. We both looked at each other in complete confusion. What happened? We both asked that. I just went along with it and said 'Well that was a nice trip man, I'm gonna go to the restroom'. I go upstairs and like. The trip was just over. Just like that. I went back downstairs, and here begins the horror.I was sitting on the couch, and he said 'I have something to show you'. He plays an episode of DBZ. It began, and it glitched out kind of. The title screen said the episode was called 'Mistakes of last night'. I was utterly confused. I was utterly confused. He looked at me, as if he knew something I didn't know. The episode played, and full force, I was flung back into the trip. Like I've been punched with a psychedelic fist of intense power. The episode included a fight between Freeza and Goku.That night, I was being tested. Something else was with us. Something evil. Something communicating through the tv, DBZ, and controlling X. X wasn't himself. The whole time, I felt like he was in on it. Of course, the entity couldnt cause physical harm to me, so perhaps he used a host? This guy is about 2 or 3 hundred more pounds than me. He is a big guy. I got up to go get some water. I was nervous and very scared. He was in my way and asked where I was going. I didnt answer, and he looked like he was going to hit me so I put up my fists, kind of, just in case so I could defend myself.He swung at me, knocking me on my bed. Got on top of me and started to beat the fuck out of me. He got up and apologized, I apologized as well. I decided to stay down there with him. Then came the tests. In DBZ, Goku, represented life. Freeza, represented death.The clock read 4:00A.M.Every time I would make a mistake, Everything would replay. The episode would go backwards, me and him would both go in reverse. And the clock would reset to 4.I know I know, ridiculous. Just, keep hearing me out. Every time my will to live fell short, Freeza would get the upper hand on goku, and X would freak out and continue to hurt me. I was being tested. I was being punished. I let out all of my emotions and started crying, deeply. He got really emotional and I hugged him and he said it was okay, everything will be okay. Some blurry things happened, I dont recall it, but I had to endure ever bad feeling. The test was to endure it and prove that I had the will to survive. I threw up on his carpet, so I went to clean it up. Out of courtesy, I went to go to his laundry room (inside of his basement, where we were) to go wash it. I get in there, and he starts pounding the door. I rush to get it in there. The door slams open, and he's grabbing me pulling me back, punching me, my blood all over the wash dial for the washing machine. He threw me down and started to choke me with a pillow. I slowly slipped away, but I had to live. I had to prove to this entity that I wanted my life. In my mind, I could hear him mocking me. The entity. Telling me I'm unworthy of my life. I was suffocated, punched relentlessly, had the air sucked out of me, had intense pressure built up inside, I was about as close to death as you can get without dying. I was screaming 'He's trying to kill me, help'. At the top of my lungs, over and over. Finally I got up, broke his pipe that was in there to defend myself against him. Finally I slip free of his grip. I walked out into the basement room, lost all of my energy, and fainted. I then began to go into a seizure. Every part of my body shaking violently without control. I woke up in the ambulance. They told me if they hadn't gotten there sooner, I would have died from blood loss. They estimated that I had a good 15 minutes until I could have lost my life.  I was there. I was at the edge. I slipped away momentarily while being choked on the floor, reaching for something to grab, something to just help me get a breath of air.Some details that I left out because I'm not sure when it happened on the time line; I spilled a full cup of water on myself. The entity told me I had to go through complete embarrassment. I had to. To prove I could live. I got completely naked. Why ? For the above reason. The entity told me I had to be completely embarresed, to learn a lesson. More or less, I also did it so maybe he would stop trying to kill me. So he'd feel to disgusted to touch me. I cried and cried, yelling everything I regret in life.Anyways I havent touched LSD since. I never will. Ever.Thank you for reading.It was really hard typing this out...Exp Year: 2015ExpID: 106031Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 22 Published: Sep 22, 2020Views: 1,350    LSD (2) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Entities / Beings (37), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:001 capsloral4-HO-MET(capsule)  T+ 0:00300 ugsublingualLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:301 hitvaporized2-Fluorodeschloroketamine BODY WEIGHT:180 lb[Erowid Note: Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts.See this article on The Importance of Measured Doses.] I'll start this off with my previous experience with psychedelics. I have done Lsd, shrooms, hbwr seeds, and some light disso use. I've done lsd many times before and the highest dose I had ever done was 1200ug(closer to 1000 due to tabs likely being lighter and a little tolerance). I've done shrooms one time at around 4-5 grams and that was very difficult but thats a story for another time. Hbwr was nothing notable and my disso use was very limited. This was my first experience with 4-ho-met.My plan when going into this trip was to take the lsd and the 4-ho-met at the same time, and before I started to peak was planning on vaping some deschloroketamine(I found out later that this was 2-fdck so I would have felt little to no effects). I had no real deep purpose going into this trip besides wanting to have a crazy trip. I had a problem with my scale however. Anytime I would put the powder onto the scale the reading would go crazy and not have even a somewhat accurate reading. I so f**k it and fill a size 00e capsule a little less than a quarter of the way full. I hadn't the slightest clue of how much I took at the time. I got a new scale after this trip and I'm guessing the dose was at least 50-60 mg but that is a conservative estimate. THE TRIP!9:45 - I ingest the pill and I put the tab under my tongue. I started my stopwatch and take a shower.10:15 - I come back to my room and realize how messy it is. I hate tripping with a messy room because it messes with my vibe so I start to pick things up and put them out of sight till my floor seems appealing. I'm starting to become more and more confused. I pick up my vape with the "dck" in it and I take one hit and try to take another. I didn't have it in me to take another because of how intense the headspace was getting. I set my vape down and lay down. I'm sweating, cold, and feel nauseous. I'm starting to see the most intricate and intense visuals I've ever seen in my life.There are no more time stamps because the time dilation was so pronounced and I'm sure I couldn't read it if I tried.I'm laying down and starting to really really feel it. I felt similar to how I did on mushrooms by playing with my hands and reaching my arm in the air for minutes at a time. I'm trying to tell myself that I'm fine. I'm laughing and I'm doing all I can to keep the trip light. I was trying to submit but I didn't even know how to do that. This next part of my trip gave me chills 24 hours later when I remembered it. I had red led's in my room and I felt like a being was digging into my brain. Not physically, but how psychedelics can drill into the inner self. I'm seeing what can only be described as some sort of psychedelic carnival. It was very bright and colorful and again intricate. My mind starts to focus on a girl. She is drawn in black and white in contrast to the sea of visuals. She is curled up in a ball shaking and I sense that she was on mushrooms. My mind felt like it was circling around her and I see her face. And it was a horrific smile. One that you would see in a bad horror movie. The smile was drawn on her as well but it was stretching past her face. I had this strong feeling that I was the girl at the end of the visual. This ended and I tried my hardest to turn the red LEDs off. I eventually did after fiddling with it for a little.I face my ceiling with the intention of riding it out like most of my trips. My walls in my peripheral vision start to fade away and so do the colors for a brief while. I was stuck in some place I never want to go back to, there was nothing and I was nothing. I felt alone and scared, I was panicking hard and somehow came back to my body in my room. I was then tossing and turning for what felt like hours upon hours. I felt like the trip would never end and I would be tripping in public the next day. I start to feel more associated with my ego and realize I had to use the bathroom. My visuals are still going strong but I can still see. I was in the bathroom as quick as I possibly could have been in there. I come back to my room feeling fatigued as hell. I look at my stopwatch and only an hour and 45 minutes had passed since I took everything. My heart sank and I felt like it was just about to start again and I started to anticipate another wave of terror. But it never came. I was just scrolling through my phone happy as ever. I fell asleep from the fatigue in about an hour and woke up feeling almost normal.I was very confused about the acid because I knew for a fact I didn't have bunk tabs. And I fell asleep after maybe 3 hours. It was very weird but I chalked it up to the fatigue from the 4-ho. Moral of the story is I shouldn't ever eyeball drugs. Especially super potent psychedelics.Exp Year: 2020ExpID: 114883Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 16 Published: Oct 19, 2020Views: 1,518    4-HO-MET (436), LSD (2), OBE (332) : Combinations (3), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Hangover / Days After (46), Alone (16) DOSE:2 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:225 lbI find it hard to write about what has happened to me in the short course of about five months but I know talking about it helps so maybe writing about it will also help.After my first bad trip I should have known not to trip again but I suppose the agony of my current delusional and panic stricken state is the price I pay for being fooled twice.  My first bad experience occurred in September 2007.  I was coming home from my girlfriend's dorm up at her college writing a book about 'the perfect state' of the universe and how everything happened for a reason.  I was in a philisophical mode so I decided it would be a good idea to take some strong acid that night.  Granted I had had experience with mushrooms on many occasions and was an avid smoker of marijuana but I had only tried 'bunk' acid before and the only overwhelmingly strong trip I had previously was when I broke through on Salvia.The trip started pretty nicely, as I heard most bad trips do.  I was listening to music on my girlfriend's Ipod and felt pretty incredible.  I am pretty sure I sat up at one point and said to my friends 'Guys this is incredible!'  But slowly I started having a flashback to my experience with salvia.  I felt as if somehow, the two trips were related.  All of my friends started to change around me and I felt as if they were demons.It was as if I was stuck in limbo.  My one female friend seemed to embody my mother, the dark side of my yin and yang, my nurturer, and my other friend was the white side, active, impatient, exuberant.  They each seemed to posses their own way of wanting to have me die in the long run.  On was anxious and willing for me to run into death, the other wanted to lull me into death.  Eventually they calmed me down and I was able to chain smoke myself to sleep.I got over that trip well enough.  In between this trip and the real meat of this essay I had a mushroom trip, my first bad one, in which I felt I was being lead to hell and I had to find heaven.  Not so good of a trip but I also got over that one.  Did I stop?  Of course not.My final trip is of the LSD variety.  Once again it started wonderfully.  I was watching an episode of Oprah that was on at midnight for some reason.  Jerry Seinfeld's wife was on the show and sharing cooking recipes.  She looked beautiful to me.  Angelic almost.  I looked at her and thought to myself that she would never hurt me.  Hurt me?  Why was I thinking about things trying to hurt me?  My two male friends C and K were absent from the room when I was coming up (good friends right?) and I was losing myself in myself gradually.  They came back a while later only to freak me out of my mind.  C kept asking me questions about how I thought sound worked as he patted on a speaker.  I could have sworn I heard sounds start to come out as he patter. K just looked weird to me but often said things that made me feel comfortable.  C was the one that really personified the devil for me that night.  But at the same time K looked so godawful to me.  As the night waned on through eternity I could not decide what I should do.  I ran out of there house.  I ran up and down the street seeking heaven.  Eventually people started coming out of their homes to go to work but I thought it was all the work of the demons to make me feel rediculous in my pursuit of heaven.  I eventually mustered up the courage to walk past a house with a cackling witch on it (Halloween decorations were up) and a man with a dog came out of his house.  As I passed them I walked into the brightest light I have ever walked into in my life.  I felt as if I had died, but it was beautiful.  Everything made sense to me.  I could feel beautiful and free.  However my human side must have gotten scared for suddenly I was facing the other way again and looking at K.  He assured me I was ok and said he was scared for me.They eventually took me home where I sat up for a day feeling as though I was rotting like an onion (I hadn't bathed in almost four days and felt as if I was crumbling from the outside to my core).  it was interesting enough that I saw two different cooking shows involving the peeling of onions while I sat in my house vibrating in fear.  I tried to watch cartoons to calm myself down, I tried to watch news, anything familiar and calm, everything seemed to be sending me messages. I ended up stayin up for a total of 96 hours.  By the day after I got home my mom and grandmom decided to take me to a hospital.  I could absolutely not sleep in the hospital and was given nothing along the lines of thorzine (possibly to my benefit).  From the hospital I went to a rehab so I could stop doing all the drugs I had been doing previous to these bad trips.  I finally got to shower and think I eventuall got to sleep.Even though I feel I get somewhat rested to this day I still wonder if I am actually even sleeping at all.  I have paranoid delusions and see a therapist weekly.  I have been put on risperdal and a slow release form of it to take in the mornings named invega.  I pray this has all been a bad dream that I can still wake up from.  I hope I am on no perma trip into eternity.  I feel as if I am getting better daily but still try to keep myself inside a lot.  I feel as though for now it is a punishment that fits the crime.  I tried to get outside of myself for too long and almost fully ate that proverbial 'forbidden fruit' and felt god in full.  I hope something saved me and brought me back here and will eventually fully restore me.  Panic attacks are one thing to be dealt with but the mentality that everything is a plot to destroy or maintain you eternally is a whole nother thing.  I pray I am not choosing heaven or hell right now in writing this and if I am choosing one I hope it is heaven, even just metaphorically speaking.  I thank experience reports for insight into other people's experiences who have had similar awakenings and eventually recovered.   Out of all this I am sure I will become a better man for certain.  I have stopped using drugs, I go to NA when I am not too distraught, I have already quit cigarettes, and am currently in the process of finding who I need to be to make god proud.  I was formerly a strict daoist but now I am leaning towards catholicism.  I know it can be a bit strict but I need someone/something to be there as my saviour sometimes and who better than Christ and what better tool than his love?   LSD has taught me a lot but it has also left me somewhat empty.   I hope to restore that space.  LSD is not something to be toyed with.

Do forgive me if I write in an odd manner or just spell stuff wrongly, I'm a Swede after all.It was at this party, in a clearing in the middle of the forest, I took my first doses of both drugs in my life (I'll come to this later, as I wouldn't recommend doing this). This clearing was also at the top of a hill, so that the forest went downwards in every direction from the party. With a lake after about 100 meters in one direction.I was there with 3 friends, one whom I knew really well, the other two I had just met. I was very careful picking this moment, as it felt safe to be with people who were (very) experienced with trips of this kind. I had also prepared mentally for this, reading up a lot about the drugs and their effects, and also got some advice from my friends (with how to handle certain scenarios, like 'bad feelings') which I think was of tremendous help looking back at things.A short summary would be something like this: The LSD trip (from 07pm to 04am) was a very pleasant and calm experience which I experienced very 'solo', i.e. I had little social interaction during this period. The mushroom trip afterwards (from roughly 4am to 10am) was much more extreme, and even though it started out nicely and I liked it very much, it turned around on me and hit me like a truck and turned into a very scary experience.To me, it felt like the LSD trip was controllable and that I could 'steer' it, and that the mushroom trip was the opposite, which scared me. We scored some LSD at the party and 3 out of 4 of us took 1....piece or whatever you call it. One piece of paper. One dose. The fourth, one of the other's girlfriend, didn't take any and reassured me that she would take care of us (mostly me) and this helped a lot as I was a little nervous to say the least. For the first 30 minutes - 1 hour I didn't feel anything at all and was constantly asking questions to my friends, probably driving them mad in the process. I was worried that I had bought too little and that it wouldn't affect me due to me being quite tall and big etc. They just kept saying that I definately shouldnt buy more and just wait and see. After a while the agreed that if nothing had happened after two-three hours I could buy more cause in that case I could've been unlucky and gotten a bad dose.We were sitting on a blanket and I was talking to my friends when I suddenly got the urge to stand up and walk around a little. So I stood up and felt a bit...weird...and looked around at all the people also sitting in the clearing. I was wearing a hoodie and pulled it up and started to walk around. It was starting to get darker, so it was kinda in the twilight. After a while I noticed (note. everything I noticed/thought/experienced wasn't necessarily true, but it was how I perceived things at the moment) that people were looking at me in an odd manner from their places. I started to find it very funny that they were looking at me, and talked to myself in a mumbling manner about them looking at me. I noticed that I was starting to have troubles speaking normally, and I would only whisper and act (probably very) strange to people, whispering back and snickering at what they said to me if they approached me. I was starting to feel very happy, and I was starting to enjoy nature much more than before. As things got darker, I hid more and more inside my hoodie, walking around slowly or even sneaking among people, watching them and thinking they were really funny without managing to pinpoint WHY exactly. I was aware that I was tripping, but I didn't worry much about it and just rode it out. 2 hours after eating the dose the 4th (sober) friend asked if she could have my wine. I was still somewhat clear headed but still noticed I started tripping balls so I figured I wouldnt need the wine, so I said sure and asked her to lead me to the tent which was about 200 meters from the clearing, past some parked cars in a very secluded area of the forest, as I thought it probably would be nice with a calmer environment. When we arrived I, for the first time since I started tripping, noticed one of my friends again. For about 1 hour I had forgotten all about my friends basically. He was tripping in a bad way and was hiding in his tent for reasons unknown. For the first time I realized that they were tripping too and actually pitied the guy because he had a bad trip, but it didnt scare me, which I thought it would've.I was waiting 10 meters away from the tent and it was almost pitch dark now, when things started going crazy. All of sudden I saw 4 figures standing in the woods about 10 meters from the path that lead to the tents. I might add that before I took the drug, I had promised myself to try to have an open and positive mind to everything I experienced. I think this helped me greatly on this first trip, as I greeted the figures and realized they were guardians of the forest, overlooking us people partying. I was not afraid at all, and talked into the forest at these shapes (of shadow, probably).The sober girl came back and noticed me talking and asked what I saw and was very calm and listened carefully to my story. She was great help overall with her serene ways and I highly recommend someone like her accompanying you on your first trip.As we walked back to the party things got even stronger, and I started losing my ability to talk more and more. I was replying with hmms, and mmms, and nods and shakes and usually needed to concentrate much to even whisper stuff to people. For a moment and tried very very hard and managed to speak normally for about 20 seconds to my friend, to test it, but it was pretty tough to do so I used those seconds to explain why I didnt talk, and she said it was cool and that I could just nod and use sign language if I had to tell her something.Back at the party I suddenly noticed all of the torches and the big fireplace that was burning VERY brightly in the dark. I figured that something like this would happen and it was very awesome to watch the big fire crackle and burn. For about 1-3 hours from now on I was only walking around between people, thinking everyone was sober but me, keeping to myself for most of the time, mumbling stuff to myself and now and then I would wander into the pitch dark, where I saw small shapes walk around in the woods. Or I so I believed I saw. I wasnt 100 sure I saw them, I might add. I was somewhat scared of them and usually just ventured into the woods when I had to pee from then on, always talking with them and saying I were their friend when I met them again. To make sure they wouldnt attack me. I guess I thought they were some kind of forest nymphs or elves.After this period I sat down at the fireplace and noticed that I could speak somewhat decently again. Though I mostly sat silently watching the fire for the next hour anyway, and only spoke when spoken to, keeping conversations very short, but always smiled so that people wouldn't be offended. I was very self-aware at this point, and noticed that people watched me tripping, or at least thought I did. (Later on I heard that many beside me were tripping madly too, but it is supposedly very common that you dont notice other people tripping when you trip yourself)I now noticed my closest friend, who I hadnt spoken to since I started tripping. He was watching me intensly and this was the first time I noticed that someone else was high than me. He was grinning at me BROADLY and I found this so hilarious that I had to hide lying behind people and just laugh out loud, which made him do the same thing. But we never approached each other or talked. I then lay over on my back and noticed the STARS and treetops. The trees were shimmering and the stars were moving very very fast but only in very very short distances from their original positions. I guess you could call it 'shaking'. Since it was a clearing, I saw the trees from both sides of the clearing, and faint arches of light were created. I was now in conversation with a girl who had taken mushrooms, and we compared our experiences. It was around 1-2am I guess and I was starting to come down. In Sweden the sun comes up VERY early this time a year, so it was maybe only 1-2 hours left of darkness, and I guess some light was already sipping in because when I went to pee in the darkness I saw LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS of white flowers shining in the otherwise pitch dark. Im guessing that my eyes were so dilated that I could see the faintest amount of light reflected off these white flowers rather easily.From now on I was just in a nice mood, talking with people again, having a good time, but still having some enhanced vision mainly. My friends were also doing this, and my closest friend was asking around for mushrooms. He eventually got some and ate a normal dose, I forgot how much. I think it was  like a handful. I can't remember what kind it was but I recall it having some kind of connection with South America, perhaps Mexican? I'm no drug expert, by far.Anyway, he was chatting away with people and I was just reflecting my experiences for another hour or two, having a good time with people.At around 4am I decided I wanted some mushrooms as well, I was feeling very bold at the moment. I wouldn't recommend this, looking back.He managed to get me half a dose, which was half a handful, and apparently it was 'mixed' kinds of shrooms. I chewed them for about 1-2 minutes before swallowing, and was not worried. I didnt even ask alot about the effects. I was probably still high as fuck as my friend said my eyes were dilated to the max, but as the heaviest experience from LSD was behind me I thought I was totally not high anymore. Boy was I wrong.Anyway, after about 30 mins I walked up and danced a little on the leafy 'dance floor'. Then it happened. I was suddenly seeing every leaf, and every 'pine needle' or whatever they are called, on the forest floor. In a way I was seeing EVERY OUTLINE of EVERY ITEM in the forest very very clearly. It was like a massive  information overload coming into my eyes. The filter that filters out unneccesary stuff in your vision...well it wasnt active anymore. I was seeing everything. Everything. At the same time.A while later colours were starting to become much more saturated and bright. And the leaves and ground started to move very slightly. I wasnt sure at first if this was REALLY true or if I was just wishing it was true, but I got it confirmed later, very much so.After a while the ground and leaves and needles started to move in very very complicated but somehow logical patterns. What was very cool was that they MOVED to the music. And in a way it was like watching one of those effect things in winamp or some other music program, a visualizer or whatever they are called. The patterns pulsed and moved sharply, with every base BOOM, and danced around the floor. Only when I focused BEHIND the forest floor I saw reality again, and I played with this for a while.I this awesome experience of colours and patterns I felt euphoric  and smiled largely at everyone. Talking nicely and dancing. I decided to walk away a little in this happiness, along the path towards the cars again. The forest was so green that it almost hurt my eyes watching at it. And as I walked down the path I noticed that....my vision was very fucked up. For a while it was like walking on a treadmill, I was seeing the same portion of the path over and over as I walked, and sometimes it SKIPPED quickly to the right, and sometimes I saw two paths. It was moving and it made me dizzy. I decided I should go back to the party and just sit down and relax for a while when the BAD THING happened.Probably to due walking around so much and not drinking enough water all night my lower leg seizured/cramped. It felt like I got 100 needles stuck in my leg and I wasnt able to walk. This triggered a sense of panic as I was alone, stuck on the path, and closest person was 200 m away from me. Even though I was in no risk of dying at all I felt very afraid and thought I was going to die on the path, I really did. I shouted some and a couple of people coming from the cars helped me back to the party where I sat down and drank a lot of water (as they recommended). But I couldn't fight the anxiety even though I sat still, and luckily enough my closest friend who was also tripping but not like me agreed to go back to the tent to help me ride out the bad trip.Back at the tent we decided to get some sleep and just rest, but there was no room for us in the tent as it was occupied, so he got out a red/green/orange blanket and put it out on the floor. For a moment I forgot my fear laughed at the irony of bringing such a brightly coloured blanket to an occasion like this, as it was VERY VERY COLOURFUL  and had a very complicated pattern to begin with. I just went 'GAHHH, I CANT WATCH IT HAHA, NICE BLANKET FOR A TRIP DUDE' and he replied 'HAHA WELL, I DIDNT REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT, SORRY'. But my fear/anxiety stayed with me and I was lying on the blanket with my friend asking 10000000000 questions about everything related to the bad trip. If it was going to kill me, etc. He was at the same time having an awesome trip, and just replied in a positive manner to everything I said. Somehow it calmed me when I was talking, and I got more anxious when I was silent. So I kept talking for the whole duration of the bad trip, probably for at least an hour. I remember that it was very painful as I couldn't escape the effects in any way. If I was watching, I saw a SHINY GREEN FOREST with lots of mosquitos who each and everyone had a trail of light following them in the air. I saw every outline and every item still, and it was very colourful, and I hated it and felt so much regret for taking the mushrooms just after coming down on LSD. SILLY SILLY ME i kept repeating, what was I thinking? At its peak I almost phoned my family but my friend talked me out of it (luckily, HAHA). After a while the anxiety finally wore off and I felt very relieved, even though the colours were still there and the outlines and detail too. You could say it was like if you took a picture of a forest, and outlined every thing in the picture with a black border, and increased color saturation so it became super colorful. That's how I percieved things. So we were walking around and talking and were being really meta-physical in our conversations, talking about what is real and what is real, and that what we perceive as real normally actually isnt more REAL than this. And it felt very clear to me. Suddenly I felt I understand every weird junkie I had talked with in my life. Haha. After a while we drove home and that was the end of it. Very special experience.Oh one think I might add, I was throughout both trips experiencing what my friend called 'endorfintugg' or 'endorphin chewing' in english? + spelling. It was like a tics that made me cramp my jaw and sent tingling sensations from my jaw, down my neck and spine each time. My friend said it was because my body was releasing so much endorphines. I'm not sure what it was but all I can say was that I kept having these  sensations for 1-3 days after the trip.That's about it. My fingers are exhausted from typing now so I'll stop.Exp Year: 2009ExpID: 82500Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 24 Published: Jan 8, 2021Views: 734    Mushrooms (39), LSD (2) : Festival / Lg.

I'm sure that I'm going to leave a lot of stuff out, but this is what I can remember about the WORST trip of my life. Some of my college friends had come down to chill with me for a few days during Christmas break. They brought some doses called 'jurrassic park' that had little pictures of dinosaurs on them. The friend who had supplied the hits said they were awesome, and the rest of us took him at his word. I had no idea what I was getting myself into.We had about half a sheet of this shit, and me being the experienced acid veteran that I was, decided to pop 4. My other friends took 2 each, and we decided to walk to the park to chill and wait for the acid to take effect. We had brought along some good weed, and a fifth of jack to help pass the time (lol) while waiting. It was around 6pm when we made it to the park. Well, we toked up and did a number on our bottle, and no one was really talking about the acid yet. I was starting to get pissed as it was now 7pm, I had taken 4 hits and felt nothing. I got up to take a piss behind a tree and then it hit me. It was fucking intense. We were in the woods and suddenly everything started flashing like a strobe light had been turned on. Somehow I found my friends at a picnic table under a little pavilion in the center of the park and was like 'shit dude...you guys feel it yet?' They confirmed that they were too frying balls now (8pm now). This is where it starts getting freaky. I was into a lot of the cheesy 80's horror movies at the time, and we were in the woods. So I started seeing Jason from Friday the 13th running around in the trees with a machete.I kept trying to warn my friends that we needed to get the hell out of here, but they'd just hand me a bowl and tell me to chill. The flashing strobe light effects were getting stronger and stronger, and I was having tunnel vision. After they convinced me that Jason wasn't really in the woods and reminded me I was on a shit load of acid, I decided to try to chill. After they convinced me that Jason wasn't really in the woods and reminded me I was on a shit load of acid, I decided to try to chill. I packed another bowl and smoked it to myself. Then I polished off the jack and decided to lay back on the bench of the picnic table to help me relax. It worked and I was like cool.I laughed with everyone about how freaked I got over thinking Jason was gonna kill us and shit, and everything seemed like it was going to be all right. It was now about 12am btw. The flashing lights, however weren't subsiding at all. They were growing and growing with more intensity. It was cool as hell because I like strobes. But it was kinda scary too because I knew we were in the middle of the fucking woods and there couldn't possibly really be lights doing that.At this point we decided it would be cool to relocate to my house. I was like 'just let me finish this cigarette'. I finished and attempted to sit up. Holy Shit! it hurt. I mean it really fucking hurt! My back felt like someone stabbed me or something. I totally couldn't sit up, or even move my legs. It sucked because my friends didn't know what to do to help. They just sat with me and talked to me trying to 'talk me down' I imagine. But I wasn't tweaking out. I couldn't fucking move!I was literally paralyzed for about 2 hours. But it felt like an eternity and hurt like hell. That acid kicked my ass, and I read somewhere that the strobe patterns I was seeing all night was probably my central nervous system shutting down. Scary shit dude.Exp Year: 1996ExpID: 12152Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Jan 15, 2021Views: 890    Alcohol - Hard (198), Cannabis (1), LSD (2) : Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3), General (1), Health Problems (27), Nature / Outdoors (23), Public Space (Museum, Park, etc) (53) DOSE:2 tablets LSD(blotter / tab)   smokedCannabis(plant material)BODY WEIGHT:160 lbIt was the summer of 96 in Calgary AB.  I had a group of friends I often tripped with, and there were a few girls my friends were trying to pick up.Evrything started off like a typical trip: at randy's apartment wich was a lsd friendly place;good music good visuals good vibes.Like most trips I have to go outside and explore, so we went to princes island park, a fun place to be stoned.We smoked a few fattys at the top of the hill you go down to get to the park.  Funny how much smoke fits in my lungs on acid.    There was a great view of the city skyline at dusk.  I noticed I was kinda being excluded so I tried to get in the conversation.  This girl mandy was tripping out on how everything looked square, I tried to tell her yes, but all the light are round.  She was like ooookkk.  This didn't bother me too much.So we started down the never ending staircase down the hill, about halfway down I saw mandy sitting on a bench with her eyes closed, about a foot away from her head was the biggest pure black spider I ever saw in my life, it was really really big.  So I asked mandy if she had her eyes closed because of that spider?  Mandy got all weirded out and was all like what spider your trying to fuck me up, my buddy jason who was rather sketchy said he saw the spider too, mandy freaked out and ran away from me.  I thought that was kinda fucked up.Then my mind started spinning a bad way, and I thought that spider was the devil, and if I told anyone I would die.But I had to tell my best friend dave.  When I tried to tell him my delicate situation our companion jud,(this guy was raised in a hardcore christian home but now he is crazy, like he thinks he's jesus crazy)anyway jud is all like what you have to say? Want me to write it down? Pulls out a pad of paper and a pen.  I'm all like ahhhh what to do... So I just walked away, feeling distant from the group again.I was sitting alone on the grass watching the rookie girls make fools of themselves.  They were all talking random shit and laughing very annoyingly, doing cartwheels and gymnastics.  I musta been feeling kinda down at this point, getting all self conscious n stuff.  Thats when dave showd up and showed me how fun running over the rolling hills can be.So now I'm running around, I knew I was close to the river, could hear it but not see it.  When I suddenly saw a porthole to another dimention-It looked like a pure black rectangular door and there where ripplpes being radiated from the edges.  I stood in awe a thousand acid thoughts went thru my head, should I go thru? Where does it go? What the fuck?Then my eyes focused and I was standing no more then two feet from the river.I sometimes feel like I did enter a parallel universe that night.  For one acid was never fun anymore for me, and my friendships with my two best friends began to decay, and I went thru the worst time in my life.Exp Year: 1996ExpID: 32380Gender: Male Age at time of experience: Not Given Published: Mar 5, 2021Views: 672    LSD (2) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:Repeated hitssmokedCannabis(flowers) Several hitsoralLSD(liquid)BODY WEIGHT:165 lbIt all started around 5:45 P.M.  I drove to this house, intending to just get really stoned.  My friend, call him A., said I should come over and chill out for the night.  A teacher had taken two exchange students, S. and R., and we went to their house.  She had a place for them to stay and never went in there.  I did not know S. and R. very well, but they seemed cool.  When I arrived, S. was there by himself, and we rolled a fat blunt an smoked it.  Then A. got there and we smoked some more.  I was feeling great.  At about 6:15, I don't really know but all of this seems right, A. took out a vile of acid. He had already taken a few hits and offered me some for free.  I was broke but he said it was all good, so he poured some on the lid of an altoids can. I ate it and everything was going good and we left to go rent The Wizard of Oz.  We returned and started to watch it and everything went fucking intense.  I told A. and S. that I could not listen to Floyd and watch that movie, that I was losing my shit and we turned it off.  My arms were numb, and huge surges of energy were pulsing through them.  I had a cup from Whataburger, and it broke because I was shaking it saying over and over, 'this shit is intense!!' By 8:00 or so I snapped out of a daze and R. was there and he had some weird trance music playing.  I just sat there with mind blowing thoughts racing through my head, and constant waves of numbness where I couldn't hear or speak or do anything.  I started freaking out and saying let me go to my car.  They would not let me but I was sure that if I got to my car, I would chill out. I didn't want to drive, I was just freaked out by people and the music.  I paced back and forth, and finally asked S. if I could lay on his bed.  He said sure and from that point on it seems like a dream.  The end... not really.  That is the boring part.  It seems so much like a dream, but I remember every detail like it was yesterday.  I jumped out of S.'s bed, and started screaming.  'JESUS CHRIST!!, JESUS CHRIST!!'  I thought I was going to die.  This is about 9:00 pm.  They tried to calm me down, but I would not trust them. I thought they were Satan trying to take me to hell.  All of their attempts to make me sane again had failed.  There was no way I was going to hell, so I had to repent before I died.  I would look up at them as if to stop, and they would tell me it was alright.  Thoughts crossed through my head that it would be better to go with the devils, but I thought that they were tricking me. Thoughts crossed through my head that it would be better to go with the devils, but I thought that they were tricking me.  I screamed and yelled and the teacher called the paramedics.  I jumped off the floor and ran out the door and hit R. as I tried to beak through their grasp.  R. got his baseball bat and hit me with it and then it was a struggle with the cops.  A. said that it took 3 cops to put me on the stretcher into restraints.  And then I went to the emergency room.  I remember when I first got into the hospital, I completely calmed down.  I thought it was all over and I was fixing to go to heaven.  The air was cool, there were men in white clothes walking around me, but then I saw the police and tried to get up and realized I was in restraints.  I freaked the fuck out.  I began to thrash and cus and yell. Then they put me under.  All I remember about that was a dream, where I went through the 9 stages of life.  I don't know how many there are but I know that in my  mind there was nine.  I then went through birth, and death over and over and over. And every time I was at birth, I just remember a dark tunnel that I had to push through.  After thinking the tunnel was me struggling in restraints for hours and trying to break them.  When I woke up at 6:30A, Sunday, I had stopped thrashing for quite sometime. But I couldn't move without being in a lot of pain and every breath I took felt like I was just recovering from getting the wind knocked out of me.  My lab report showed positive for marijuana, and everything else was clean so the doctors were stunned.  They thought I had a seizure but I told my parents what I did when I got home.  They didn't flip out that much and I drove to school the next day and partied that weekend.

This experience made me lose my mind and enter a world of torment unlike my wildest imaginations. I have read many bad trip reports, ones that blew my mind with how awful they sounded, not one of them prepared me for this. Nothing could. This felt like CIA mind control torture,  this felt like a rite of passage to become a warrior. This was unreal and I need to share what it was. We dropped acid at a bar and I had a decent come up. We drove home, tripped balls, smoked a joint. It was fine. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] The only time I was that uncomfortable was when there was this baby around crying. As you can imagine that freaked me out, but I was fine. I was coming down, I had dropped at 2:08 and it was 630 or so now, and one of my friends gets out a dab rig. I made the mistake of taking a huge ass rip. I remember coughing so much I almost threw up, collapsing to the floor, and taking my shirt off. My friend was looking at me hysterically, "I need to get how he's feeling" my other friend said "are we just gonna get fucked up tonight? I think that's what we're doing". I just said "no man, you don't want to feel like this". I then lost consciousness. What happened next will always be impossible to describe. I was in a dark dense singularity, with no memory of anything. Time was not real here, it was eternity. There was no time. This first entrance into this realm was likely my soul's opportunity to determine whether this realm was nirvana or its inverse. My soul decided that it was its inverse, as panic, endless and eternal fear and dread, gripped me tight. My thoughts were incredibly brief and scattered here, but among them were confused, momentary considerations of how long I had been here, was this eternity,  was I a soul damned to endless torment, and the main thought that predominates was simply "this isn't right. This isn't normal". I felt like this should only have been temporary, and that this should have ended by now.  However this is an odd thing, because I did not know what normal was. My ego was struggling to resist its dissolution,  but this had already happened, and the result was this panic. I knew at one point I thought that this was just how some energies exist, as pure pain, and that I was one with this energy, and my purpose in this psychic whirlwind was to experience this pain eternally, as my fate, the concept of hell made sense, but I can't remember if the idea of hell came to mind. I think I developed that perception of it afterwards. While it was happening,  I was tormented, I was one with the universal energy of chaos. The sounds I heard were odd and scattered, distant screaming, running footsteps sprinting, shouting and it all seemed to travel inward on itself, like a black hole. occasionally human speech I could barely make out saying things like are you okay man"? I knew these were what I needed to return to, but I had no idea what they were or why I needed to be drawn to them. Time shattered and bits of it landed everywhere,  and the visions I saw were reflections my mind saw on the pieces I had lost. The sights I saw were mainly restricted to visions of constant crushing, pulsing and imploding nothingness. I could hear it's negativity, and it was all I had ever known. I knew I could not escape this torment, but the more visions of worldly things flashed in and out of my mind, the more I understood I had something to return to. I did not know what. I would see my two friends sitting there randomly. It seems this vision would flash into my view without meaning or context several times over the course of this ego death. Was I one of them? Were they there to help me? These visions should have helped me but it took a long time. They just fucking terrified me, I did not know if I was one of them, if they knew me, or even what they were. It seemed like them sitting there was the first thing I had ever laid eyes on. It was truly bizarre to see my two friends in this disturbed context. Eventually my vision began to show me myself in this room, crying, unable to control myself. Somewhere along the line I muttered something to my friends along the lines of "guys, I dont know where I've been, heaven or hell, but I have experienced hell tonight". They obviously were tripping and had no fucking clue what to do, this was the worst trip either of them have ever seen. At one point when I was trying to break through I found that I couldn't even count properly. I would just find myself in this void, desperate, repeating the same number over and over because I could not tell if I had already said it. My friend began counting properly, and it amazed me. I had no idea who it was that was speaking,  but it sounded like the voice of God giving the concept of time to an unevolved primate for the very first time. It was incredible.  Shortly after I broke back through, I was basically acting like an infant that had just breached the womb. I was exactly that, I had returned to my conscious mind and body after an eternity of hell. I remember seeing myself wondering "who is this guy? He fucked up with some drugs, huh." I screamed at my friends about how far I could fucking push it, about how humiliated I was, how embarrassed I was, how I was in hell and they didn't get it. I barely remember this, but I was acting out of my mind. I was. I was insane. My friend's mom gave me milk to calm me down (funny as hell) and it did kind of help. She was so nice to me, I am extremely grateful for her. The following hour or so after my consciousness was restored were awful, I was an inconsolable wreck of a person who just cried and rambled about how miserable and terrible it was. My brain was fixated on it. Eventually my girlfriend came to pick me up and take me home. I had apparently suffered a seizure-like fit, fallen and hit my head, and in this process destroyed my friends sliding closet door, made of glass. I had felt terrible about what happened, but the immediacy of my trauma made it impossible to gain composure, and I was just a miserable annoying wreck until I got picked up. The next day I came over and we had a long talk as I helped clean up and replace the door. His evaluation was that I might be slightly schizo. I have no idea, but based on his evaluation and my fit, I have to assume that there is something about my brain at this point in my life that was truly unable to cope with this.The following two days I lived in fear and emotional instability,  unable to grasp the nature of this experience,  swearing myself to sobriety.  I had wanted so desperately to be free from that place that I vowed never to go there again. As I write this, I find myself regretting that dab so much. I want to enjoy acid again. For the sake of those who love me and my own health, I have to be sober now. That was too much. It scarred and debilitated me. It was the limit of what my brain is capable of doing and experiencing,  sensory wise. I witnessed the breaking down of all the processes my brain uses to form this reality, literally all of them. Sight, sound, reasoning, touch, all fell away and into each other, all stimulus was rushed into my brain and crushed into itself like an endless dense void. I need my brain to work normally for a while, I need my senses to be aligned. 2 weeks later I was feeling a little bit more stable, and decided to get super high on sunday (I know, the whole sobriety thing didnt last long). The first joint in the afternoon felt incredible, but the second one before bed awakened probably the only acid "flashback" I've ever had, but really it was more of a PTSD flashback - I was still lucid but suddenly a terrifying wave of dissociative horror and overwhelming tingling and burning sensations gripped my body and mind. I was with my girlfriend and it scared the shit out of her, I was shaking and writhing in bed constantly repeating "I need to stay grounded" and "oh fuck this is bad". This experience ruined me possibly just as bad as the original trip, as I still have trouble sleeping alone, the floating feeling and the resulting anxiety I get made it very difficult to cede my consciousness to sleep. About a month after that experience as I write this, I am still sober. I still like acid, I still feel like I need it to show me the unexplored parts of me, but I know my sanity has its limits and I am very afraid to test them. I have a newfound appreciation for the work my brain does to construct the vast illusion of consciousness for me every moment I have a newfound appreciation for the work my brain does to construct the vast illusion of consciousness for me every moment, and I am very wary to upset this with psychedelics in the future. If I ever drop acid again I am going to do it pure, and I'm going to do it with people I know, in a place I'm familiar with. If I ever have the courage to do it again. I know it is self absorbed to think this but I seriously doubt any trip could be any more terrifying than that, more debilitating. Very few other trip reports I have seen adequately describe this experience, but those I have read, are pretty accurate. It came without warning, plunged me into hell for eternity, and shoved my broken spirit directly back into my physical brain with no time for adjustment. I could actually hear and see physical fragmentation and snapping, like shards of broken glass, only made of my memories being formed. It was a violent and confusing mess. I know how people can have divine rebirth. That is what happened to me. The divinity I experienced was not enlightenment or nirvana, but its opposite. That is powerful knowledge, to be that closely acquainted with infinite suffering. It acquainted me with the true nature of sensory processing, and the fact that every moment of sensory input can be a moment of infinite terror, depending on how our minds process it. Does energy have consciousness? Is the terror that I experienced the terror that energy experiences for eternity before randomly being assimilated into a being or creature powerful enough to process it? Or is energy  unconscious, dead, and what I experienced was the ultimate innocence, pure energy, being given consciousness for no other reason than to be plunged into a brain incapable of doing anything to it other than torment it. The one major regret is that this experience, as a trip, was almost totally devoid of psychedelic imagery. Very few visuals stand out in my memory. The only other times I have done this much acid, the visuals were going crazy. All in all, I guess I got what I asked for, which was to be high as fuck. I dont know if I ever want to get high again.Exp Year: 2021ExpID: 115364Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 22 Published: Apr 22, 2021Views: 1,123    LSD (2), Cannabis (1) : Bad Trips (6), Post Trip Problems (8), Combinations (3), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:002 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:451 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 1:101 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:215 lbSince junior high, I had always been fascinated by psychedelics. I was, and still am, a person more comfortable in escapism and fantasy than real life. I believed that, through psychoactive drugs, humans could access something more “real” than reality, and that in doing so, they could understand some ultimate truth that would make life better and fuller.Over a period of five years, I tried many different herbs and chemicals in my pursuit of my two oxymoronic goals: ultimate truth, and ultimate fantasy. I was convinced (and in retrospect, deluded) that I could find both of these things, if I just took the right drug in the right place and time. I tried cannabis dozens of times (sometimes wisely and respectfully, sometimes irresponsibly with serious consequences), ketamine, psilocybin, salvia, and copious amounts of tobacco and alcohol to fill in the cracks. LSD was the holy grail among all of these substances, and finally when I was 19 I found a connection that could get me some. After years of searching, I secured four tabs. My plan had been to take two myself, and then take one with my closest friend so we could explore a lesser experience together. Foolishly, I did not stick to my plan. I paid a high price for my arrogance, but that same price also bought me wisdom that has since been invaluable. Aside from the impatience, my mental set was good: excited, unburdened (it was summer vacation from university) and optimistic. I dropped the two tabs I’d planned to hold myself to in the comfort of my own home at about 10:30 PM, after my mother had gone to bed and after a brief 10 minute meditation to center myself. Then I waited eagerly for the come up.The first sensation was a sort of warm, metallic, tight feeling in the base of my throat, along with full-body energy. I felt as though my extremities were becoming somewhat fuzzy, and my breathing grew shallower. I felt flushed, and my mood elevated. It had only been about 45 minutes since I’d taken my two tabs, but I suddenly wanted to ensure that I had an intense, high-level trip to fully plumb the depths of my subconscious (and, hopefully, the outer reaches of the universe). So, I took a third tab, rationalizing that I could just give the last one to my friend to use on his own.I was clearly already not in my right mind, the LSD creating a mania that was impairing both my judgment and personality. Under all normal circumstances, the thought of cheating a friend out of anything I had promised would have been abhorrent to me, but I thought nothing of screwing my soul-brother out of the trip he had paid for. Unfortunately, any cognitive dissonance was completely washed away as the first OEV’s started to appear.I was standing in my office, which is adjacent to my small bedroom. The office has several large shelves of books, and a medium-sized wooden desk that supports my computer and monitor. As I stood in the middle of this space, I noticed that purple and yellow patterns, somewhat like fingerprints, were appearing before my eyes in the darkness. They twisted and flittered about in ways that reminded me of bacterium, swimming through bodily fluids with their flagellum. My mood continued to rise, and I began to giggle with pleasure and wonder at what I was seeing. I had never experienced OEV’s this powerful before, and I lay down on the hardwood floor to stare up at the darkness and let the visions progress.After an indeterminate amount of time spent giggling on the floor, with the visuals becoming more and more vivid, colorful, and fractal, I decided to put some music on. I was heavily into Japanese Rock at the time, and selected the song “Blue Train” by Asian Kung-Fu Generation from my computer. I was still fairly cognizant, so getting the song playing was not overly difficult so long as I maintained concentration. As the first iconic chords began to play, I leaned back in my swivel chair and let myself go into the music.I experienced no synesthesia, but the music completely absorbed me. I felt as though I were mentally surfing the sounds, and I took great pleasure in focusing on particular instruments and following them while excluding all the others. I discovered new aspects of the song that I had never noticed before, and felt exceptionally proud of myself for both my observations and how well I was handling the drug. I felt sure that hours had passed, and glanced at the computer clock: 11:40.I felt a twinge of disquiet, but of an extremely inappropriate nature. I wasn’t tripping hard enough! I recalled the general patterns of trips, and by my estimate, I would be approaching the peak in only another half hour or so. If I was still this cognizant, then it was clear that I was resisting the drug. I resolved to make the third, and fatal, mistake: I took the fourth tab.After dropping, there was a short plateau. I moved from the office to the living room and turned on the TV, to find something interesting to watch and see how my mind reacted. I found a children’s theater production of “Gulliver’s Travels,” and for the next half an hour I watched, fascinated by the fantastical imagery in the film and enjoying the warm body sensations I was experiencing. I squirmed on the couch, feeling the fabric on my face, my hands, my stomach, my feet… I was unable to control myself and sit still. Touching was simply too powerful of a sensation.The short film ended, and I turned the television off, unsure of what to do next. At this point, I believe that the third tab was in full swing and the fourth was on the way up. I was starting to lose track of my thoughts. They would race through my mind in recursive loops, but generally following the same theme: “acid is incredible.”I drifted into my bedroom and began to explore. My room, normally a tiny space consumed by a twin bed and a dresser, now seemed to be enormous. I nearly got lost stumbling the two steps from the threshold to my bed, and flopped onto it with an explosion of giggles.It was full dark in my room, but my night vision seemed exceptionally clear aside from the roiling colored patterns. I noted this and resolved to go to the bathroom and see if my pupils had become dilated, as I had heard they do when using LSD. But first, I grabbed a small stuffed companion: a six-inch high “dust bunny” from the Studio Ghibli film “My Neighbor Totoro,” nothing more than a fuzzy black ball with large googly eyes. I had bought three on a trip to Japan, and had given two away as gifts, keeping the third for myself. Now I was glad I did: he was going to be my trip buddy.My “friend” and I went to the bathroom, and turned on the light. I stared, amused, at my reflection in the mirror, holding the dust bunny in one hand and having it look into the mirror as well. I let out a short burst of laughter: we looked like quite the pair of stoners. My pupils were so dilated I could no longer see my irises. My eyes were like my stuffed companion’s: black orbs on a white background. I surmised that this dilation was probably responsible for my enhanced night vision, and felt quite pleased with myself for this deduction.I wanted to experience a new sensation, and taste and smell seemed like excellent candidates. I stumbled downstairs to the kitchen and found a container of honey roasted peanuts. Their flavor was beyond intense: it was cloyingly sweet, in an artificial manner, and beyond that sweetness was a wholesome nutty flavor that completely seduced me. I stood by the refrigerator, eating peanuts one by one with exquisite slowness. Then I heard a scream.Under ordinary circumstances, I would have thought nothing of it. My neighborhood is close to downtown Chicago, a mere bus ride away from Michigan Avenue. At night young people were out at the bars, and they often make a commotion. But in my altered state, this (probably gleeful) scream sounded like the howl of a banshee. I froze, nearly literally: my internal temperature suddenly plummeted and I began to shiver.I looked at my tripping companion, and his large eyes now seemed worried. I concurred that things were not as jolly at they had been merely seconds (or was it minutes? Hours? Time was becoming increasingly hard to comprehend) ago, and we beat a hasty retreat to the bedroom. I got under the covers, shuddering violently, and tried to ride out the bad vibes.But it only got worse. The shivering did not end, and the visuals were becoming first tiresome, then disturbing. My room was growing larger and larger, and I was seized with a horrifying mixture of agoraphobia and claustrophobia. I had to get out… and I had to stay in. Neither and both were critically important. Then I began to experience aural hallucinations: I heard hoofbeats, drawing closer and closer. I became convinced that the Headless Horseman, an old childhood demon, was coming for me, and he was bringing a posse. He would ride in through my window any second now: my frying brain could see him now, laughing with hellish, malevolent glee, riding hard to take my soul.I had my last coherent, rational thought at that moment. I needed to call my friend who had given me the acid, and tell him that I was having a bad trip. Over the phone, he would surely be able to talk me down. I summoned up all the trip reports I had read, trying to reassure myself that I had only taken a drug and that it would eventually end. Then my mind was overwhelmed, dragged down by a riptide of psychedelic fury. I can only presume that at that point, the fourth tab peaked alongside its three siblings. At this point, I have no idea how much time passed, and I am amazed I can still recall everything that happened. But I was completely psychotic, and no longer able to differentiate my thoughts from reality. My ego was breaking down, and what would be raised up in its place would be complete megalomania.I had a simple thought, that rang out in my mind like a clear bell in early morning: go take a shower. I went downstairs to the bathroom, stripped, and turned on the shower. The sound of the water and the heat of the steam eased my shivering, and I sighed with relief. I stepped into the shower.Then I began to spit. Large amounts of phlegm were being expectorated with each spit, but I no longer understood this to be a side effect of LSD. Instead, I thought that I was purging out my very essence: everything that was me was coming out in this spits, and with each one my physical body was diminishing. I was regressing, becoming smaller in body and mind with each spit: I was returning to the womb. I suddenly understood, with perfect clarity, that this had happened many, many times before. I was repeating a cycle, like the phoenix, of death and rebirth, and it always happened when I was nineteen. I would find acid, take it, and revert to an infant, only to grow up and repeat the cycle again. I was repeating a cycle, like the phoenix, of death and rebirth, and it always happened when I was nineteen. I would find acid, take it, and revert to an infant, only to grow up and repeat the cycle again. As I continued this regression, I began to have intense flashbacks to my actual childhood. I recalled sitting in the bathtub, probably no older than three, playing with a measuring cup in the water and smiling up at my beloved mother. I remembered the first birthday celebration I attended for a friend, eating a chocolate cupcake with white frosting while sitting on a small plastic chair with several other toddlers. I recalled standing up in my crib, reaching out to my father as he bent down to pick me up.The regression continued, past my birth, and I realized with a shock that my timeline actually extended to before my birth. I entered the role of my father, wearing his trademark blue bathrobe, wandering the house late at night, with my wife (mother?) with child, sleeping uneasily. Then time went forward again, and I came to my present self again, sitting in the shower and huddling against the faucet.I was filled with an incredible sensation, an overwhelming feeling of power and destiny. I had faced my cycle, the LSD recursion, and now I had a choice: I could live the cycle again, or step outside of it. If I moved beyond it, then my fate would be entirely of my own choosing: I would begin a new life, free from all negativity, with all my closest friends, for as long as I wished. I saw past the veil of existence and into the truth. I was an enlightened being, a Buddha! No, more than that: I was omnipotent, immortal, and free from the chains of my human body. I could shape the universe to my will, and the cosmos would bow before me, if only I seized this power and would let go of my petty fear and puny mortality.I left the shower, shrugged on my robe, and strode out of the house. I left through the front door, and saw the first edges of dawn were appearing. As expected: I had advanced time forward so that the sun would witness my rebirth. I walked down the middle of my street, my robe open, feeling the cool spring breeze upon my naked skin, and shouted to the sky for the joy of it. I was God, made flesh and now allowed to ascend to My divine being once more. I would rule in heaven alongside my chosen companions, and together we would forge a new covenant with reality! I resolved to head straight to my soul brother’s house, awaken his latent spirit, and together we would awaken the others. I decided I would continue to walk, as an ordinary being, although if I wanted to I could shed my human form and fly. But not yet: it was enjoyable, to be human in flesh yet divine in spirit, the height of ecstasy. I approached the busy thoroughfare of Ashland avenue, where cars were zipping by.I confess that I do not know if there is a God, or any creation spirits in the universe at all, but some force from either within my deluded mind or without convinced me to turn around and not walk out into Chicago traffic in the middle of the night. My “awakened” consciousness rolled with it, deciding on a whim that it was too soon to awaken anyone, and to return to my mortal abode for a time to better understand my new powers and destiny. So I turned around, and escaped certain injury or death.I walked in my wide-open front door, still raving loudly about how everything was so clear, so wonderfully magnificent, and that I was the Lord incarnate. My mother came downstairs, sleepy and confused, asking me what was happening, what was wrong, why I had left the front door open.I goggled at her, then laughed cruelly. She looked so frail and old, standing there in the hallway with her hand closing the top of her robe. She looked like my mother, but I knew that she was not actually there. She was a manifestation of my decaying mortal mind, trying feebly to restrain my ever-expanding consciousness. She looked like my mother, but I knew that she was not actually there. She was a manifestation of my decaying mortal mind, trying feebly to restrain my ever-expanding consciousness. A mental artifact, nothing more. She did not deserve the slightest acknowledgement. I pushed past her and headed upstairs, continuing to shout and gesticulate. My mother followed me, her voice becoming more and more worried and frantic. She said that I wasn’t making any sense, and that I was scaring her. She asked me what was happening, and if I was all right.This construct of my cowardly old mind was starting to irritate me. It was playing dumb, trying to distract me from my ascension. I dealt with it briskly: I told it that had taken four tabs of LSD, and it had awakened my innate divinity. I was a God, and you were a construct of my old mortal consciousness I had no further use for. I dismissed the construct and decided to head out to the porch, perhaps the roof, to take in the coming dawn.The construct that looked like my mother barred my path, screaming. It said I was frightening her, that it wanted to know why I had taken acid, who had given it to me, that I could not leave. I regarded this old part of my life with a mixture of amusement and contempt. How could I have tolerated such a shrewish, cowardly part of myself for so long? I commanded it out of my way, and shoved forward to the door.My mother fought me to stop me from going outside, and in the scrabble I hurt her hand and wrist on the door. I am much larger than my mother, and stronger, but thankfully I was so intoxicated that I could bring no real strength to bear on her. Once again I was saved from horror by providence or sheer luck: if I had been more focused, I could have seriously hurt her.As it was, I was bemused to find that this construct of my former self was still quite powerful, able to repel my godhood. I decided that I still had too much of my mortal self clinging to my soul, and had to be rid of it. I stumbled back downstairs to the shower, to continue purging. On the way I pulled a potted plant down off the banister on the stairway, and it fell ten feet to the kitchen floor below. I took a few moments to sit in the dirt and play with it, my robe lost somewhere on the stairs. Then I headed into the shower.I stood under the shower, chuckling at the remarkable power of the human spirit. “Truly, it’s all perception,” I said to myself, and it clicked: that was the final piece I needed to understand. It was all perception! Each human perceives the world in their own unique way, and in their perceiving it, they create it. It was just like how, in physics, mere observation of atomic phenomena alters the state of the observed: perception of reality defined reality. Depending on how I perceived things, I could literally change the universe!There was a knock from outside my mind.“Sir? Come out of the shower and get dressed. This is the police.”“OK, in a minute,” I reply, amused at this latest attempt by my former unenlightened shadow to nip my ascendancy in the bud. Now it was taking on the form of that impersonal authority, the “police,” to “control” me. Well, I wasn’t going to fall for that. I would shut them out of my perception, and the figments would be banished. I stood in the shower.Another knock. “Sir, come out now and get dressed.”“I will when it pleases me to do so,” I replied, and then decided that it pleased me to do so now. These artifacts of consciousness were really getting out of hand. I had to get them under control.I stepped out of the shower, dried off, and emerged naked from the bathroom. Two policemen appeared to be in the kitchen; the light was now on. The figment that looked like my mother was sitting at the kitchen table, staring horrified at my godhood.“Sir, put some pants on.”“I don’t think I’d like that. I’m fine naked, thank you.”“Sir, put some pants on or we’ll put pants on for you.”I shrugged. “It’s all perception,” I muttered, and put pants on, to appease the figments. They had a certain, powerful insistence to them that I found hard to deny.“Sir, put shoes on.”“I’d really prefer not to.” The figments insisted. I put shoes on, and said, “it’s all perception.”“Sir, put your hands behind your back. We’re going to cuff you.”“Oh, I really don’t think I will. This has gone far enough: I order you to disappear.”“Sir, put your hands behind your back, or we will have to force you to do so.”I considered defying them again, but I was beginning to feel more and more tired. And dizzy. Things were starting to lose definition. “It’s all perception,” I muttered, and put my hands behind my back. They cuffed me and took me out of the house.At this point my memory deteriorates. I remember lying facedown in what I can only presume was an ambulance, my hands cuffed, swaying with the turns. I remember being wheeled in a gurney, and hearing two nurses speaking in disgusted tones: “what happened to him?” “Oh, he took a bunch of acid.” “Acid? What a loser! This isn’t the 70’s anymore!” This may or may not have actually happened.I am in a bed, strapped with to the bed cuffs. The cuffs are poorly fastened: I burst from them and try to sit up. Orderlies shove me back down.I am lying on a moving platform, going into a dark tunnel.I am back in the bed, and hooked up to a heart monitor. A doctor is muttering and kicking the machine. I find this ridiculous: that’s an expensive piece of equipment. “Hey, take it easy man, it’s not the machine’s fault,” I say.The doctor is gone. A nurse is telling me that I have to urinate into a cup. I tell them I can’t, I don’t need to pee. “Sir, we need a urine sample. Pee into the cup or we will need to insert you with a catheter.” I tell them that this is unnecessary, and that the urine sample is not necessary either, I simply took a few tabs of LSD and achieved godhood. I am duly given a catheter, sans anesthesia. The pain is intense, yet distant. “It’s all perception,” I mumble.I am alone. The catheter is painful. My straps are loosened again. I remove them and begin to attempt to remove the catheter. A doctor sees me and begins to babble in a heavy accent, “no no no! There is a balloon inside of you, you cannot take it out!” I find this utterly ridiculous, as a Foley catheter would use a balloon on the OUTSIDE of the penis, and there is clearly not one there. This doctor is a quack. I tell him so, and continue to attempt to remove the catheter. Orderlies are summoned again.I come to. My mind has, somehow, become my own again. I remember, vaguely, the precise moment when my logical human brain was supplanted and I became a megalomaniacal psychopath. I mostly feel relief that the experience has ended. I got what I had wanted, an intense psychedelic experience, but it was so much more than I had bargained for. I had read about things like “loss of ego,” “delusions,” and “reactions similar to schizophrenia,” but I had had no comprehension of what those things were like to experience.I turned to my right and saw my mother sitting there, smiling sadly at her stupid, stupid son. I grinned, the abashed grin of a dog who shat on the floor, and said, “I really fucked up, didn’t I mum?” She burst into tears. She thought I was going to be insane forever, but now she had her son back.A few hours later I was released from the hospital. It seems that the LSD had caused me to run a slight fever, and since I had done nothing but take hot showers and had not drunk any water, the dizziness and black out could be explained by simple dehydration and minor hyperthermia. The dark tunnel I had seen was an MRI machine, but it had showed no problems. As expected: LSD is not a physically dangerous drug. I was not charged with any crime, and was only liable for the ambulance ride and the deductible on insurance. On this score, I was very lucky as well. My mother eventually trusted me again, although rebuilding that trust was a long process. There are emotional scars I left on her that will never heal; I carry a few myself, mostly of guilt for hurting her and a sort of psychic PTSD. Sometimes I remember how close I was to getting myself killed, or wonder if that psychosis had not ended, and I feel a terrible dread and fear that clings to me like cobwebs for hours.In the end, my ultimate realization that everything is “perception” was absolutely true. But now that I can once again bring a sober mind to bear on the experience, I understand that my revelation was only partly understood. It is true that human experience, and reality, is strongly influenced by our perceptions. An optimistic outlook can powerfully alter a circumstance to make a difficult issue solvable. Likewise, a pessimistic one could make a solvable problem appear to be impossible.  But just because perception affects reality doesn’t mean that perception DICTATES reality. Humans can and will impose perceptions upon reality that are warped, and can thus perceive reality incorrectly. We can perceive seven dollars when there are actually six, but we are no richer for doing so. My LSD experience completely dissolved this boundary for me, and I believe that merely imposing my will on reality made my perceptions true. But this is wrong: will power is merely the beginning of changing reality. After will, must come action. THAT is how perception shapes reality: when we not only will for change, but also act. I can will my thirst away, but only a drink can quench it. I can will to be successful, but only hard work can make it happen. I can will words onto the page, but I must use my fingers to impose that will and create something from nothing. It has been four years since this experience, and I have only used psychoactive substances a handful of times since. I learned what I needed to learn, and no longer want to run from my life. I try to seize it, and forge my destiny the real way: through will, through work, and through love.Exp Year: 2009ExpID: 102779Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 19 Published: Jun 23, 2021Views: 2,863    Meditation (128), LSD (2) : Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Bad Trips (6), First Times (2), General (1), Mystical Experiences (9), Families (41), Music Discussion (22), Various (28) DOSE: T+ 0:0040 mgoralOxycodone   T+ 0:30  smokedCannabis   T+ 0:30  oralCannabis(extract)  T+ 1:303 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 1:301 tabletoralMDMA BODY WEIGHT:145 lbRecently, two friends and I attended an electronic music festival in Miami. Over the course of the night, I consumed 40mg oxycodone, 3 hits of LSD, ~200mg of MDMA and a substantial amount of weed. I am very experienced with LSD and MDMA, both together ('candyflipping') and alone. This was only my second time taking oxycodone & my first time combining it with anything other than weed. The combination of LSD + MDMA + oxy seems to have potential to be good. This time unfortunately was a bad trip, but I don't think it was the fault of the combo itself, more the apprehension of trying a new combo with minimal reasearch (always research your drug interactions BEFORE you do them, be safe!). 2:00PM EST: Once we get to Miami, I dissolve 4 perc-10s (40mg oxycodone) into a bottle of Gatorade. This was only my second time taking any type of opiate, so 40mg hit me hard. Fast forward 30 minutes and I was in a state of complete bliss. Nodding out, music sounded great, nice warmth and floaty feeling. One of my friends (call him 'A') took 20mg and my other friend (call him 'T') didn't take any. We rolled and smoked three blunts between us, and then split a gram of edible dabs. 3:00PM EST: We check into our hotel in Miami Beach and immediately order an uber to the festival. I was slumped out in the backseat the whole ride, nodding heavily. The dabs start to kick in as well and seem to potentiate the oxy. I'm having trouble staying awake and following conversation. We got inside the festival around 3:30pm, the whole group dropped acid. These tabs were extremely potent...with (supposedly) 200ug on an each blotter. 'T' and I take 3 apiece; while 'A'  only takes 1. 'T' and I also take ecstasy at the same time. The particular pills we had (blue and yellow IKEA press) were reported to be very strong, containing around 210mg of MDMA. 'A' had taken them before and advised 'T' and I to only take half, but we each took a whole because our tolerances at the time were very high. 4:00PM EST: In 20 minutes, I'm already coming up on both the L and MDMA. It struck me how fast and intense the come up was - I was already seeing large green blotches in the sky and getting some tracers. I've done high doses (up to 7 hits) in the past but never felt a comeup this fast and intense.  The music became louder and the air was shimmering like it was heated. At that point, any effects of the oxy or MDMA were overpowered. 'A' and 'T' were also coming up strong. We wandered around a bit, trying to figure out the layout of the festival and where the different stages were. We decide to go to the mainstage first. As we were walking there, I suddenly start to feel funny, a sense of dread and that something was deeply wrong. The  loud music & huge crowd felt overwhelming. I feel a tremendous body load in my chest, my vision darkened and everything took on a red hue. I felt like my halter top was strangling me, and my mouth was dry as a desert. I turned around to find 'A' and ask to use his Camelbak, but he was gone, along with 'T'. I started to panic and look around for both my friends and a water stand. At this point, I couldn't read any signs and couldn't easily recognize faces. The crowd looked like a throng of black spiders against a red backdrop. The MDMA was also starting to really kick in, as I felt surges of energy going through my body. I went up to a woman and asked her for water, but instead of directing me to a water stand, she freaked out and told me to go to a medical tent. I told her that that I didn't need medical attention (only water!) but she grabs my arm and tries to force me to walk over there with her. At that point, I start to believe that I might actually NOT be okay, and that I could die if I didn't get medical attention. At that moment, 'T' reappeared and grabbed me away from the lady. I told him that I was going to die if I didn't go to the hospital, he reassured me that I was going to be okay but it was too late. At this point, I was rolling hard, but the bad acid trip was overwhelming my roll. Instead of feeling light, my feet felt heavy and I was sinking into the ground. Dancing was impossible - even though I partially wanted to, my body just wouldn't cooperate. I couldn't walk in a straight line and the mostly red & black visuals were terrifying & overwhelming. I tried to enjoy the festival, wandering around from stage to stage but I was too freaked out to enjoy the music. Eventually couldn't take it anymore, so I curled up into a ball on the ground, hugging my own knees. 5:00PM EST: 'T' made me get up and walk to a quiet area until I calmed down, but once I calmed down I began to realize that I was still nodding from the oxy. Every time I nodded, it felt like a 10 minute blackout. I'd 'come to' with no idea where I was or what I was doing, I couldn't remember my name or who I was. By the time I recalled that information, I'd nod again and the cycle would repeat. This went on for what seemed like hours, and I was seriously freaking out 'T.' He kept asking me if I was sure that I was okay, which worried me back into thinking I was dying again. He kept asking me if I was sure that I was okay, which worried me back into thinking I was dying again. In between nods, I kept getting strange numbness and tingling all through my body. At one point, I lost feeling in my whole right side. The sides of my head and my sides would tingle periodically, almost to the point of discomfort. Since I didn't do any research about the interaction of MDMA + oxy beforehand, this was seriously disturbing. With T's convincing, I decided to wait it out and see how I felt once the oxy wore off. 8:30PM EST (?): At this point, the oxy had mostly worn off and I'd calmed down a tiny bit but I was still scared. I looked at my phone screen to check the time, but the numbers didn't make sense to me. Time was meaningless. Everything was backwards and spinning. I was convinced that I was going to die but was also rolling the hardest I have in my life. Thus, I kept hugging random people and objects, telling them I loved them and then asking them to take care of me. Someone in front of me collapsed and began having a seizure. In my mind, I thought that they were me and I was witnessing my own death. When the paramedics came and hauled him away, I was fully convinced that they were taking MY dead body and that my soul had been separated and left behind.  At this point, I turn to 'T' and ask him if I had just died. He was tripping equally hard, so he just responded 'maybe, I don't know.'  I closed my eyes & only saw a huge IKEA-press pill rotating slowly and ominously. I took this as an affirmation that I had just overdosed and died, and had been separated from my material body. 9:30PM EST(?): At this point, 'T' and I accidentally wander out of the festival and into the streets of downtown Miami. The ground was rotating and warping, and I felt like I was looking out of a fisheye lens. There are people everywhere but I'm convinced that they cannot see me, as I am merely a floating soul. 'T' remarks on how 'fucked up' we are, and I respond by yelling about how I was fucked up 'before I died.' This leads to an intense feeling of grief, like I was mourning my own death. I end up somehow calling my father and leaving a crazy voicemail about how I 'ate a whole IKEA', got too fucked up and died. (I didnt remember this until I had to deal with the aftermath the next morning.) Eventually 'T' and I realize that we had left the festival grounds, and spend the next two-ish hours pacing up and down the same street block trying to figure out which way leads back inside. At this point, I am still convinced that I no longer have a body or being. Every time I try to speak, too many thoughts go through my head at once and all I can make is an odd screeching noise. I feel as if I'm going crazy and have lost control, as I cannot make a noise other than a screech. 11:30PM EST: By this point, we've sobered up enough to find our way back inside the festival. We catch the final set and reunite (luckily) with 'A' who has been wandering around, lost, the whole time. I'm still fucked up but nowhere like before and no longer rolling. I come to the realization that I am in fact alive and have a material body again, which brings me immense comfort. The festival ends shortly thereafter at 12am & we leave as a group.12:30AM EST: 'T,' 'A' and I are wandering around the area around the venue, trying to figure out a ride back to our hotel. Nobody can remember the name of the hotel, and everyone's phone is dead. We sit down on a park bench and try to come up with a solution, but nobody has a phone charger and we're in a fancy area of Miami. Considering that we're all fucked up and dressed in our rave outfits, people were staring at us. We spend about 3 hours trying to figure out what to do, but I can't keep the same train of thought for more than 30 seconds. I 'realize' that our phones are dead upwards of 20 times, only to forget again half a minute later and suggest again that we call an uber. At this point, it's getting really late and some strange people start approaching us, asking if we're from Miami and asking us for drugs. One man in particular was acting very strange and spooked me out. Afterwards I kept hallucinating and seeing his face hiding behind bushes and at one point right behind where 'A' was sitting. Around  4am we manage to convince someone to get us an Uber for 10$ and head back to our hotel. The visuals have basically gone at this point and an intense mental fog and fatigue sets in. I pass out within minutes of getting in bed, which is unusual for me as I usually cannot sleep for a few hours after coming down off acid.Exp Year: 2017ExpID: 109950Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 19 Published: Sep 8, 2021Views: 1,295    LSD (2), Oxycodone (176), Cannabis (1), MDMA (3) : Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3), Festival / Lg. Crowd (24) DOSE:1 hitoralLSDBODY WEIGHT:62 kgAge: 28 yearsSex: MaleWeight: 62kgHeight 182cmPrevious substances used: MDMA once about a month ago. Drunk about 15 times between 16 and 25 years of age.Sensory separation, ego death, reincarnation.I took one blotter of LSD, which I was told should be 150 micrograms. I took it at 1515 hours.About 45 minutes into it, the ceiling above my bed on which I was lying was making all forms of patterns that were shaking. And it also looked like the ceiling was actually a floor that had a few inches of water on it and the surface was rippling.About an hour into it, every little spot and dot and smudge everywhere on the floor and walls was moving, disappearing and appearing, morphing into insects and bugs and whatnot. The floor in my apartment is a very unique and random pattern, it doesn't repeat itself at all, it is completely random. This was extremely cool, because the patterns that formed on it were insanely detailed and all kinds of small dots of all colors I could imagine were moving on the patterns. And there's also a lot of small smudges and stains on the floor and all of those became little bugs that moves all over the place.I felt as if I had a fish-eye lens on, everything was distorted on the edges of my periferal vision, as if my field of vision was a lot more than normally. The edges of the room seemed to go a lot further. I went to take a shower.In the shower I felt like the water went inside me as it came down and as I looked at my fingers there was some kind of web or slime connecting my fingers to each other. And as I looked at the ground, the water drops on the ground formed incredible patterns that moved in perfect synchronization. All the small smudges of dirt on the edges of my bathroom turned into ants that were running all over.When I came out of the shower I went back to bed, and as I did that I left a bunch of water drops on my blue bed sheets. They were very distinct and my girlfriend (my guide) pointed them out to me and I looked at them. They seemed to keep forming on their own, and as I lifted the covers they kept forming all over the bed sheets. I was absolutely amazed by it!I don't have a good idea of time from here forward, I was pretty much out of it.All the small patterned colored dots on the floor kept getting more and more vivid. My gf put on some music and I kept lying on the bed and waving my arms and my head was filled with all kinds of ideas and shapes and images.And then I got it into my head that I should watch this galactic timelapse video I had found on the web a while back. I had planned on watching it on acid because I wanted to try if I could go into space. When my gf put it on and I was lying on the bed I saw the edge of the monitor because a chair was in front of it. But I was able to move the chair with my mind without moving my head, so that I could see the entire monitor! This absolutely blew my mind, I got up and said: 'NOW I WILL GO INTO THE GALAXIES!' And proceeded to dive into the monitor. And I actually went there! My gf filmed this and the look on my face was absolutely incredible. It was pure amazement, I have my arms up and I go: 'I am in perfect control ... and I AM IN THE GALAXY!' I couldn't see anything else other than the sky filled with the milky way galaxy, stars and clusters of stars and star dust everywhere.After that the trip went completely nuts. I went back on the bed and asked my gf to come hug and kiss with me, and this took the trip to a whole new level. My gf came on top of me and as she was on top of me, pressing against my hips and started kissing me I started to see all kinds of shapes and patterns and I literally felt as if our hips merged together. It felt extremely powerful close to painful, but not bad per se. Our bodies fused together and I started to feel as if my body turned into something else. Like my body was the size and shape of the entire universe and I felt with every part of it. I started to feel as if my body turned into something else. Like my body was the size and shape of the entire universe and I felt with every part of it. Whenever I tried moving a part of my body I felt the movement all over the place, every little movement felt everywhere I could imagine.I lost all form of self, I didn't have a body anymore and I was something else, I forgot what this world was about and I realized that I was actually the entire universe, a universe that was realizing that it was the universe. And I kept evolving, morphing into new things. I realized that all my life was actually a lie or a figment of my imagination and something else was actually right. And this looped over and over into all kinds of different things that I can't explain. I think I died and was reborn as the universe multiple times.And from here on forward the trip got bad. I started to get flashes where I was walking all over my apartment and my gf was following me and I was extremely disoriented. I would look at all the things in my apartment and then look at my gf and ask: 'What is going on?' And she would go: 'You are tripping on acid.' Then I'd keep going.At this part of the trip I went through dozens of different loops that were all pretty much horribly scary and negative. The loops mostly consisted of things that happened to my mind, stuff like that I realized that I was going insane, I heard it being said in my mind, but I can't remember the words that were used, but it was crystal clear that I was indeed going insane and I felt as if that had been going on for hours, I was going insane over and over.And then the loops turned into something else. I was suddenly an old granny, my voice was high and sort of screechy and I was walking around in my apartment. And my memory kept skipping so that I would suddenly realize I was in the kitchen and I would turn to my gf and ask: 'What's going on?' And she would go: 'You walked into the kitchen.' Which obviously turned in my head into that I was an old granny that had a memory problem and I was walking around unknowingly. All the little bottles of vitamins we have around the house were obviously my medicine cos I was old, sunglasses were my old granny glasses cos I obviously didn't see well. As I looked at my facebook page I could see my children and grandchildren send me messages.I kept finding myself in the toilet and kept asking my gf: 'Did I go?' And she would go: 'No, you just came here and did nothing.' Then the trip kept going worse, I started to feel a weird feeling in my testicles, so now I was obviously an old man with testicular cancer. I was dying, I saw people send me goodbye notes on facebook, so that meant I was close to dying of cancer. I went to lay on the bed and said (on camera): 'well, I gotta say that, I had a good run!' And turned to face the wall. And seemingly accepted my death. At this point there was a sad song coming out of my computer that reminded a little of a funeral song. I ACTUALLY felt as if I was in a coffin in my own funeral and I was carried in church as the song was going. And I embraced death. I kept dying many times in these loops and each time I realized I was dying, I embraced it. I even remember saying: 'Finally, this is what I've been waiting for!' And my gf would ask: 'What is that?' I would answer: 'Death!' (Note that I have not had a suicidal thought in my entire life.) I also died from suicide by knife and by going out on a car while drunk.And during these loops there were also places where I understood that something fundamental was happening in my mind, I was realizing that something was happening that was the worst thing that could happen in my mind, something that I had spent my entire life trying not to experience, and I kept experiencing it over and over. Stuff like, going insane, suddenly starting to believe in god (life long atheist), my gf telling me she's cheating on me, suddenly realizing I was gay. There were a lot of these, and each felt like the worst possible thing that could EVER happen to me.After this, I pretty much came to my senses and didn't experience any more memory skipping or other visions. I was back in my room with my girlfriend. I was laying on the bed and she was sitting on a chair next to me. And this was the beginning of the scariest part of the trip by far...I was back in reality, but it felt absolutely unreal. The room was slightly distorted, the colors were extremely vivid and every single surface that had even a little bit of texture was moving extremely powerfully. The curtains that have a complex texture were moving and shifting and morphing. The floor was filled with moving patterns of bright colors and bugs and insect. Everywhere I looked I saw small things quivering and moving and morphing, as if every texture in the world was animated.And then my girlfriend started to talk... a lot. Extremely calm, extremely articulated. Not that she's not like that normally, but it felt absolutely unreal. I simply couldn't say anything. After what I had gone through, I had just died multiple times, I had become the universe and had my body distorted and destroyed and so on. The experience I had just gone through was so powerful that I was convinced that I had ACTUALLY died. Or at least was in a coma in real life, that I was sure that this was not the real world. I was certain that this woman that looked like my gf was actually an imposter, here to 'take care of me' in my 'limbo' if you will.The strangest thing was that I could not feel my body. I couldn't feel that I was breathing. I couldn't feel that my muscles did anything when I moved around. Everything felt as if I had just been placed into this fake body in a simulation. And I was 100% certain this was the only possibility. But I could not comprehend how this could be possible. I have been a logical, scientific thinker all my life. And I could not understand how my brain could create such a world for me. I have been a logical, scientific thinker all my life. And I could not understand how my brain could create such a world for me. My girlfriend kept talking and I tried to find something in her speech that would indicate that she wasn't real. I tried calling her phone to see if it would connect, and it did. She looked at me with a smile and said: 'Why did you do that?' And it felt SO weird, I was convinced that she knew I didn't believe this was real and she was wary that I would freak out. I kept trying to figure out what the hell was going on.I tried doing a few push ups just for the hell of it, and I couldnt feel any strain on my muscles. I am not a very athletic person but I couldn't feel anything. I could feel that my brain registered that I was doing physical work, but I couldn't feel my muscles doing it.We went out for a walk and I couldn't feel anything. It was pretty cold, but I couldnt feel it. I couldnt feel myself walking, I still couldnt feel myself breathing and every car and person going past us seemed to look directly at me, as if they knew. As if they were already part of this reality and I had just entered it and everyone knew it.I called my friend to see if he would pick up and he did, we chatted for a while and he seemed normal. Then I called my brother and asked what he was doing. He was at home so I said we'd come by and he said ok. So we walked through the city at night, and all through the walk I felt nothing. I usually get at least a bit winded if we walk fast, but I felt nothing.While we were walking I tried to explain my gf what I thought. I told her that I was convinced that I had died and I was in either a limbo, an afterlife or a parallel universe. And her reply was so calm! She just said: 'Hmm, that's interesting that you think that you're in a parallel universe...' At this point I broke down crying for a few seconds and told her that I am in total panic about what's going on. And she just said: 'Don't worry, it's OK.' She is never this calm, but later she told me that she just did her best to keep her composure so that I wouldn't freak out more and that she was actually really freaked out as well.We went to see my brother and sat down talking for a bit and then my brother gave us a lift home. Even then I was still not sure if I was in the real world. Then my gf started to show me the clips she had filmed about me. And watching them I slowly started to come to and realize that I had just gone through an ego death and coming back after that...So basically I experienced ego death but was completely lost as to what happened after that, so basically the end of my trip, in which I could have started to rebuild myself was lost because I was so confused and afraid about what was actually going on.All in all, an extremely scary trip but the most amazing experience of my entire life. A few weeks and I'll try that again. :)Exp Year: 2011ExpID: 90846Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 28 Published: Oct 26, 2021Views: 552    LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Guides / Sitters (39), Glowing Experiences (4), Bad Trips (6), First Times (2) DOSE:3 cupsoralCoffee  5 oralLSD(blotter / tab)   repeatedsmokedCannabis BODY WEIGHT:135 lbBad / Psychotic TripI had been living with a group of four-ish people for around 2 months when this happened, kinda just chilling at the same house. I was really into one of them. It was a pretty normal day to begin with. Nothing major happened that day to affect my mindset. I'd say I was pretty positive/maybe a little anxious going into this. At around 6:00 pm I drank 3 small cups of black coffee trying to get a caffeine buzz and smoked weed with it.Sometime after that, we left for another friend's house. They had come back from their plug and had a sheet of unperforated LSD. It kinda just looked like construction paper, it was definitely thicker than a normal tab, and had brown staining on the back of it. It was tasteless though. They offered us pieces for free, and the piece I took was probably about the size of my thumbnail, I guess if it was cut into regular tabs it would've been about four or five. I think we took it at around 11:00 pm. My memory from the peak is fragmented, so midnight to 3 am is just roughly in order.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------11:00 pm I honestly wasn't too worried right after taking it. I was just felt like whatever would happen would happen. I'd just trip harder than last time I did acid. I honestly wasn't too worried right after taking it. I was just felt like whatever would happen would happen. I'd just trip harder than last time I did acid. 11:30 pm Someone else (who was on around 3x as much as me, and dropped before we got there) seemed like he was tripping TOO hard. He was starting to say things like "wow", "oh my god", "I didn't know this was possible", and confirming that the acid was way stronger than they thought it was gonna be. This worried me, cause he has done ten strips before. He was still with us though and I think he ended up having an ok trip.I misinterpreted his reactions, and kinda took it more as like we had taken too much and were gonna not be ok. Hearing this while coming up really hard gave me thoughts of od'ing / fake acid (even though it was completely tasteless).11:40 pm After that happened I just remember the visuals getting more and more intense, and starting to panic quietly. My entire vision starts to like shake/vibrate and kinda twist then reset back before twisting again.12:00 am Sometime around midnight I must've just been sitting there looking scared asf / shaking. I have really bad social anxiety, so idk why I didn't just say I wasn't having a good time. But I started just giving glances / looking at people to try to get someone to notice. Someone asked if I was okay, and I remember saying no. Like it was just getting more intense, past what I thought should be happening. I think I tried laying down in the bathroom to calm down, which felt nice but ultimately did nothing to help.I also took a couple hits of weed at this point to try and calm down (didnt know at the time) and after that my memory just goes out the window, I don't remember too much of what I was thinking during this, and I don't really know what order the next sequence of events comes in:12:00 - 3:00 am So one thing that happened is, I kept looping walking between their living room, their outside porch, and I think the bathroom. Not really talking to anyone that I can remember. At one point I ended up standing in the lawn just saying the word "hospital" to my friend cause it felt like my skin was burning / I am have a heart attack. (I really think high doses of caffeine are not good to mix with LSD, and probably caused a panic attack.)I remember standing outside, going between my skin freezing and burning, and my friend (the one I liked) gave me a jacket, and I couldn't figure out how to put it on. So I just ended up wearing it like a blanket. Also, I couldn't remember his name or who he was, I recognized him as someone I know still, but not who. I also couldn't really remember who I was or who anyone was.I think I ended up in the living room and sat down after this. I remember hitting a bowl one more time and then just closing my eyes and going into a void. After this, I started thinking I was a god and having delusions that I could fly, or just will anything to happen if I thought hard enough.I also felt simultaneously that I had obviously overdosed on Nbome or something and was dead now, and stuck in some purgatory version of my friend's house cause I died there. Where I would be stuck for eternity as some fucked up test of patience.With that in mind I started trying to run outside in 30 degree weather / fly / jump out the window. They started trying to keep me inside which was a great idea, but in the acid headspace, everyone felt like they had been replaced by alternate versions of themselves, trying to keep me stuck in this place for eternity. I was just being sus as fuck apparently. Someone told me that during this I performed a very graceful box jump onto their table. I also had my shirt off at some point and lost my bra, and was trying to take off more I remember feeling like I was dead/going to end up in hell after that night, and was trying to hold onto literally anything from this world that meant something to me. Like I was grabbing for things / people, and I think every time someone stopped me from grabbing something it felt like they were doing it on purpose to mock me. Eventually between this, and the trying to run outside, someone had to hold me down. I remember him saying something during this and it sounded like his voice was pitch shifted down which scared tf outta me.After this they got me into the living room, and laying down on the couch again. I was still having god delusions AFAIK and remembered thinking at least everything would be ok. I still thought I was in purgatory though, and going to be reborn as someone else, somewhere else in the world.3:00 am This is the first time I remember looking at the clock after coming out of the peak. I just kinda came back to myself while lying on the couch. I felt like all my memories / who I was come back to me. I was still tripping really hard. I ended up just staring at the TV which was like cycling though different Netflix shows to watch, and just enjoying the visuals on some of the backgrounds. They also had a popcorn ceiling, so I ended up just looking at those two things for a couple hours while trying to think if what just happened was real.6:00 am Someone came in to get something / check on me. I think they asked if I was good and said hi and I replied hesitantly, still feeling kinda unsure if they were the real version(?) of themselves. I kinda got out of that though thinking, okay, even if they aren't, at least everything is back to normal, lol.8:00 am I go back into their kitchen where a couple people are sitting. Sometime around 7 am my friend took my car to get back to where we were staying. It just feels like the normal comedown of acid now. Visuals are mostly gone unless I focus on something. At this point, I don't realize that everything that happened last night actually happened yet. We end up just smoking weed and sitting quietly / listening to music.12:00 pm He gets back and I drive us back to where we were staying. I kinda learn a little about what happened last night. I think the embarrassment kept me from asking anymore though. I'm tired af and just go to sleep as soon as we get back.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I still don't really know what happened that night, and still haven't learned too much. I don't think I really got anything from it other than trauma, most of the trip was just panicking and being in pain it seems like. I don't even remember any visuals from the peak cause my memory just got blanked for most of it.I've tripped on LSD / LSA / mushrooms since then and still have good / beneficial trips so at least it hasn't ruined psychedelics for me at least it hasn't ruined psychedelics for me, or brought out any mental illness (other than making my anxiety worse for a couple months). I guess just be careful combining LSD with caffeine / weed. I think the caffeine definitely didn't help with the anxiety, but the weed is what really pushed me into losing control it seems. I don't really know what to think happened that night still. I felt like I'd gone "insane" but not schizophrenia insane, I wasn't hearing voices or anything. Was that just a panic attack or some kinda temporary psychosis?Exp Year: 2020ExpID: 115930Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 19 Published: Dec 16, 2021Views: 861    LSD (2), Cannabis (1), Coffee (173) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:001 hitoralLSD  T+ 6:001 hitoralLSD  T+ 0:00  repeatedoralAlcohol  T+ 0:00   MDMA  T+ 0:00  smokedCannabisBODY WEIGHT:120 lbBad LSD Trip PTSD Cannabis WithdrawalI went to visit a friend the weekend before last, in Wales. I was playing a psytrance set at his new night in the little town he lives in, then a friend drove us to Liverpool for a private psytrance warehouse party. I took two tabs of really strong acid, two different kinds with about 5-7 hours between. I was also pretty drunk and took a little bit of MDMA.Usually, I don't take LSD recreationally... Well I never used to. First time I took it I had a bad trip, thought I was going insane... Took a long time to try it again. Since then I've had many great trips, great insights to my own mind and it has helped me through a lot of shit.Because of this, I became more frivolous about where I when I took it. It was easier to take a little bit with a little bit of alcohol, at parties, just 'for fun'.The trip was actually really good, up until about 3pm the next afternoon when we had to venture into Liverpool city centre then get the train back to Wales. The journey took about 2 hours, two different trains. About half an hour into the first train journey, I started to feel like I was going to have a panic attack. I've had one full-blown once before, after a night of taking ecstacy and a friend getting sexually assaulted in my house. During that, my hands, arms, face and throat went numb, which I now know was due to hyperventilation.So, I couldn't get the fear of this happening again out of my head, and then it started to happen. I was able to keep it to just my hands, took deep breaths and stay ok-ish until we got to Wales. I thought once I got to my friend's house that I would be ok. But I couldn't shake the panicky feeling. I couldn't get to sleep for over 12 hours. My thoughts were getting bad by this point. I couldn't get to sleep for over 12 hours. My thoughts were getting bad by this point. I thought I was dying. I couldn't understand why I was still tripping SO hard.... I thought I was never going to stop. When I finally did get to sleep, I woke up a few hours later feeling even more panicky, heart rate was so fast.... I could hardly breathe. I had to go and lie next to my friend in his bed, and only because of that did I calm down enough to pass out again.When I woke up, I thought I could see blood in my urine. And I was getting abdominal pains. I eventually took myself to the local hospital. It turns out that my urine was just dark from dehydration, but man that SERIOUSLY looked like blood to me.I had to change my flight home to the next day because there was no way I was doing that train journey back to Liverpool again so soon. When I got home, my laptop wouldn't turn on, when all I had wanted to do was lie in bed and watch farscape. Then my 'boyfriend' (we were never really official and the past few weeks have been a headfuck between us) came round, after not really offering much comfort when I told him how I was feeling.... And told me he didn't want to see me anymore. I think if I hadn't taken 10mg of valium before he came round point that I may have broken down completely. (I rarely take valium, a friend gave it to me to help me feel calm.)Since this happened I've smoked a little bit of weed, and it has only seemed to make things worse. I've been a daily smoker pretty much for coming up to ten years now, since I was 13/14. The longest I've gone without a break is 2 weeks.When I finally got on the internet I looked things up about bad trips, and read a shitload about how it can trigger schizophrenia and psychosis. Then the symptoms of these conditions.... And since reading those I have been questioning reality. For a few days I felt like maybe nothing was real. Maybe everything was just a construct of my mind. Or maybe that I died and went to hell. Since last night, I've been having very dark thoughts. You know those weird urges you sometimes get... To do violent and/or crazy things? But that usually just go away as quickly as they come because you know they are crazy? I used to get them sometimes anyway but now that I'm scared of being crazy I seem to be having them uncontrollably. I've even been worrying that if I get worse, I might snap and actually do them. I mean I do not EVER want to hurt anybody, but the fear is there.I have never been so scared.I know that it's probably just a combination of PTSD, reading crap online about LSD and cannabis usage, paranoia, and cannabis withdrawal. And knowing that my great uncle was diagnosed with 'simple schizophrenia', and that it's only been just over a week since the most terrifying experience of my life. But I can't shake the feeling that something isn't right. Also... One of the last times I tripped, after a festival when I was awake for 3 days... As I was finally drifting off to sleep I heard my own voice in my head, a demonic version of it... Telling me that I was going to die. I still don't know if it was just a dream but it scared me a lot.I feel ok on and off.... So I hope that I will be better in a few weeks. I have decided to stop smoking weed completely. It is just not worth the risk. It is hard, because even though it is not physically addictive, I've been using it in pretty much every aspect of my existence for a decade. I smoked to help my bad appetite, I smoked to help my art, I smoked to help my sex drive. Basically the only thing I didnt use it for was to sleep, because it always got my mind racing so much that it would keep me awake.People, please be careful with these substances you put into your body. They are not just harmless fun. And there IS such a thing as TOO MUCH awareness. It got to the point where I actually couldn't stand the sound of my own heartbeat, and the tinnitus that I already have got unbearable. The psytrance I had been listening to all night was still playing in my ears. I couldnt stand the sight of my own reflection. I couldnt stop focusing on my breathing because I was so afraid of not taking deep enough breaths.I have also had muscle twitches when drifting off to sleep, which have now subsided but I've still been getting a twitch in my left shoulder on and off just throughout the days.Truth be told, I have been praying to god. I have been that scared. I was agnostic verging on atheist for a long time. But after this.... I'm so freaked out that I've been thanking god for every moment that I feel sane. I'm very scared of having a flashback as well, even though I've never had one before so I dont know if I am prone to them.I was prescribed SSRIs before this happened, and still havent tried taking them. I basically wanted a few more weeks of partying before going on them. BIG mistake. But now I'm not even sure I wana take them either because the idea of them making me worse for the first few weeks is so terrifying.I love everyone and I do not wish this fear and anxiety on anyone. I dont think I will ever take psychedelics, cannabis or any other drugs EVER again.P.S.- I am now on day 3 of cannabis withdrawal. Last saturday was the first day in years that I didn't smoke anything, and I felt good. The next day I caved and smoked a few pipes, which only brought my negative thoughts back. I am now having even worse intrusive, violent and negative thoughts but I am doing some reading on how to dispel them. It is hard, and sleeping has still been a problem, though the muscle twitches have mostly subsided.I feel irritable and happy on and off. I feel more talkative. My thoughts are still scattered but I can feel them becoming clearer.I feel like life could be more enjoyable sober than it ever was when I was stoned. I feel like I am waking up, and discovering myself truly. I'm not used to my normal thought processes, I feel a bit scared that I don't know who I am, but I'm willing to find out. I am still scared that I may be insane though.I used to wonder how anyone could go through life NOT being high. Now I am realising how fucking foolish that is. I am coming to understand why people fill their time with seemingly mundane tasks, and why a lot of people are scared to explore and expand their consciousness. I am still all for doing that, but drugs are definitely NOT the solution. They can help, but I used them as the one and only method for way too long. I fear I will never be able to do it on my own, but then there are times when I feel like I could have more will power than most people and maybe it is possible. I just hope that spending 10 years high since I was 13 has not done permanent damage. I just hope that I do not go crazy as I get older and my brain starts to deteriorate.I hope I do not relapse again, though I honestly do not have any desire to toke atm. Well, I mean I would LIKE to be able to, but I know that it will do me no good.I've thought about cutting off my dreads/combing them out, and getting rid of everything in my room that reminds me of my stoner life. But I still love my dreads, I think I am just still in a place where everything reminds me of it. Getting rid of these things may not even help. So I'm going to just try to be strong.I am having my birthday celebrations this weekend, I plan to have a couple of drinks but I'm even a bit scared to do that. I will just have to have self control and if I feel it makes me worse I will stop drinking and just focus on chatting to my friends. I may not even drink anything at all, I'll see how it goes.Exp Year: 2011ExpID: 93250Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 23 Published: Jan 22, 2022Views: 798    LSD (2) : Combinations (3), Post Trip Problems (8), Multi-Day Experience (13), Bad Trips (6), Rave / Dance Event (18) DOSE: T+ 0:000.5 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:300.5 hitsoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 1:301 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:49 kgDeath in an Acid Trip*Mindset*Heartbroken + sad. I wanted to see the soft colours that I saw during my previous and first acid trip (quarter-half a 50 ug tab). My ex and I broke up a week before, and I hadn't begun to deal with how abusive the relationship was or how dependent I was and still wanted to be. In the back of my mind I just wanted to go to sleep. Sunset was nearing, the colours were already soft, but I refused my true desire to just sleep and submitted to abusive behaviour on my self.*Setting*My bedroom with high ceilings, and objects that were simply there to decorate the space (which still felt empty). Awful blue carpet. Ultimately the setting was my home, a sharehouse on a busy street. 4000 trucks a day passed by my window. I had absolutely no privacy or peace of mind. My girl housemate would enter my room without knocking and depended on me to look after her when she drank and had psychotic attacks. I was her only friend but she still read my diaries and stole money and things from my room. I was not comfortable around my housemates or in my home.*Dosage*Initially I cut half a tab of internet-bought 75 ug acid. There was no effect after 30 minutes so I ate the other half and licked the plastic pink zigzag scissors. 1 hour later, still no effect, so I tore a full tab and consumed it. All in all, approx 150 ug in a 1.5 hour timespan. The physical effect began 5 minutes after the second tab. My body felt nauseous and I found I was not breathing with ease. Something heavy pressed on my lungs. The pressure and the nausea was a forewarning that a rough ride was ahead so I changed into something all purpose, took off a suffocating bra and texted my ex to come immediately as I felt no one else was experienced enough that was in close proximity (20 minutes drive at most or nearby) that would be adequate in being there for me in the acid state that was to come.Fortunately the fucker came. Playing with my mind for the rest of the trip aside (which has caused some PTSD damage) and taking advantage of my body and state of mind aside, if it weren't for him I would have played a trick on myself and jumped in front of the traffic, I was completely gone.* Below is my account *Taken only one. Waiting for it to start. So I could see the colours differently, so that I could appreciate. I was hopeful.An hour after, I am still normal. I decide to lick the zig zag edges of the pink plastic scissors and tear off another. I need to get out of this resistance. My mind says don't okay, you'll feel better if you just go to sleep. Forget about the pain. Everything will be better. But I'm difficult and unhappy.I am falling and I know because I nag my housemate to do the dishes and laugh at how much I really don't care. Something in me is happiness but I feel sick at myself. Inside my room, I lay down finding it hard to breathe. Turning, asking for help, and in turn girl housemate says she 'won't be around all night'.I quickly find my phone and text the only person I know who knows what it's like and who I know will be there. I still can't breathe and my legs feel cold so I attempt to take off my bra before I know it will descend into too late and I won't be able to do it. It is a tight, suffocating material, one without clamps and when I finally pull it off I change dresses into something warmer and all purpose. My blue velvet dress which as I slip my arms up into it reminds me of the ocean and the heaviness of the dark calm protecting me.When he comes, we sit on the soft grass at the end of the backyard. I can hear colours and I can see the sun starting to set-something it has been doing for the past however many hours. A heaviness creeps up around my chest and weighs down my lungs. I have to stay calm. There are orange, green, yellow and blue tennis balls that children have thrown across fence. One falls near us.His skin and eyes a skeleton, a sickened body. I hear children laughing from everywhere, I feel the warmth and don't want it to fade. I start running to the house but it is different. No one is there. I have to use the bathroom but I don't want to be loud and am unsure of where everyone is. I go to the front of the house and outside again but my brain is only registering some parts of my shifting from place to place.My brain hurts and it feels like it is dying or parts of it are. The dishes are done but the kitchen is dirty. We go outside. To calm down. We go back in and the pale programmer Canadian boy housemate is playing his music that is bass and hate and ugly grind and it is loud I tell him it's shit, it's shit, it's shit!! I run away from them and their bad music. I return with the tide before I can remember, and they are in the living room, watching the news about a lifesaver saving someone. I can't stand the way the tv is talking to me so I ask them to turn it off before pulling the plug.Inside my room my ex and I kiss but he hesitates and I can tell it is an act. I tell him I love him. And I call him my darling. And he holds me tight. Says I am okay. I'm finding it hard to breathe. My hands push him away and my mind tries to make sense of how bright it is when I continue running around the house.When I return to my room, I can hear the hospital and paramedics trying to revive me. I say I will breathe and I will be back again and real. I breathe as deeply as I can. I need to call my mum otherwise I know I am dead. He asks what is real and what is dead? Come on, does it matter?I scream for someone to call an ambulance but no one does. I accept that it is only my consciousness that remains, desperately trying to find something to hold onto, something real. I open the windows wide and screamed at people parked in their cars 'are you real?? Am I real?' and they all just simply look at me. I hear him telling my housemates again that this is all part of the normal reactions and that an ambulance will only make it worse. I feel his voice and the words he says are part of a game put on for me. It freaks me out that they listen and go back to the living room. It is worse that when I find and hold the phone in my hand it lengthens. When my ex sees the phone, he tries to take it off me. I scream and wrestle to have it back, kicking him until it is thrown across the room. I find her number and call. He asks me to promise him I will be calm. I say I promise. As soon as I hear my mum's voice which sounds so far away but next to me I start screaming that I think I am dying and that I need an ambulance. She reacts calmly and I yell I am scared and I need her and I need an ambulance now. My ex grabs the phone and explains what is happening. It ends on that he will look after me and everything will be okay and I presume he hangs up on her. This scares me so much because I feel I am actually dead and that the action of him ending the call to my mum affirms I am not real anymore. I begin to panic as my ex's eyes do not change but his body changes - widens and warps, and my location changes, I run up and down the halls. His words are repeating 'what is real?' and his face is that of understanding. My housemates were not in the living room when I went back.For however long it was, I presume about 20 minutes, I strongly believed that my ex boyfriend was the only thing left that I was talking to and that I was not real anymore. That I was dead. I strongly believed that my ex boyfriend was the only thing left that I was talking to and that I was not real anymore. That I was dead. This was the most horrific part of the trip. I was running up and down my house and my ex would follow me and say things that affirmed my suspicions that I was actually dead - for example, that there is no such thing as physical reality, we are all only energy, that he isn't real and I might not be real and who is to say we are real. I felt really light-bodied and didn't feel connected to anything but to the acceptance that I was dead and none of it was real. (+1hr after the acid started taking effect)So I decided to smash this theory and walk outside. Which surprised him. I walk outside and notice that there are no cars on the road and that every vehicle parked is facing the left. It is extremely strange that there are no cars on this busy road, not even in the distance. But after he says yes, that is strange, some cars pass.So we go for a walk because I don't want to be anywhere near this unmoving house. We decide to leave without shoes and the pavement is warm. Turning the glass in my hand (I was drinking a lot of water), I wonder if it's real. I decide to throw it hard, right out front the apartment building on the corner. I want to see if it will smash into thousands of tiny glass pieces like it's meant to. It makes a beautiful sound and with it my ex is again, surprised. He starts to worry or realise that this will be more intense than he expected. If he wasn't there I'd walk in front of the traffic. But he holds my hand, holds me back.We walk down the street to town and I start knocking on peoples doors to see if they are real, how they will react. I knock on a door that has a do not knock sticker on it. I pass this house everyday. A large Vietnamese burnt sienna coloured house. I knock so insistently and when the door opens I demand a glass of water. After a long while a younger guy opens the door again and gives me a red plastic coca cola cup filled with water which I keep and refill at a tap I've never seen before that my ex pointed out, at the orthodontists.A blonde office worker holds weeds as she crosses the road in front of us and I ask her why. She says it's bunny food. And I say to her that I would never feed a bunny that. We turn a street and I want to be naked to see how people react. If their reactions are real. But my ex convinces me not to. And I agree. Instead, I ask the man coming towards us if he is real. He looks like he's done 'some heavy shit' and is understanding and sympathetic. He said I look too young to be using. My favourite flowers near my ex's house are almost dead but that doesn't stop me from putting my face to them, kissing them, closing my eyes to them and breathing. I calm from being at his house. From being held by my only mama - who came as we were lying in my ex's bed breathing to rainforest music. I am my centre but she is my world.Driving to my wilderness home. Both of my hands are holding theirs. The GPS map changes streets in front of my eyes. Streets I have never seen before. Changing seamlessly when I look. It is quite freaky to see but I also think kind of cool. We laugh in the car when I ask if it is real, and my mama says of course it is not.Looking out the window, I see many small white planes with propellers at the front on fire and about to crash. I tell my ex I am scared of the planes. He asks me very gently if I think they will be okay. I say yes, and they continue on flying and he says, 'see, it's okay' with a kind smile and a squeeze of the hand. The whole trip I had no idea where we were, I didn't recognise the usual streets. After everyone went to sleep, including my visiting family from out of town who did not see me in my coming down state, my ex and I went to the kitchen to eat grapes and then outside to see the sky. All the stars were so much more visible, my eyes wide apertures. I thought I could feel the trees being tired and disapproving of me questioning if it was all real. Like they were too concerned with something else to deal with my nonsense. I received the same feeling from my feline. He was very nonchalant.In my bedroom my ex and I inevitably had sex. After forcing kisses on him earlier, and from having been together for a couple of years, it seemed natural to kiss and hold each other. I didn't want to have sex with him at all because my body was raw from exhaustion, my heartbeat still super fast, and my breathing quick because I still thought I wouldn't keep breathing by myself if I didn't consciously take every deep or shallow breath. My breathing was conscious during the entire trip as I found it hard to breath initially, then I breathed to support my life. My ex kept insisting and I gave in because the way my body felt reminded me of something magical - sensual senses are heightened - but I quickly was reminded that it wasn't something I felt comfortable with when he began porn sex and my heart felt it couldn't take it. He wanted to go to sleep and I couldn't sleep until I walked to the window facing east and saw the beginning of life. Sunlight through the leaves and the familiar bird songs and the rumble of my belly. And I went to sleep.* Note. For months afterwards I have had flashbacks and I recognise symptoms of PTSD in me. I have seen a burning object in the sky moving steadily towards the city. And have read a news story the next day that many other people thought it was a burning plane with no explanation for this event given by authorities. Other small coincidences have occurred that flashed me back to feeling that I wasn't real and induce a state of panic. I have reconciled that there is a lot I have yet to know and understand and kick myself for taking something that has cheated me from having natural slow spiritual learning. Because almost every new learning experience is tainted with my doubts and terrifying experience that I wasn't ready for.Hopefully I can move past this. I think I already have.Exp Year: 2012ExpID: 97641Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 21 Published: Jan 24, 2022Views: 1,020    LSD (2) : Sex Discussion (14), Relationships (44), Bad Trips (6), Various (28) DOSE:1 hitoralUnknown(blotter / tab) 1 hitoralNBOMe Series(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:160 lbAt the beginning of the second semester of college, I wanted to celebrate coming home from a bad vacation by taking my first dose of LSD in a long time. The dosage was lower than last time, but I didn't mind until I took the paper.The paper was more bitter than I expected, and I immediately knew I was ripped off. The paper was more bitter than I expected, and I immediately knew I was ripped off. I did not spit it out later, however, because I just wanted to know how fake acid, or how I like to call it, "Solaris," felt.After ingesting, I started to experience green and purple aberrations after 30 minutes. Rainbow smoke started to drift across my computer screen, and the green and purple aberrations stared to become every color of the rainbow. Admittedly, it was beautiful, and listening to music added to the experience, as the drugs enhanced the music experience.Soon, I felt a metallic taste in my mouth at around two hours. My face went numb, and my motor skills slowly declined while I was drinking soda as I felt like I could start a nosebleed any second. Intense stimulating euphoria washed over me, as well as panic, and I smiled devilishly whenever I walked over to my suite's bathroom mirror.Looking deep into my eyes, I could see that one pupil was larger than the other, and I felt like I had to clean my room and set up my desk microphone to keep myself busy, as advice from other people failed on how to calm myself down, as relaxing activities did not fully stimulate me. Also, my libido was incredibly high, and I felt murderous.After having a disturbing fantasy during my climax, I tried to take a shower and get some sleep, as I was incredibly tired, hungry, and coming down from one of the worst trips I've ever had.Trying to sleep, I had closed-eyed visuals and even audio. I saw millions of futuristic lights, beautiful things, sound-tracked by various excerpts of human speech, digitally altered to create lush ambient music. I would expect people in 2040 to be taking this drug more, admittedly, and after reading Wikipedia, "Solaris" sounded like a good name for this drug to me.Exp Year: 2022ExpID: 116060Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 18 Published: Feb 3, 2022Views: 908    Unknown (120), NBOMe Series (539), LSD (2) : Alone (16), What Was in That?

It was the last time I ever took acid, but not the last time I’ve taken hallucinogens.The trip took place in the winter of 1998, shortly before new year’s. I was 20 years old at the time and I am a male. About 5 of my friends and I went to a dance club in Hollywood and my friend brought a vial of L with him to sell. All of us took 2 hits each and a hit of X each at around 11pm and had a blast at the club.The club closed at 2am and I caught up with my friends who had all taken 1-2 more hits each, so I asked my buddy for the vial…I went to drop one on my tongue but nothing came out. My friend who owned the vial said “just take off the cap, chew on the cap and fill the vial with water and drink that.Now I should mention that at this point I was not an amateur when it came to psychedelics. I had started taking LSD at age 16 (kids, don’t try this at home. Your brain is still developing and I don’t recommend starting at such a young age) and at this point I had done LSD over 200 times, mushrooms like 50 times and mescaline (microdots) once. So I figured I could handle a couple more drops. (Turns out, it was WAY more than a few drops)We heard about an after party going on a few miles away and decided to check it out. We got to the after party and headed inside and that’s when things started to turn.We walked to the back of the club where there was a balcony with seating and we all wanted to sit and chill for a while. There were two staircases leading up the the balcony, one on each side. One side had 4-5 huge steps that you had to basically crawl up, and the other had like 100 tiny steps that you could barely fit half of your foot on. I still don’t know to this day if that was real or part of the trip as I’ve searched for a club that has those stairs but never could find anything on it.So as we were sitting on the balcony, I was watching the crowd and I noticed a man by the entrance on the opposite side of the building, staring at me. He began to weave his way back and forth in the audience, the whole time getting closer and closer and never breaking eye contact. The man looked exactly like Paul Bearer, The Undertaker’s Manager.I had a huge wave of paranoia and told my friends that I needed to get some air. Two of them came with me because they could tell I was not in a good place. We crossed the street and sat down against a wall. We sat there for maybe 10 minutes and my visuals were getting heavier and heavier so as a last resort I asked if we could go get some milk somewhere.We got up and started walking down the street towards a McDonald’s that was 2-3 blocks away. As we were walking, the bricks in the sidewalk were popping up to about 3 feet in the air and then popping back into the sidewalk. Kind of like a whack-a-mole. It took me forever because I was trying to dodge the bricks. All the times I had done LSD before had been 1-3 hits and I had never had visuals that weren’t actually there.We finally walked up to the door at McDonald’s and it was closed. My friends pounded on the door until one of employees came to the door. My friends explained the situation and the employee was nice enough to let us in so we could buy a milk. We walked up to the counter and as my friends were paying, I had the feeling of something watching me and slowly turned around to find that the restaurant was full of diners, and they were all silently staring at me. This was at around 3:30-4 am and there were definitely NOT any diners in the restaurant. I told my friends I’d be outside and noped right out of there.Once my friends were outside they gave me the school sized milk and we began to walk back to the club. As we were walking back the carton slipped out of my hand and fell at super slow mo speed. It took about 10-15 seconds to hit the ground, and then the milk splashed out, also in slow motion and hit the sidewalk 4-5 times. Also, the whole time this was happening, cars were driving by at normal speed.As we walked up to the club there were several ambulances outside and we sat across the street. My logical explanation for the ambulances were that everyone in the club had taken bad drugs and we had all died. I panicked and got up running down the street yelling that I needed to say goodbye to my parents before I died. I lived about 15 miles away and I had no idea where I was. Luckily, my friends were able to chase me down and convinced me to come back somehow. We got back to across the street from the club and we sat down again. The ambulances were gone. My friends were trying to comfort me by telling me I just took a little too much and that I’d be fine in a few hours. The thing was, that’s NOT what I heard them telling me. My friends were trying to comfort me by telling me I just took a little too much and that I’d be fine in a few hours. The thing was, that’s NOT what I heard them telling me. In my mind, and to my ears, they were saying “You took too much man. And you candy flipped?! You are probably gonna die,” and things similar to that.As I sat there full of existential dread, guess who decides to come out of the front doors to the club. That’s right! Paul Bearer! He slowly crosses the street as cars zoom by him and he stops a foot away from my friends and I and just stares at me for what felt like 15 minutes without saying a word or my friends acknowledging that he was there, then he turned around and went back in the club. After a while my friends saw a Mercedes pull up in front of the club and my buddy said it was his X supplier and we needed to go with him into the car. Afraid to leave my friends I had no choice but to comply. We got in the car and the dealer was visibly upset. He told my friend he needed to pay him what he owed soon or there would be consequences. Then he turned to me and offered me a hit of GHB. I just shook my head no and he kept insisting and I kept refusing which made him mad. My friends were explaining that I was having a bad trip and I didn’t want to take it. He finally, frustratingly agreed to let us out with a final warning to my friend.We went back into the club and found our way back up to the balcony where the rest of our friends were. We sat there for a bit but I was still having a bad time and I asked if we could go home. They said “Yeah, but we don’t have enough room in the car for everyone. You’ll have to ride in the trunk.” I said nope, I’m not riding in the trunk. My friend said “Well it’s either the trunk, or you have to go home with this guy.” I looked to my left and wouldn’t you know it, Paul Bearer is standing next to me. I quickly agreed to ride in the trunk and we left the club.When we got to the car, everyone got in the car and I stood at the back waiting for them to pop the trunk. After a minute or so, the driver popped his head out and said “What are you doing man? Get in the car.” I told him I was waiting for him to pop the trunk and they all laughed. “What are you talking about?! Man you are REALLY fucked up huh?” This is when I came out of the main peak, but I was nowhere near finished tripping. I had never tripped so hard I had visuals that weren’t actually there, let alone auditory hallucinations where I was hearing something completely different than what they were saying.We drove home and the visuals were EXTREMELY strong still and would be for several more hours but I was at least somewhat back in reality now. When we got home I had my friend buy me an 18 pack of beer and over a few hours I drank most of them trying to quit tripping so hard. All that accomplished was my mind was totally sober (aside from the acid) but my body was DRUNNNNK. I stumbled around the apartment for several more hours and finally fell asleep in the late afternoon.I stopped the acid after that and it was several years before I would try another hallucinogen. I’ve done shrooms maybe 10 times since and DMT twice.Exp Year: 1998ExpID: 116085Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 20 Published: Feb 3, 2022Views: 517    LSD (2), MDMA (3) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Various (28) DOSE:1 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:65 kgThis story starts in my bedroom, a fairly cold, damp and small space. It wasn't the best room, but it was mine and I loved it. At the time I had been having a hard couple of weeks with my mental health, suffering from some fairly severe anxiety and stress issues. I have suffered with anxiety all of my grown life, but it gets more severe during times of high stress. At the time work was very stressful. In addition, my country was under strict social restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All these factors combined make for a very bad situation to be taking psychedelics, but at the time I underestimated the power of LSD and did not respect it as I should have.I decided in the morning to take some of the LSD I had bought online a few months ago, after a particularly difficult night. This was motivated by past positive experiences I have had with psychedelics (mostly psilocybin), which had really changed my world view and helped a lot with my longer term mental health issues. I was aiming to get some clarity on the causes for my anxieties I was aiming to get some clarity on the causes for my anxieties, and potentially to access some difficult truths that I was in denial about that I could use to improve my mental health. I took the tab (unknown strength) in the late morning, as I knew LSD lasts a long time and I wanted it to be done at a reasonable time for sleeping. I stuck it on my tongue and let it sit for a while, then chewed it up and swallowed. At the time I didn't think much of it, I just watched some miscellaneous videos on my computer. +1h00 I was starting to feel the effects. I felt a bit "wobbly" and strange, and the music I was listening to at the time started to really feel very intense and almost take over my mind. At this point I would describe the feeling as fairly positive. I put on some of my favourite music on my phone and went to lie down on my bed and listen to it. I was still alone in my room. I lived in a shared household at the time, and my plan was largely to keep to myself - I hadn't informed anyone else I was going to be tripping.+3h00 I had been listening to the music for a long time, and had been really entranced by it. I was experiencing intense visuals which were very geometrical and consisted of thousands of infinitely tessellating fractals. It was really very beautiful but also incredibly intense. At this point I felt inspired to go and create some art, so I got out my sketchpad and a pen and started jotting down endless geometric patterns, combined with many many human eyes. I was just allowing my brain to take the wheel with the drawing, almost moving the pen on autopilot slowly. At some point I went to the toilet as I had been drinking a lot of water and it was making its way through me. I remember feeling a bit anxious about this as I didn't want my housemates to notice my state, and the bathroom felt very creepy to be in. I think I was stuck in the bathroom for about 15 minutes as I was struggling to function properly. I continued with the drawing for around half an hour and then headed back to bed to listen to some relaxing music as I felt a little overwhelmed.+4h00 I don't remember much of what happened between the drawing and now, but I remember this very vividly. I sat on the corner of my bed, and suddenly out of nowhere I just "knew" that I was dead. I was suddenly, 100%, unequivocally convinced that I had died in my bed and I was now experiencing some sort of afterlife. At this point I was still experiencing strong visuals but they were almost in the background of my mind as a feeling of sheer panic set in. My perception of time slowed down to a sheer standstill and I was completely overwhelmed by anxiety. I was shaking and sweating. I looked at myself in the mirror in my room, and it felt like I was looking at someone else. I kind of knew logically that it was me, but it didn't feel like me - it's hard to explain. I felt completely dissociated from my body, and my physical form felt more like a curiosity. At this point I was completely and utterly out of my depth. +4h15 From now on I was just in a state of complete living nightmare. I went and sat in a spot in my room where the heating unit was, leaning against it and covering myself in a blanket. The physically sensation of heat was giving me a very faint kind of grounding, but I still was 100% convinced that I was not alive and that this was me forever now. The physically sensation of heat was giving me a very faint kind of grounding, but I still was 100% convinced that I was not alive and that this was me forever now. +5h30 At this point I had just been sitting against the heater for around 1h (these times are vague estimates as my perception of time was very warped, everything was incredibly slow). I was trying to calm myself down by watching random calming videos on YouTube and eating some snacks. However I was still in a state of complete fear and panic. I cannot even describe this feeling, it is completely incomparable to any level of fear I have ever experienced in my life. I did not fear death, I feared the infinity of potential suffering that could exist. I feared the feeling of experiencing this fear for an eternity, and being unable to ever escape it - I could not even kill myself to end it, as I was already dead. My poor brain had just completely melted into a soup of one pure, raw emotion - fear. My vision was completely tunneled, I was shaking and my legs were spasming. I would imagine my heart rate was high at this point but I did not check. I periodically checked myself in the mirror to check if my pupils were dilated and almost try convince myself that I was high, but I still could not shake the absolute certainty of the feeling that I was dead. In fact, at this point I had the feeling that I had died 1000 times over, and I'm not even sure what that means or where that came from.+9h00 At this point I had been stuck in a cycle of lying in bed, leaning against my heater, and occasionally using my computer to access some relaxing/nature based videos to try and soothe myself. I was urinating very frequently as I had been drinking a very high amount of water as I for some reason felt like it would help me. In hindsight, I may have given myself some mild form of hyponatremia which would have only added to my negative experience. Every time I went to the toilet I was terrified, I found the room so so scary as it was very dark and dingy, and also it did not feel private from my housemates. I had severe anxiety about my housemates finding out about everything when they came into my room and found my body. I think this situation of being alone and feeling worried about others finding out about the trip was a major cause of all the anxiety I experienced during this trip. The visuals were largely over at this point, with just some residual minor disturbances to my vision. This however did not give me any mental relief. I still felt like I was dead and I had been sent to hell. This hell for me was experiencing this feeling of completely overwhelming anxiety forever. The anxiety fed anxiety about being anxious, and formed a vicious cycle that I did not have the mental fortitude to break. +18h Not much changed over the 9hours from the last paragraph. I felt completely overwhelmed by fear and was stuck in a constant loop of the bathroom, my bed, the heater, and trying to sooth myself with various online resources. At this point I had not had any human contact in around 24hours or more and I felt completely insane. I did not feel like this experience would ever end. I researched the duration of LSD (I had done this beforehand too, I was at least always fairly responsible with research) and saw that I was well over the expected duration for intense effects. In hindsight, I was no longer really tripping (except for some minor after effects), but I was in fact trapped in what was at this point essentially a ~14h nonstop panic attack. I was in fact trapped in what was at this point essentially a ~14h nonstop panic attack. I was completely exhausted but completely unable to sleep, my mind was running at 10000km/h and only focused on these things: I was dead, I was insane, I was terrified. Time was passing incredibly slowly as I was in a constant state of fight or flight. It was now very early morning of the next day and I needed to urinate again. This time I decided I simply could not face going into the bathroom so I grabbed a blanket and rolled it up and left the house. It was raining outside, and I walked ~2km to a park (not the nearest park at all, just one I remembered from a few years back). I had intended to sit in the park with the blanket, but when I got there I realised this made no sense. I climbed up a muddy slope into some trees in the park (nearly slipping many times as the ground was wet) and urinated in the bushes. I stood there for maybe 15 more minutes and then headed back home. It took me a while to get back home, and when I did I went straight back to my bedroom. The experience of being outside was a bit nicer as the cold rain was a bit grounding, but at this point I felt so completely disconnected from my body that I felt like I was playing a 3rd person video game. When back in my room, I started to get more worried about how I was feeling and started to think about options.+20h At this point I felt like I had three options: 1) Jump out of my bedroom window and see what happened. It was high enough to kill me, but I was convinced I was already dead, so I wasn't sure what would happen.2) Go outside and call and ambulance. This was terrifying to me though as I was worried that if I was alive they would strap me down in a mental asylum and I would be trapped in this state of mind forever as I would never have the opportunity to end my life, which was far preferable to feeling like this until I died of old age.3) Ask my friends or parents for help.I knew at this point that I was not in a mental place or strong enough to do anything on my own. I had some points where I felt a little more connected with reality, and some less. Pervasive throughout this whole experience was the continuing pure terror. +20h30 I decided that I did not want to jump out of my window as something very primal inside me (I guess my survival instinct) was against this, even though it felt logical at the time to do it. I then decided to throw out all of my illegal substances and go outside and call an ambulance. However when I got outside to call the ambulance, the fear of being imprisoned in an insane asylum forever was too overwhelming and after thinking about it for around half an hour I returned to my bedroom.+21h30 At this point after thinking some more I decided that I had to speak to my housemate. I went out and found him and explained what was happening to him. At the time I had a very strong feeling that he did not really exist, and was just a figment of my imagination, but I figured there was no harm in speaking to him. He was helpful and comforted me but did not really know how to handle the situation. We watched some stuff on TV but I had trouble concentrating due to my mind being consumed by anxiety. I repeatedly asked my housemate to reassure me that he was real, and he did (and reassured me I would be fine), but I still assumed that this is just what the version of him that existed in my own personal hell would say to trick me. I was feeling slightly more relaxed having had some human contact, but still a solid 9/10 on the scale of fear. +24h After sitting my with housemate for a few hours I realised that this was not going to cut it. He tried to convince me to go to hospital, but I was strongly against it due to the aforementioned fears. I instead opted to call my parents, however I had to get him to explain what happened on the phone as I was sobbing too much and felt completely paralyzed and unable to speak. My parents were very concerned and agreed to come and get me and take me home with them.+28h At this point I had survived the journey home with my parents, who were mostly just worried about me at this point. I was finally starting to calm down as I was able to notice more that my trip was coming to an end and that as the anxiety started to fade I started to feel more normal. I eventually finally managed to sleep for a bit.I will end the time based prompts here and talk a bit more about the aftermath. For a few days after this experience, I struggled getting to sleep at all. Any slight thought about the nature of reality would trigger these feelings of me being dead and everything being not real and part of my personal hell again. I felt very dissociated from my body for this period. I had little appetite, and did not have that many bodily sensations in general. These were I guess just the aftermath of the extremely long panic attacks and traumatic experience. Over the course of the next few days, the recurrent panic attacks became less frequent and severe. At first I had to sleep in the same bed as someone else, but after around 3 days I started being able to sleep alone.For the first week or so afterwards I had to have someone in the same building as me at all times or I would immediately have a panic attack (for the first 3-4 days they had to be in the same room). Over the course of the next few weeks I built up confidence being alone in a room and/or building for longer periods of time, until I could spend large portions of the day alone. I went to the doctor's and was prescribed medication to help me sleep and help with anxiety. I also started therapy after a couple of weeks.The trauma of the experience caused me to develop some agoraphobia. As previously mentioned, this started off being a matter of being unable to be alone in any capacity. After a few weeks, it was more just a case of struggling to go outside. After a month I was able to go outside on my own for some period of time, but still struggled with public and busy places. Over the course of the next few months I gained confidence with being able to live more independently. Over the course of the next year, I gradually conquered the agoraphobia and panic attacks. After around 6 months I was capable of living independently and was able to move out. I still had a few lapses where I had to travel back to my parents for a few weeks, but these became less frequent and severe until they stopped occurring about a year after the initial experience. To this day I still suffer with a very mild form of agoraphobia to do with being in places which are very far away from home, or civilisation, but I am confident I will conquer this too with time. I am confident I will conquer this too with time. This experience completely changed my life. It was traumatic and I would never wish it on anyone. I would urge everyone to respect the power of these drugs and make sure they take them only in a safe and good space, and make sure they have a plan for if the trip heads south. In hindsight I have gained some positive things from it - my capacity for handling traumatic experiences is much much higher now, and it forced me to come clean to my parents about my lifelong mental health issues and seek traditional treatment for these. I still have occasionally moments of panic and writing this was very difficult as it caused me to relive some of these memories. The feeling of being alive and reality "existing" gradually came back, but took a long time to be something that didn't bother me. I still have no proof that I am alive, or that anything exists - but I have the philosophy that it does not matter, as I am capable of enjoying whatever my existence may be. If I am stuck in a personal hell, it's not so bad! I have quite a lot of fun and my life is pretty enjoyable these days. For anyone who has experienced anything like this, it does get better - and please be open with those who care about you and let them help you heal. Life can be great, even if this takes a year or so from you.Exp Year: 2021ExpID: 116144Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 21 Published: Mar 9, 2022Views: 4,355    LSD (2) : Alone (16), Therapeutic Intent or Outcome (49), Post Trip Problems (8), Bad Trips (6) DOSE: T+ 0:001.2 goralMushrooms(dried)  T+ 2:30900 ugoralLSD(liquid)  T+ 5:20100 mgoralPharms - Trazodone(pill / tablet)BODY WEIGHT:168 lbThis experience happened barely two days ago, and I’m still looping over the experience in my mind over and over again. Granted, I’m a pretty experienced user with these substances, so I knew what to expect for the most part. However, I was not at all ready for what happened that night. Some of what I’ll be writing is what I remember, and other parts will be what I was told I did. This is the night everything changed for me and I’m still dumbfounded and speechless over it.5:00pm- I was hanging out with a friend of mine and her boyfriend and we decided to have some mushies and just chill in her bed while listening to music. She splits 3.5g of what she has between the three of us, and I decided to slowly eat mine over the course of five minutes. I was in a pretty good headspace that day, all done with spring term and am on my couple week break til summer term begins, so I chose to do this then and there, so I wouldn’t be worrying about schoolwork or stressing over day to day stuff.7:30pm- My friend mentions having a vial of LSD and I asked her if I’m able to have a little bit (I asked for at least 150mcg), she agrees and leaves the room for a second before coming back in and asking me if it’s okay if she doses on a sugarcube, I told her it’s okay. I started to get mild visuals and a body high from the mushies I took, so I thought why not add some lucy to the mix?  She leaves the room for the second time and I’m talking to her boyfriend about concerts we’ve been to, relaxing and having an overall good time in each other’s company.7:32pm- My friend comes back and hands me the dosed sugar cube and I pop it in my mouth and let it dissolve. I’m excited for what’s ahead of me and happy I’m doing something other than sitting at home and mindlessly scrolling through facebook til I pass out. After the cube dissolved, I got the most uneasy feeling that washed over me, but chose to ignore it. I sat on my friend's bed and she decided to give me a foot rub. That uneasy feeling wouldn’t go away.7:55pm- Out of nowhere, the acid hit me like a ton of bricks and was coming on strong. At this point I was having pretty strong visuals, but it was nothing I couldn’t handle. I told my friend I had to go to the bathroom. As I got up, I felt like my visuals were getting more and more intense, but like I said, it was nothing I couldn’t handle. When I went into her bathroom, I felt my breathing getting heavier and heavier, I felt myself becoming more and more on edge. After I was done in the bathroom, I went back into my friend’s room, and cuddled with her and her boyfriend on her bed– it was at this moment my breathing became shallow and I started breathing heavily. My friend asks if I’m okay but I had a hard time talking and answering her question. I stumbled up from her bed and staggered to her bedroom door. Breathing becomes harder and harder. I stumbled out into her living room and started to hear voices. I heard whispers and giggles around me. Breathing becomes harder and harder. I stumbled out into her living room and started to hear voices. I heard whispers and giggles around me. I start to pace around her living room manically, getting scared.8:00pm- My friend comes out into her living room and asks if I’m okay. I told her, “Uh, I don’t know, how much did you give me?”. She started to get nervous, and I asked her again. She tells me, “Umm so, I dosed a cube that I remember I already dosed about three times. So... I might have given you a lot.” My eyes widened as a wave of anxiety washes over me, I ask, “How much is ‘a lot’?” She tells me she thinks she gave me 900mcg or more. My mouth drops and I shake my head at her. She starts to babble and make it all about herself, and at that point I tell her to cut it out. The visuals were getting more and more intense and I’m getting more and more anxious. Mind you, not only have I never had *that* much LSD, I’ve never dosed a bunch in one sitting, I taper up. I started dissociating, paying attention to what she was saying was hard. I looked at my phone and saw my fiance had a super stressful day at work and was getting off work early. I texted her that my friend, who also happens to be my fiance’s other partner, accidentally gave me way more cid than she should have and I want to be picked up from her place. My fiance told me she’s on her way, and at this point, my friend’s boyfriend comes out into the living room and notices me manically pacing around and shaking. He asks how I’m doing and I babbled a little, he took this as a sign I wasn’t doing well and he gets me a glass of ice water. I sat back down on the couch and my friend tried to guilt me for being upset with her for knowingly giving me way more than she should have. I shake my head and start shaking some more. At this point, the voices picked back up and I did my best to keep it cool despite the fact I was getting super scared. The visuals were getting more and more intense, I was *not* having a good time and just wanted this to be over.8:25pm: My fiance comes over and tells me to grab my things so we can leave. My friend and fiance’s other partner tries to tell my fiance to not let me leave– I have no idea why she was doing that, and my fiance tells her to shut up and that she isn’t happy with her. My fiance and I left the apartment. The moment I left the apartment building, the hallway began to morph and change, I got really scared, the visuals were super strong and overwhelming. I told my fiance this and she told me to hold her hand. I stumbled around the hallway, looking like a complete fool.8:40: I don’t remember quite what happened between the time we left, and the time we got to the car, but at this point, I was in the car with my fiance. The visuals kept getting more and more overwhelming, the city at night was completely unrecognizable, everything was morphing and changing, the streets kept changing color and the buildings looked like they were breathing, the colors changed and everything started to freak me out. I then started screaming and crying and wanting to go to the hospital. I screamed loudly and my fiance held my hand and told me to listen to the sound of her voice– this started to calm me down a little bit, she told me sweet nothings and was telling me overall pleasant things on the way to the hospital. Despite the visuals growing more and more intense, I had a feeling that everything was going to be okay when she did that. However, after a few minutes, I started to psych myself out when I heard a voice telling me this is permanent and that I’m going to be in this forever.  8:55pm: We made it to the hospital and by the time we got there, I was too scared to leave the car, but my fiance reassured me that we were going to be okay. She holds my hand and walks with me into the hospital and we go to the front and ask to be seen. I got a bracelet and told my fiance I want to sit down. We sat down in a far corner of the ER, next to a few old people. This waiting room was packed with people and it started to make me panic and feel anxious. Once I sat down, I got this wave of disorientation, I couldn’t recognize anything around me, I didn’t know where I was or who I was at this point, then, the ego death came on. I conked out for at least ten minutes, once I wake, I take my shoes off and start kicking my feet and threw my cane to the ground, everyone was staring at me, and my fiance asked me what I was doing, I didn’t recognize her at first but once I processed what she said, I remembered who she is. I asked her “what are we doing?”, because I couldn’t remember where we were or what we were doing. She tells me we need to wait awhile to be seen, and I started bawling my eyes out and screaming. Every single person stares at me and I cry louder. A couple minutes later, I asked my fiance the same question, evidently I just kept looping and asking her the same question. I then stood up, with my shoes off, and started running around the waiting room with my shoes off, evidently while unintelligibly screaming and crying, flailing my arms around. My fiance stands up and grabs me by one of my arms and asks me to sit down and I guess I yelled no. She sat me down and asked the nurse if we could be seen. I apparently started chewing on my cane and then talking to it. My fiance comes back and tells me that she mentioned I take trazodone and that should be enough to calm me down, so she came back and tried to tell me that, but then I asked her the same thing “Why aren’t they doing anything?!” question. She told me we needed to leave, so I bolted up from my chair, without my shoes on, and ran outside the hospital. When I got outside, a wave of intense fear washes over me, the visuals just wouldn’t stop getting more and more intense, and I didn’t feel like myself. My fiance grabs my arm and walks me to the car. There were people near our car staring at me and I started to freak out and scream at them and my fiance grabbed me by the arm and got me inside the car.9:30: Once we got inside and went on our way back home, I started losing consciousness and blacked out portions of the car ride. My fiance told me I wouldn’t stop screaming and crying that I want to end it all and that I’m going to be permanently like this. I evidently tried jumping out of the car when we were driving over a bridge. My fiance told me I kept talking to myself but it didn't make a bit of sense. I kept repeating the same sentences over and over and freaking out over everything. The moments I remember, I was freaking out about how intense the visuals were and the voices in my head wouldn’t stop. I wanted this to be over, I couldn’t handle this, it was way too intense and strong. I felt angry at that friend for dosing me way too much in one sitting, especially considering she knew she already dosed that sugar cube. At that point, I lost my trust for her.10:20: At this point, we were back home. My fiance goes and looks for my bottle of trazodone to give to me. I kept flailing my arms around and knocking things over. I ended up breaking a prized possession of my fiance’s and she got angry and sternly told me to sit on the bed and wait for her to give me those meds. Evidently I got back up and ran to the bathroom where she was and started yelling loudly that I want to end it all. She told me to sit back down and I ran back to the bed and knocked a bunch of other things down in the process. My memory gets real foggy at this point, but evidently my fiance grabbed me before I nearly jumped out of our window. Mind you, we live in a tall apartment building. I remember her crying and being angry that her other partner negligently gave me that much lucy. She held me down and gave me trazodone and handed me a water bottle and told me to drink water. Evidently I took one sip and threw the bottle across the room. All I remember at this point was that I kept being really loud and breaking shit, I also remember my fiance being super sad and just done with my shit. 11pm: The trazodone started to kick in and I felt more like myself at this point, the visuals were still intense, but not like they were earlier where I couldn’t process anything around me and was overall overwhelmed. I was able to hold a conversation with my fiance and she asked me if I remember anything over the last few hours. I told her not really, just that it was way too intense and overwhelming. She fills me in on pieces I didn’t remember, then... When she mentions almost jumping out the window to end it all, I become really sad. She told me I kept telling her to grab her rifle and shoot me to end it all. She told me she had to grab her handgun from me because I found it and was going to use it. I kept telling her over and over again that I want to be released from this hell.From here on out, I get no sleep whatsoever and am locked to my bed, looping over the events I remember in my head over and over again. I was stuck in my head for hours, listened to music and just kept thinking to myself. My fiance told me she was going to have a word with that partner and leave me alone, since I was not in such a volatile state as earlier. That friend messages me in discord and tries to make me feel bad for her over what happened, but I was not in the mood to talk to her. I couldn’t believe she knowingly gave me that much, especially since she’s an experienced user of this stuff, it just didn’t add up. That was so irresponsible of her, and then tried to make me feel bad? Once night turned into day, I felt different. I didn’t feel like me, I felt like something changed in me and I still was having powerful visuals. The events of that night scarred me and even now, I just don’t feel right. I’ve always known LSD is a powerful substance, but this whole experience taught me that this is not something to play with and you need to be careful. I’ve always wanted to try a “heroic dose” but was definitely not ready for that experience. I hope I start feeling better soon, I just feel like a completely different person now...Exp Year: 2022ExpID: 116472Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: 27 Published: Aug 4, 2022Views: 1,485    LSD (2), Mushrooms (39) : Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Post Trip Problems (8), Train Wrecks & Trip Disasters (7), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE:1 glassoralAlcohol - Beer/Wine(liquid) unknown ugoralLSD(liquid)BODY WEIGHT:110 lbScared and Sleepless Now this was December, my first semester of my sophomore year was over, all my finals and final projects were handed in done and over-with. I was in the mood to celebrate so I decided to go out to the club with my roommate and a few of our friends. I was hanging out in a friends room (who wasn’t joining us on a night out) he had a Visine bottle that was once full of liquid LSD and since then been used up and only some dried remnants were left in the bottle. My friend informed me since the LSD in the bottle had been distilled in alcohol he planned to cut up the bottle and let the remnants dissolve in some wine. I figured ‘what the hell’ I wanted a fun night and hadn’t tripped in a while the bottle of wine was split between 4 people so I figured I wouldn’t be getting much anyway. (So wrong)My roommate and a few of the group I was with knew I was tripping. The rest of the group would simply think I was just drunk. I had my glass of wine and immediately headed out for the night. (10pm) For the beginning of the car ride I felt fine.  I began to feel mostly the buzz of anticipation. Putting my face out the window just to feel the winter cold on my face. As soon as we were in the heart of the city I felt something come on, it wasn’t pleasant at all it was a panic with a lot of nausea. As soon as we were in the heart of the city I felt something come on, it wasn’t pleasant at all it was a panic with a lot of nausea. Towards the end of the ride to the club I had to vomit out the window, a lot of the water I had just drank and some of the wine came up and on to the side of my roommates car. I was more embarrassed than anything and insisted we still go to the club. Upon parking I felt another wave of nausea and sat by the car for a little with one of my friends who I just then informed of my trip. I was getting intense visuals already. The parking lot gravel I was sitting upon was churning like waves. The buildings around us started to wobble around the edges. I was scared because this was the most intense trip I ever experienced and it was only an hour after I had taken it. I sat with my friend and called my boyfriend who wasn’t aware of my tripping but knew I was at the club. I told him how I was, my current situation, my thoughts, and feelings, I could tell he was a little angry I didn’t inform him I would be tripping that night but he put his feelings aside and talked to me for a few minutes just to ease me and make sure I would be alright. After a delightful conversation, we (my friend and I) went to the club me feeling positive and beginning to enjoy my trip. My visuals were still intense and I began to have audio distortions, entering the club which was playing house music. Entering the doorway felt (more sounded) like slipping into a vortex. Getting to the dance floor I found my group we danced under brilliant light affects the people surrounding me resembled holograms my movements seemed fluid and I was laughing and having a great time. After a half an hour or so I began to feel dizzy. So I went outside for some fresh air.I sat outside staring at street lamps which were emitting flexing beams of light and my environment was constantly changing colors. I struck up a conversation with a homeless man asking me for change, he asked me if I was alright I assured him and returned inside the club.The dizziness was still present now accompanied by unimaginably thirst. I went to the bathroom which was a unisex bathroom so putting my head under the water faucet and taking a moment to meditate on the floor was accepted and simply went unnoticed. The feeling of thirst didn’t go away and I felt very uncomfortable. I called my boyfriend again to simply have a conversation to distract me (still on the floor of the bathroom). I was watching the lines of the tiles distort and melt together with the edges of people shoes which I continued to stare at. A few people asked me if I was alright. I assured them all. A man whom at this point in time I am not sure was real or not. A middle aged man with tan skin and grey hair, dressed very professionally and seem like he didn’t belong at this dance club. He asked me if I was alright and I told him I was, and he returned to the bathroom a few times at least it seemed that way because every time I looked up from the floor he was someplace else in the bathroom always looking at me. Once while urinating at a urinal giving a smile which from his face constantly shifting and moving seemed really scary and evil. I didn’t pay much attention to him since I was still on the phone with my boyfriend. But that man scared me and put some of my thoughts in a spindle. I talked to my boyfriend for TWO AND A HALF HOURS on the floor of the bathroom. Then my roommate got me informed me how long I had been sitting there I said my goodbyes to my boyfriend. We left the club I felt much better after leaving holding hands with my friend who stayed with me at the car and I laughed calling her “my sister in the voyage of this galaxy”. We got in the car with only my roommate and ‘my sister’ and myself sprawled out in the back seat. We drove around the city. I was so taken up in the beauty of it I had to call my boyfriend again and tell him about it. We were driving around and my visuals were less apparent my thoughts were miles away. I was very lovey-dovey on the phone with my boyfriend just talking about our past experiences and how even now we were having an experience even if we weren’t together. We returned to my dorm its about 2am now. My roommate has gone to bed since she wasn’t feeling well. I’m pretending to be a dinosaur crawling and roaring around my room. I’m in the whirlwind of needing things to do. I’m drawing in ink watching the smoothness of my brush strokes become jagged edged creatures on paper. I love to write out words and thoughts outside of your head they look prettier. I do this for about an hour after growing restless I change out of club wear and into cozy threads. I’m restless and decide to venture into the basement of my dorm. I decided to do a mural on the wall (which is still there). Mostly spiraled words and phrases. With some galaxies and stars strewn about. At this point I’m getting a bit restless my thoughts are starting to race. I try to distract myself back in my room by watching my favorite anime (One Piece, nothing too plot heavy just some humorous filler episodes). Cuddling with a unicorn stuffed animal my boyfriend gave me named Hexagon. My safe guarding token. It’s about 5am and I am still restless my mind is getting very paranoid. I want to lay down to sleep but that is absolutely impossible. Trying to shut my eyes and settle down is now a terrifying experience. With my eyes closed it seems my thoughts are louder and more fragmented and extremely paranoid. I think about all the things I’ve done wrong and this sense of doom comes over me.I call my boyfriend once more and he calms me down once more but he needs his sleep so I let him be for a few hours. His most helpful advice was to think of something pleasant and dwell on it until it puts me to sleep. I do this eventually... around 9am but before that happens I have the worst leg of my visuals colors and shapes take form but everything I look at ceases to make sense. My window looks like a cartoon duck with a tremendous smile, my mannequin in the corner with scarves on it looks like pyramid head. I try to shut my eyes but it seems like my delusions make me feel completely insane I think the best I can about my love and I eventually fall asleep. I wake up at 11am The following day... Now all my hallucinations are gone. But I am in a whirlwind of dysphoria. I type up a novel of how I feel crying while writing most of it. I’m so paranoid and anxious I can’t sit still. I’ve never felt anything like it before. I try to shower but I never feel clean. I tear at my skin and I try to restrain myself. I brush my hair and tear a ton of it out. I feel a cold sweat no matter how comfortable I am. I’m thirsty and it seems like these awful feelings would never that these thoughts would be with me forever.  In summary it hurt to live. I’m pacing around my apartment and only find solace in expressing my ordeal to others. My roommates my friends and my boyfriend, this communication reminds me I’m not alone. I try to sleep as much as possible and it never happens perhaps a total of 45 minutes of sleep throughout the entire day a few minutes at a time... I’m awake until 1am that night. I go home with my boyfriend. He comforts me and the following day I feel normal again but I was terrified that I never would be. But I learned a lot from that night and I’ll carry that for the rest of my life.Exp Year: 2010ExpID: 94876Gender: Not Specified Age at time of experience: 19 Published: Sep 12, 2022Views: 620    LSD (2) : Various (28), Relationships (44), Health Problems (27), Bad Trips (6), General (1) DOSE: T+ 0:002 hitssublingualLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:001 bowlsmokedCannabis   T+ 0:004 mgoralPharms - Alprazolam(pill / tablet)  T+ 0:00300 mgoralPharms - Quetiapine(pill / tablet)  T+ 8:004 mgoralPharms - Alprazolam(pill / tablet)  T+ 8:00600 mgoralPharms - Quetiapine(pill / tablet)BODY WEIGHT:265 lbThe Last LSD Trip Of My LifeTrip report: 400ug LSD This report is going to be formulated differently than my other trip reports as I lost complete concept of time not very far into this nightmare. This  was not a good experience at all. What you’re about to read is an in-depth explanation of a full blown “unspeakable horrors” bad acid trip. I caution anyone currently tripping on anything at all right now to wait until you’re sober to read this. I wasn’t going to write a report on it at all, but I feel that it’s important for people to understand that when you fool around with LSD, this absolutely has a chance of happening to you. I dosed 400ug LSD at around 11:00am yesterday morning. I immediately smoked a bowl of cannabis after taking the LSD and about a half hour after dosing my roommate woke up, which was nice because I do very much enjoy her company while tripping. As I felt the very familiar LSD come up anxiety, I noticed that it was a bit more pronounced than usual, even bordering on fear as opposed to anxiety. Now, I should note that I’ve had spectacular trips before on this exact same acid at this exact same dosage  so I didn’t feel any trepidation about the dose I took. The come up period was progressing but the anxiety/fear associated with it wasn’t going away. At this point, I decided to tell my roommate I’d taken LSD. Sometimes I tend to avoid telling her when I’m tripping if I can help it, but even barely an hour into this trip I knew I had no choice but to tell her. She took it well, and I started pacing around the house checking out my tapestries, and I took my dog outside. I always have an intense desire to be outside when I take LSD, but my roommate wanted to stay in and watch TV. This created a dilemma: I could either take a towel outside by myself and sit under the lemon tree (the anxiety had progressed to almost all fear at this point) and try to calm down alone, or I could stay inside with my roommate and at least have another person with me. The visuals are majorly picking up at this point, very strong for 400ug. As I said, I lost all conception of time very early on in this trip but if I had to guess I’d say about three hours was when it became downright terrifying. Usually, no matter how fucked up I am on any drug, I’m capable of telling myself “Mr. T, you’ve taken a drug. That’s why you feel like this, and eventually it will wear off.” Yesterday, that part of my brain was broken. I remembered I’d taken LSD, but the idea that I wasn’t going to feel this mix of terror and restlessness and desire to jump out of my own skin forever just didn’t compute. As a result, I started to genuinely believe that the trip was never going to end and that I was going to be stuck feeling this physical restlessness and raw terror for the rest of my life. I sat down on my roommate’s bed, grabbed her as hard as I could, and just started shaking and sobbing uncontrollably. I remember looking at her and saying “I put two little paper squares under my tongue, how the fuck is this happening?” I also required constant (almost to the minute) reassurance that I was, in fact, going to stop tripping eventually and be fine. I didn’t believe it, though. I remember promising myself that I would commit suicide if I was right and these feelings really were permanent. The visuals were the most intense I’ve ever experienced at 400ug, with twisting tendrils enveloping pretty much everything I looked at. I kept getting up to go outside for like two or three minutes, just in some vein hope that the outdoors would calm the terror I was feeling, but when it proved useless I’d come back inside and just keep holding my roommate and crying. At this point, there are two possible options in my head. I can call 911 and hopefully be brought down in a hospital setting, or I can take Xanax and Seroquel until this shit fucking stops. The first two Xanax bars did absolutely nothing, and I followed it up with 300mg Seroquel (I’m in the process of getting off Seroquel but I am keeping some extras in case of emergencies like this). I could feel the physical sensation of my body becoming relaxed and tired due to the pill combo, but it did NOTHING for my head, which by this point is operating beyond comprehension. There’s no possible way I can use words to explain the way I thought and felt at this period in time. Terrified, hopeless, overwhelmed, and psychotic don’t even begin to cover it. I gladly would have accepted death to make it stop, though. I took two more Xanax bars (bringing my total to 8mg Xanax) and 600mg more Seroquel (bringing my total to 900mg Seroquel). Once that second round of pills kicked in, I slowly but surely started to come back to reality. For the first time in hours, I realized that I’d taken a drug and that the effects were not going to be permanent. I was still in a state of terror, but it became less pronounced as the massive cocktail of sedatives I took began to kick in. About an hour and a half after the second dose of tranquilizers, I was able to think somewhat clearly and rationally again. I now knew that I was going to be fine, and that I’d simply taken too much LSD and it threw me for a hell of a loop. About two to two and a half hours after the second round of tranquilizers, I was tired and calm enough to sleep. I fell asleep at around 9:30-10:00pm and slept for 14 straight hours. Post trip thoughts: I am NEVER ever taking LSD again, at least not by itself. It can be a fun add-on to combos at very low doses for me (absolute max 200ug) but never again in my life will I take just LSD by itself for a trip. I’ve never had a bad trip on anything other than LSD (with the exception of one shrooms trip where I ate WAY too much by accident and I don’t count that because it was my own fault) and I see no need to continue baiting the beast by taking it again. Phenethylamines and tryptamines only going forward. Also, thank fucking god for my roommate. We’re very close, to the point of being family, but when it comes down to it she really is just my roommate. She did NOT need to spend her entire day trip sitting someone who was having the bad acid trip to end all bad acid trips. She could’ve just told me it was my issue and to deal with it myself, but she didn’t. She’s the real hero here, as a trip to the hospital would’ve been an absolute guarantee if I hadn’t had her there. I wrote this for the newcomer. 400ug is a decent sized dose of LSD but not heroic by any means. I’d also taken this dose before with spectacular results. LSD is unpredictable. You should always use the utmost care when taking it, make sure you’re in a safe place with a safe potential trip sitter, and NEVER think you’re above having a really fucking terrifying trip. I’ll also note that I’m 100% sure the LSD I took was real LSD and dosed correctly, and that this wasn’t a case of being laced or taking the wrong thing by mistake. Overall experience: -10/10, this was quite literally the scariest experience of my entire life and I will never ever put myself in a position to repeat it. The amount of fear and terror present during those 8-12 hours were palpable and overwhelming, and it took a small army of tranquilizers to bring me back. Be safe, people. Don’t overtake LSD and remember that you don’t really take it, it takes you.

I got really good energy from them even though I didn't know them too well, so I was expecting to have a great time. At around 3:30 PM, I went to the porta-potties to drop my 110 ug tab. For reference, I had done acid only once before, in my room while voice chatting with an experienced tripper, so my tolerance is low. It was a philosophical experience and I got very in my head, but it was still enjoyable. I wanted to try it at a festival because I'd heard of people having lots of fun, plus I knew I was going to love the music and the vibes of the fest. At about 4:00-4:30, I was feeling the come up while listening to a set. The world was getting wavy and wobbly, in standard LSD fashion. I was having the time of my life, just running around and dancing in between sets. I got my first pash and ate some unappetizing snacks from a vendor. I went on the ferris wheel with one of my group mates, which was fucking amazing. This good energy went on for about 3.5 hours.This was about the time I started experiencing negative symptoms. I was at the main stage just enjoying the music (one of the artists I was looking most forward to). Earlier, I randomly started thinking about e-mailing one of my professors whose class I am behind in, and it started stressing me out, so I'm at fault for leading my trip in a bad direction. I took a couple hits from my group mate's joint because I thought it may calm me down, but boy was I WRONG.At this point I started feeling a bit paranoid, and people’s faces around me were distorting at a rapid rate. Thankfully I realized I was heading into bad trip territory and I told a member of the group. As soon as I said “I think I’m having a bad trip,” everything went into chaos. His face exploded across my field of vision and everything slowed down. I could hear my group members’ voices echoing around me in slow motion, and even though I turned around, it took a few seconds for me to see their faces. It was very odd, pretty much a state of limbo. The crowd in front of me seemed to freeze, like I was stuck in that point of time, but I could occasionally turn around and time would start moving again, albeit slower. They had pulled me away from the stage so I was standing farther back, but I could still see the lights and hear the music pretty well, which would help me later on in the trip. Time was going in loops, and I could see the people weaving in and out of my vision at points but everything still looked eerily the same. I was feeling really badly for putting a downer on my group’s night, which heightened the bad feelings. I was hyperfixating on one of my insecurities— the fact that I feel like I always am trying to make things about myself (even though I’m actively trying to avoid doing this). I told the group I was sorry for messing up their night and they were saying shit like “this is our night, too,” and “as soon as she said she was having a bad trip…” and “this is what I get for paying $150?” It just made me feel terrible.At some points during the experience peoples’ faces were expanding and turning gray and every time I tried to go closer someone or some force was pulling me back, likewise if I tried to move backwards, I was being turned back around toward the stage by the people around me. Occasionally I would talk to them and apologize for ruining their nights. Eventually (I had lost total perception of time at this point and my phone was in my locker, so I can’t say when) I realized there was some sort of emergency service looking after me, some guys dancing along with me and a small ring of medical professionals surrounding me. I think they were choreographing something because people kept dancing and walking around my field of vision, and I could hear some guys saying “what are we supposed to be doing again?” and someone was commenting, “yeah people forget you’re on it for like 12 hours and it can go wrong” so these people must have been informed about what was going on. This helped me a bit, and I started being able to control my experience a bit more, and I started sort of playing with the visual distortions, although sometimes things would go out of control. I could still hear the music and I was just vibing to it and dancing in place, so I knew I had some semblance of control.I was having a bad trip, but I still somehow ended up having a good time just experiencing the visual distortions. It was pretty scary, but I think I was able to mostly turn it around at the end. The bad trip mostly was over by the time the festival was over, around 11 PM; it was as if the last set had ended it. I walked back to my locker and got my phone and backpack and headed back to the metro to be picked up by my ride. I was following some cool people and offered one of the dudes a pash. I don’t think I’m ever going to combine weed and acid again.Exp Year: 2022ExpID: 116351Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 20 Published: Oct 24, 2022Views: 262    Cannabis (1), LSD (2) : Festival / Lg. Crowd (24), Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3) DOSE:1 hitsublingualLSD(blotter / tab)BODY WEIGHT:115 lbJust over 6 weeks ago, I had the most life changing experience of my life. It was around 9pm, and my roommate was out with friends; meaning I had the place to myself. I had taken LSD a handful of times (with and without others/sitters) and had incredibly positive experiences and thought that tonight would be no different. Let me preface that I am an intensely strong believer in the idea of intentions for tripping. Basically, if you take a substance with specific intentions, your trip will reflect those intentions. It's kind of like set and setting but a little different.Anyways, I had recently had a strong psychological trip a month prior and wanted to see more. I wanted to seek out the truths of consciousness and the universe. So with my intentions clear, I took the blotter paper and stuck it underneath my tongue, waiting for the effects to kick in. I always clean my apartment and fast before a trip, for anyone curious.T+30 minutes after taking the acid, I was sitting in a phone call with a friend and just talking. It started as small stomach aches and tightness of the skin. Gradually, it felt as if I could feel all my organs working inside of me. It started as small stomach aches and tightness of the skin. Gradually, it felt as if I could feel all my organs working inside of me. I could feel my stomach churning and contracting. I decided I should lay down and just try to relax. So, I hung up the phone and did just that, laying on my bed.The discomfort only grew in intensity. I was practically wailing in pain from the feeling of my body getting tighter and tighter, like my skin was getting stretched across my bones. The thought had crossed my mind that I had taken LSA or NBOME, as LSD had never caused feelings this uncomfortable before. I called someone more experienced with drugs than myself; a close friend at the time. I explained the situation and the pains. He assured me it was just acid, and told me to calm down, the normal stuff. Finally he said, "Just lay down and try to enjoy your visuals." I was going to say I didn't have any visuals, when I looked up at my room. My eyes practically shot open when I admired the extensive fractalizations covering my room. The lights made my room look like a stellar supernova of colors and textures layered over my room. I watched in awe for a few minutes before the trip turned sinister.With each breath I took, it felt like the world was getting smaller and smaller. My anxiety was steadily growing, and I was trying to explain my thoughts to my friend. He continued the "you're just high" lines no matter what I said. The more and more we talked, the more it felt like he wasn't even real, and that I was experiencing a charade or practical joke; and I was the punch line. This feeling persisted, and soon I was overcome by the idea that something was very very wrong, out of place, or that something horrible was about to happen. I relayed this to my friend, who unsurprisingly said "you're just high" and this was the beginning of a very very dangerous thought loop I got caught in. "S" I said "You need to be absolutely deadly serious with me right now." I said it like I was about to die, because it felt like I was. "If you were part of some cosmic facade, and this life wasn't real, and you were in on it, would you tell me?" He reacted somewhat neutrally. "Idk, man. You're just high and need to chill out." He said. I maintained my composure as best as I could, under the circumstances I believed this was true. I reiterated the severity of my seriousness. "S, if you are lying or fucking with me right now, I swear I will steal a car, take my gun and drive to your house to kill you." I said.Without much hesitation, "I'm not fucking with you, you're just high." He said, and this did me in. After those words, I was convinced of my suspicions, and felt as though I was just the universe's laughing stock. Like my whole life was a joke and everyone I interacted with on a day to day basis was in on it, and knew all my thoughts at all times, every second I was alive. It felt like everyone in the world was watching me and laughing at me through this screen I couldn't see, and it sent me into this crazed state of crying and trying to just turn off the high. I told myself I just need to go to sleep and that when I wake up everything would go back to normal. I got ready to do just that when the intrusive thoughts came. I started to question if anything at all was real, and a voice inside my head just kept replaying the sound of my own distorted voice saying "is this real?" In a mocking tone inside my head. Horrible imagery soon followed. Every time I looked in my room, or out into the hall, I imagined a monster or a demon would scoop me up and take me away and do horrible things like torture or rape me. It felt like the acid was alive and conscious, and was telling me that I am stuck with it forever. I was scared the nightmare wouldn't end, and I was never going to be sober again. To try and escape my thoughts, I walked out into the hallway and barged into my roommate's room. He had come back home and was sleeping during my fiasco. When I barged in, I woke him up and he said I was just speaking garbled nonsense. Like everything was English but all my words were messed up, and I looked half cognizant. He asked if I had taken any drugs, of course in my delirium I admitted yes, and he suggested I lay in bed with him and just try to calm down and sleep it off. I remember getting in the bed and my body just freezing. I couldn't talk, move, I could barely think. It felt like I was paralyzed. I laid there and the thoughts were out of my control. It felt as though my memory was getting worse and worse, like my thoughts were not my own anymore and new memories were being implanted into my brain. My memories got further and further away, until it felt like all that I could remember is that I am being toyed with by a god; and the god was acid. The acid made it so I couldn't remember my thoughts from a second ago, and so I just kept thinking the same thing over and over. I kept asking myself in my head what's happening, what's happening. I was told by my roommate I just kept mumbling garbage the whole night, occasionally saying my name.This I remember, as I was scared that if I didn't keep saying my name I wouldn't remember it anymore. This went on for hours, as the next thing I can recall is it finally beginning to settle down around 5am. I looked at the time on my phone and decided I can finally just sleep it off. Big mistake.Once asleep, after the ordeal I was told I urinated 3 times in the bed while completely unconscious and unresponsive. I went back to saying things in my sleep, horrible things I would never say out loud like "Go get the gun and shoot me in the head, it will make me feel much better" and "fuck me good you stupid n word" and "being god feels horrible" without ever responding to my roommate, who had been awakened by my verbalizations of visions. During this time I kept seeing myself die and get plopped back into a separate world that looked identical to my own, like I had just killed myself and my consciousness was transferring to a new vessel. I saw visions of myself as a baby in open fields from eons ago before humans. Beyond this, I got incredibly intense geometric imagery. One example I remember very clearly was this tesseract shaped die with a myriad of colors covering it being thrown down into a black pit and a colored trail whispering down behind it, almost painting the void. This moment felt like my life was the tesseract and I was throwing it away. The next thing I remember is shooting awake and leaning upright like I had just woken up from a nightmare. I was now laying on the floor. My roommate had moved me but at the time I was unaware. I looked around with the most worrisome and fearful expression. "Where am I?" Of course I recognized that I was still at home with my roommate but something was off. My eyes were absolutely filled with sparkling colors of light that painted my periphery. Everything and everyone had exaggerated features, including myself. I could see long patches of hair extending out from my normally smooth skin. My skin was taught around my bones in my hands. The worst feeling I had was this perpetual feeling of people touching me. It felt like people were groping and grabbing me but I couldn't see or move them. The feeling intensified and persisted and snaked over my whole body. I stood up and waved my hands all around myself like I was swiping feelers away. "Stop touching me" I said, and repeated over and over. This feeling never stopped, and I looked at my roommate who was sitting down across from me. "What's going on…" I said to him, and he looked at me very intently. "You're on Acid, it's a psychoactive substance that you took." The calmness in his voice and sinister tone was only reinforcing the fact that this game I had been playing was still going on. I started freaking out more and more, touching the walls around me and hyperventilating. One of the only more intense feelings than the touching was this psychological attack I was undergoing. Doing anything at all inside my head made me believe the acid knew what I was going to do, and planned for it, and that the decisions I said yes to in this reality affected worlds where I was but couldn't see, and in those worlds someone was taking advantage of my body without me knowing, and that the touching was me feeling those realities. I was convinced all of it was true and I had finally figured it out. So I tried my best not to think at all and to just do things as randomly as possible to throw off the acid in my head. This backfired, as every decision I tried to make made me believe that I really didn't have a choice and that the acid knew everything without exceptions every decision I tried to make made me believe that I really didn't have a choice and that the acid knew everything without exceptions.My roommate was just about done with my horrible trip and psychotic behavior, so he said to leave the room but I resisted, as an effort to spite the acid controlling him. He forced me out after I had started wrecking the room even more, and I was now in the living room. The touching just never ended, and eventually I was in for a rude awakening.5 minutes passed and a pair of paramedics walked through my front door, along with some firefighters. They stepped inside and I cowered away from them. My roommate stepped outside of his room and told me he had called them to see if they could fix me. Of course, in my head, I thought that these people were going to make this reality like the others I was feeling, that they were all going to grab me and take me away to a place that no one would hear me scream and take turns defiling my body. Under that impression, I ran to the kitchen and took an empty liquor bottle in one hand as a weapon to defend myself. Everyone exasperatedly yelled at me to drop the bottle. At first I hesitated, but eventually set it down. Quickly they rushed me and grabbed me, holding my hands over my head and pushing me into a gurney where they strapped and bound me. I was kicking, screaming and crying for help the entire time, thinking this horrible nightmare was just starting. They wheeled me into an ambulance and shut the doors. I cried and cried and begged them to let me go but insisted "this was for my own good." They sat in the back with me as I looked for a way free. The female paramedic offered me a stuffed animal exactly like one in my room and it only kept me in my craze. Things all around me continued to change as I looked. ID's on each officer had slight variations each time I looked, names would change, my body would change, like I was just being thrown into a slightly different reality every second. I had arrived at the hospital and had some time to calm down, decompress and rationalize what I had been experiencing. Only then did I realize what I had done. I was kicking and screaming about invisible people and crying about things that didn't exist, acting like a deranged psycho. The doctors gave me anti-anxiety medication and it solidified my comedown. Once I felt mostly back to normal I was checked out with my roommate and sent back home.As I said before, this was about 6 weeks ago. Everyday since this experience I have had horrible anxiety, ego dissolution, panic and anxiety attacks, mental breakdowns and slight physical symptoms similar to the touching phenomenon from the trip. I have been struggling with my normal life, staying social and keeping up with my job; it has not been easy.This trip really messed up my life and the worst part is I still get horribly intense cravings to go back to being high. The feeling that reality is fake and that everyone knows everything about me still haunts me in my daily life. I am going to do my best to stay away from acid as long as I can, but I'm scared my borderline addiction to psychedelic worlds outside of my perception will convince me that being sober is just a facade and that getting high on acid will help me find the truth, only to dive me deeper into this void of insanity. Exp Year: 2022ExpID: 116764Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 21 Published: Nov 2, 2022Views: 472    LSD (2) : Guides / Sitters (39), Post Trip Problems (8), Bad Trips (6), Alone (16) DOSE:300 - 400 ugoralLSDBODY WEIGHT:65 kgLSD and Self BettermentMy experience with LSD has had a profound impact on my life, in the most brilliant and terrifying ways. This story is about the use and abuse of LSD in the pursuit of fixing my faults. Not a cautionary tale for the typical user.A brief history of my experience with LSD:I first took LSD when I was 14, I couldn’t tell you the dose, I just did it… and it was fantastic. Throughout my teenage years and into my 20’s I must have used LSD around 300 times and I loved every second of it. Every jittery come-up, every intriguing thought, every display of visual patterns indescribable to another. I even enjoyed the less tasteful side of LSD, I would often take doses more than 500ug and stare into a mirror in a dimly lit room, climb tall industrial buildings while feeling like the ladder was melting in my hands, nothing seemed to faze me. I had firmly decided that I was not capable of having a ‘bad trip’. I had not realised this at the time, but I had adopted these attitudes and proclivities because it made me feel superior to those who could not do what I did, and nobody I knew could do what I did. On the day of my 21st  birthday, I attempted to take 2100ug of the course of the night (over roughly 4 hours), just because I could. I reached 1800ug before blacking out on the couch. As much as the experience of a 1800ug trip might interest some of you, it was not altogether that interesting. In my experience, the dosage may dictate the level of intoxication, but it is the environment which truly matters. Truth is, I was using LSD to try to fix my faults and insecurities. I hope I have painted a fair representation of myself, I was as many of us are, a young insecure person with a big ego.My penultimate trip:The second to last time I have taken LSD was at the age of 22, I was completely unaware that this night would change the trajectory of my life forever. To briefly cover the mechanics of this experience, I took about 300-400ug of LSD in a 30-minute period, had little to no alcohol or other drugs, and was at a house party with about 50 people in attendance. I was currently going through a very difficult time with my partner of 4 years, I had made a series of mistakes. This might sound like the perfect storm, but to me, this was just another trip. Anyway, after the LSD started to take effect, I was very chatty with everyone, not uncommon. One girl at the party told us a story about local gang members recruiting young kids outside the primary school she was volunteering at. This sparked all the guys to start boasting about gang members they knew or situations they had been in. Usually, this would have been me as well, but not this time. I was intensely fixated on how upset this girl was about what she was describing. I could feel her distress as if her experiences were my own, I had never felt this much empathy before in my life. As this feeling of empathy overwhelmed me I had another very strange feeling that ‘everything was going to be all right’, quite literally everything, it’s hard to describe but I do believe if I was a religious person I may have well described this feeling as being touched by God. This feeling overwhelmed me and I walked out the front gate of the house and began to spin with my arms wide open, I felt like I was being pulled outside and I couldn’t stop spinning. I was yelling ‘It’s all going to be OK!’ and ‘You all have no idea how wonderful life is’ and other bits of nonsense. Evidently, it was at this point my grip on reality was gone. I felt like I was completely aware of an infinitely complex series of connections which governed every action and reaction in the universe. I kept spinning and eventually, everything went black.Next thing I know I can hear voices above me, but everything is still black. I hear them say ‘Mate, are you ok?’ I did not respond, ‘Hey man are you ok, really?’. I open my eyes and see three people standing over me, I look at myself and see I’m lying in the gutter, and I’m cut up and bloody, although I don’t feel any pain. I got to my feet and said ‘yes I’m fine’ very quickly and took off down the street to my car. From here, my experience of the world was better described as a delirium than a trip. I had moments where I felt that everything was going to be ok, like the true nature of the universe was kind and consciousness was a blessing. I had moments where I believed I was saying one last goodbye to those I loved before subjecting myself to a future of eternal torture. I felt every different emotion, one at a time, on a repeating loop which I could not control. I felt every different emotion, one at a time, on a repeating loop which I could not control. Every unpleasant emotion I felt I would uncontrollably work my way down the string of thoughts as to why I felt what I was feeling, and every time the same ending was waiting, it was death. If you are inclined such as I am to believe in Darwinian natural selection, this conclusion seems rather obvious. It had dawned on me that emotions serve as a tool to avoid death. Feel scared when standing next to a cliff? Good, you’ll be less likely to die if you don’t stand there. Feel happy around other people? Good, cooperation and bonding increase the chance you will survive. In the modern world some of these reactions are perhaps a bit redundant, but we are not yet adapted for the environment in which we live. After what felt like an eternity, but was closer to 2 hours, I came out of this delirium. I went from ‘I have the keys to the universe’ to stone cold sober in the snap of a finger. I was so scared I was going to die or reality itself was going to end, that I just got in my truck and very carefully drove home and went to bed, hoping it all would just go away if I slept.My final trip:About two months later I stupidly took LSD again, maybe 200ug. Everything was fine for the first few hours, then boom, I black out and wake up on the ground and here we are again, the most paralysing terrible fear imaginable just for me to enjoy. My friend offers to take me inside but I don’t trust him, I feel like I’m about to die. After a few second I get a grip just long enough to say yes and he helps me up and inside. As we walk in, I’m terrified, imagining all the ways I could die on this walk, or ways he could kill me. I get inside and try to calm down. It doesn’t work. I’m having the same feelings as the last trip, but this time it’s worse. Everything feels connected and I think I’m going to die. To describe this feeling, imagine this. You’re hanging off a cliff, you’re holding on to the hand of the person you love the most. Imagine if they intentionally let you go, and the feeling you would have as soon as you realise what they did and what is going to happen to you. Fear, betrayal, sadness, all on maximum volume and all at once. Anyway, this went on for maybe two hours again then just like last time, I go from full-blown delirium to sober in a couple seconds. The consequences of my actions:After my final trip, the thought pattern I described didn’t go away like it had the previous time. It followed me 24 hours a day. It was not usually as intense as feelings of impending death, but sometimes it was. My reality was destroyed. I would sometimes feel like the world around me was nothing but a dream I had conjured up to forget the fact I was the only being in existence. Imagine existing forever and alone, no fate could be worse. I was completely out of touch with reality. After ~9 months of living like this I had my eureka moment, I was having a rather serious panic attack where I was convinced if I went to my window, opened my curtains and looked to the sky I would see an asteroid which would end life on earth (ridiculous I know, but when you really believe it’s very compelling). I had a moment of realisation of how much all this was affecting my girlfriend and decided enough was enough. Two possibilities existed for me.1.	I’m right and reality is a lie created to torture me, if so, then I can’t avoid my fate so let’s get it over with.2.	I’m wrong and my disconnect with reality is meaningless and is only hurting the person I love.So, I go to the window, push through all the paralysing fear and look out, and nothing happens. So there it was, I had faced what I had truly believed to be death and spat in its face. I thought all my problems were solved and I would become the person I dreamed of I thought all my problems were solved and I would become the person I dreamed of, free from all anxieties and negative proclivities. I had conquered death, everything else would be easy. This is not what happened. This moment did change my life, in that I become reconnected with reality after this. Three years later and I still sometimes fall into the pattern of thinking in which reality is a lie. It doesn’t really bother me anymore. I am not yet the person I want to be, I still have my anxieties and my short comings. I am still ignorant, and I am still arrogant, and it still impacts my relationships with people. But I finally can get over myself and recognise these flaws, I finally can improve as a person. The past three years of my life have been torturous but have undeniably been the best years of my life. At the time of my penultimate trip, I was working a low-end job, had all but ruined my relationship, used a variety of hard drugs 3+ times a week and had no life prospects. Now I am married, spend my time sober, work out and am close to completing a university (college) degree. I owe this change to a variety of influences but I know that I would not have listened to these influences if I had not had this experience.  Was it worth it:Yes it was worth it, but I would not wish this experience on anyone. I had no trajectory in life and to be honest I had nothing to lose. If this process had killed me it wouldn’t have been a loss to the world, my ego and laziness would have inhibited me from ever doing anything more than mindlessly consume, I would have achieved nothing in my life. The only reason I’m out the other end of this experience is that I accepted that harsh fact.Consciousness has the amazing ability to torture itself for seemingly no reason, accepting there is a reason is the first step to overcoming it.Exp Year: 2019ExpID: 116665Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 22 Published: Nov 15, 2022Views: 439    LSD (2) : Large Group (10+) (19), Post Trip Problems (8), Bad Trips (6), Retrospective / Summary (11) DOSE: T+ 0:001 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 0:302 hitssmokedCannabis   T+ 0:00100 mgoralPharms - Quetiapine   T+ 0:001.5 mgoralPharms - Alprazolam   T+ 0:00  repeatedsmokedCannabis BODY WEIGHT:199 lbPsychotic Bad Trip on Low Dose by Experienced UserI have taken LSD many times in my life. I used to be addicted to xanax and heroin, but in the past 4 years I have turned my life around and maintained a healthy life via support groups, rehab, and changing my lifestyle. The past couple of times I took LSD it was an extremely traumatic experience. I was taking 4+ 200ug tabs at a time, and after 2 bad trips in a row I hadn't touched the substance since. My trips at the time were centered around how I was ruining my life with drugs, devoid of any of the beauty and connectedness one should feel on LSD.Now, 4 years later, I decided I wanted to try again because I am in a better state of mind and my life is better. My GF of 2 years wants to take some with me, and I am excited to lead her on this journey as the experienced one. We prepare properly, I load up some cool videos and music. I am in a good headspace. It is a low dose, I am ready to see some cool trippy colors, some warping, feel closer to my girlfriend, feel closer to the universe.We dose 1 tab of 105ug LSD each from a trusted and well reviewed source at our friends house and go home. At 30 minutes, I notice the first effects and a soft smile comes to my face. I am eating some beef and rice as it begins to kick in, and we are watching a space documentary. As the effects become stronger, my grin widens a bit and I say "lets get the bowl out" - so I grab our weed and begin to break it down, ready to go deeper.This was probably a mistake. I am prone to paranoia on weed sometimes, and looking back this was probably a very bad idea. I wasnt planning on smoking, but I felt great and I was ready to go deeper. We smoked about 2 hits a piece and I said we should go for a walk. My GF still says shes not sure if she feels it, I laugh because I notice the onset happening and I know she is just experiencing some delusions of sobriety. I decide the walk is the best way to slip into the mood.As we walk down the stairs of our apartment, I notice the effects are much stronger than I thought. We have to walk down 3 flights, but I felt like we walked down 6 flights. We made it about 100 yards from our apartment before I got 'the fear' (I call it this from the book by Hunter S. Thompson).I tell my GF we need to get back to the house ASAP. We get back inside, I run to my room and throw 100mg of seroquel inside of my mouth. This freaks my GF out. Let me try to explain what was going on from my eyes:I had fucked up. I took this drug that I wasnt supposed to take, I forgot it made the true reality come out, the sick and twisted one where I am the victim of some grand intradimensional plot. My life has been set up, I was a victim of some type of MK ultra experiment designed to make me lose my mind on drugs and be an example to others so they dont go through the same. I had completely forgotten I had taken a drug. I had no idea I was tripping. I was seeing fractals EVERYWHERE, the floor was warping into itself, full on 3d geometry. I was in a state of panic, and my poor girlfriend I was supposed to be the responsible one.She kept reminding me we were okay. I did not feel okay. I kept saying "I dont remember I dont remember". The drugs were ruining my life again. I had some xanax in case things got nasty and I took it. I felt like I was loosing control, that I had to go back to rehab. For context, my life was going great. I am successful at work, and I have not had any drug problems lately. But I was just thrown back into this state of existence I was in the last few times I tripped.It felt so much stronger than just 105ug for me, but from what my GF told me the next day, hers sounded exactly like it should have.Eventually, my GF convinces me its okay to call our friend A (I kept thinking she was a narcotics agent) to get her to come over. As soon as A came over, I got better. She was relating to what I was going through "oh I remember when I was tripping blah blah" ... it all made sense now.  FUCK. What the hell? I was just tripping. OH..... I took acid and I wanted this. What the fuck? I started laughing. ... it all made sense now.  FUCK. What the hell? I was just tripping. OH..... I took acid and I wanted this. What the fuck? I started laughing. I apologized profusely and kept laughing. My psychosis was over, I finally realized I was just on a drug and everything was okay.I was able to enjoy the rest of the trip. I feel so foolish for freaking out. I will definitely try again with these tabs in a few weeks..  I will take 1-2mg xanax beforehand. I have way too much trauma from drugs and psychedelics...For the rest of the night we were smoking weed, my GF and I had great sex. I was just so absolutely goddamn flipped off that 105ug tab... I dont know why it was so strong. That was the lowest dose I have ever taken and had full on fractal geometry, ego death, and horrible paranoia.Exp Year: 2023ExpID: 116951Gender: Male Age at time of experience: 27 Published: Jan 15, 2023Views: 203    LSD (2), Cannabis (1), Pharms - Quetiapine (273), Pharms - Alprazolam (98) : Combinations (3), Bad Trips (6), Small Group (2-9) (17) DOSE: T+ 0:001 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 1:001 hitoralLSD(blotter / tab)  T+ 3:301 tabletoralMDMA   T+ 3:502 hitssmokedCannabis BODY WEIGHT:132 lbIs This Ego Death That I ExperiencedAround 5:45, my friend and I took our first single hit of stamps, we then waited an hour exactly to take our second one. The first 3-4 hours was nothing but pure bliss and laughter, the physical, mental, visual high was overwhelming but no fear at all, actually felt invincible, laying on the bed, in the room in total darkness, listening to trance music. I can see a tribal village dancing on the walls, nothing but colors changing and merging. It was so beautiful, at one point I looked at my friends valentines day card her boyfriend had given her and it had a rose on it, it started to open n I saw stars flying, streaking thru it, as if I was seeing space, flying thru it within this flower. I began to cry hard but it was pure joy. I loved the place I was in so much, to the point where I would tell my friend, ”..why would anyone want to keep us away from here.?..’ we felt like little girls, like innocent children playing our imaginary world we felt like little girls, like innocent children playing our imaginary world, even Britney Spears sounded n felt amazing.. LolAt 9:15 we took a molly. As soon as it hit us 20 mins later, we were on a complete other level, so happy beyond explanation.  My friend rolled up a blunt a marijuana n …’I said sure y not’…big mistake…I took two good hits, n my friend told me she wanted to blow me up with glowsticks or glowballs we  we had. She had mentioned that when she did it for her bf when they tripped together, he called her Shiva because it looked like she had eight arms…When she said ”youre going to call me Shiva”... The room turned dark red n her whole persona turned evil,  villain like. When she went to go turn off the light, something told me’ if she turns off that light, you're going to die…’ I knew exactly what was happening, I got up from the bed n panicked ”I'm having a bad trip!” my mind kept telling me "y did you smoke, you know you can't smoke" my mind kept telling me "y did you smoke, you know you can't smoke" but because I was being selfish and just wanted to intensify my trip. It did some stupid shit... She looked at me with an evil look in her eyes, “what? Y? Whats wrong?” in a cynical way. I felt my soul sink to my feet, and seep thru my toes into the ground. I felt hopeless, helpless, my body began feel empty,  it was pure fear and regret and denial.  I felt like this was my judgement, this was my time to repent and ask for forgiveness because I'm about to die.  The song playing in the back at that time,  “Love rain down” by George Acosta, became an eery song .. “ let your love rain on me”…..it was spiritual and scary as hell. I hunched over asking god “no no please!!”, I stood up and began to pray “please god please no I'm sorry, I'm sorry forgive me”. Images of my daughter came and, I kept saying to myself “I cant leave her, I cant leave her behind..”   I stood up but put my hands on my face and said “I'm immortal!”, my friend knew what was up when I yelled it, grabbed me by arms telling me that I'm a good person and not to be afraid, and that she loves me, she grabbed me and held me close. It felt as is by hugging me,  I was being forgiven of my “sins”. I then looked up at her face and asked her to open the door, and she said “why...are you sure?…” fearing I was going to do something crazy like or hurt someone who at the house. But my mind told me,” if she doesn’t open that door, you're going to die”…as if whatever higher power is out there, used her image, to be the one to set my fate. It was my judgement day. This was it, this moment if she opened the door.I told her “I promise I wont do anything just please open the door.” she cautiously opened the door, and as soon as I stepped foot out of the room, I felt liberation, everything turned white, my friend said I ran out the room like a bat out of hell. I ran out the front door, I went to the front patio and everything was still, time had stopped, and I sat down like wtf just happened... And felt as if I was set free, like as if I for now on have the privilege to come back this place, now that I have a whole new respect for it (the LSD),  I wasn’t scared of doing it, just had a new view of it, respect...I will never see life the same, it made my friend and I realize that nothing else matters at the end, only that you’ve done good in your life, and don’t take it or anyone for granted, and to be around people who care about you and trust. My whole aspect on life and people is totally turned around. When I looked this up, and read about ego death…I wanted to cry as I read what would happen. I do believe this what I experienced, but I'm glad I did.Exp Year: 2012ExpID: 96891Gender: Female Age at time of experience: 24 Published: Feb 2, 2023Views: 118    Cannabis (1), MDMA (3), LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Bad Trips (6), Combinations (3)
